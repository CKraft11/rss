			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight is seeking an intern to join our politics team for spring 2022. We’re looking for a current student or recent graduate who has experience using data to tell stories about politics — ranging from how Americans feel about an important political issue to unpacking big political and electoral trends.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The intern’s main role will be to report and write stories, but the internship will also involve working closely with the politics team and other parts of the newsroom on a number of collaborative projects. See FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/audio-features/when-women-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“When Women Run” project</a> or our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep dive into police misconduct and settlements</a> for examples of big, cross-newsroom projects that interns have contributed to.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ideal candidate will have journalism experience and a background in data analysis in addition to some experience covering or analyzing American politics (whether from a journalism class, school paper, job or internship). But “politics” doesn’t just mean electoral politics. It could mean you have experience reporting on policy issues, social movements, polarization in your community or something else. Interpret it broadly because we will too!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Politics Intern will report to the Politics Editor, but as a small newsroom, we’re looking for someone eager to collaborate with colleagues across the newsroom. The Politics Intern is a U.S.-based remote position. Applicants should be able to commit to a full-time schedule from January until May and must be a current student or have graduated in the past 18 months. Apply with a cover letter and resume at the <a href="https://jobs.disneycareers.com/job/united-states/politics-data-reporting-internship-fivethirtyeight-spring-2022-remote/391/19822982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney jobs portal</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Pitch, report and write stories on American politics.</li><li>Conduct original data analysis for stories and bigger features and projects.</li><li>Collaborate with other reporters and teams across the newsroom, including our visual journalists, video journalists and copy desk.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Basic Qualifications</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Journalism experience, whether from a class, working at a student publication or through a job or internship.</li><li>Experience analyzing data — again, experience from a class, student publication or previous job or internship is absolutely fine!</li><li>Some experience reporting on politics.</li><li>Knowledge of FiveThirtyEight and the kinds of journalism we create.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A background in statistics or experience working with R.</li></ul>]]></description>

			<title>Why There Hasn’t Been A Mass Exodus Of Teachers</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This article is a collaboration between FiveThirtyEight and </em><a href="http://fullerproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Fuller Project</em></a><em>, a nonprofit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sarah Caswell is stressed about her job every day. The science and special-education teacher in Philadelphia sees things going wrong everywhere she looks. Her high school students have been falling behind during the COVID-19 pandemic, the students and even the teachers in her school rarely wear masks, and a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-shooting-2021-lincoln-high-school-20211018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting just outside her school</a> in October left a bystander dead and a 16-year-old student in the hospital with critical injuries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She’s unhappy. But her solution isn’t to quit — it’s to get more involved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We need to double down,” Caswell said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She isn’t the only one who thinks so. Throughout the past year, surveys and polls have pointed to an oncoming crisis in education: a mass exodus of unhappy K-12 teachers. Surveys from unions and education-research groups have warned that anywhere from <a href="https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/safety-concerns-over-covid-19-driving-some-educators-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-fourth</a> to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-teachers-considering-leaving-the-classroom-301289190.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> of U.S. educators were considering a career change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Except that doesn’t seem to have happened. The most recent statistics, though still limited, suggest that while some districts are reporting significant faculty shortages, the country overall is not facing a sudden teacher shortage. Any staffing shortages for full-time K-12 teachers appear far less severe and widespread <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/would-you-manage-70-children-and-a-15-ton-vehicle-for-18-an-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than those for support staff like substitute teachers, bus drivers and paraprofessionals</a>, who are paid less and encounter more job instability.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a female-dominated profession, these numbers notably contrast trends showing that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-relationship-between-school-closures-and-female-labor-force-participation-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women in particular</a> have been leaving their jobs at high rates throughout COVID-19. While labor-force participation for women dropped significantly at the start of the pandemic, and <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/September-Jobs-Day.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still remains about 2 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels</a>, teachers by and large seem to be staying at their jobs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, why have the doomsday scenarios not come true? There are many explanations — and the ways they overlap tell us something about the state of American schools, the inner workings of America’s economy and the way gender shapes the American workforce.</p>

A <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1108-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationally representative survey of teachers</a> by RAND Education and Labor in late January and early February found that educators were feeling depressed and burned out from their jobs at higher rates than the general population. These rates were higher for female teachers, with 82 percent reporting frequent job-related stress compared with 66 percent of male teachers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the survey, 1 in 4 teachers — particularly <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-black-teachers-walk-away" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black teachers</a> — reported that they were considering leaving their jobs at the end of the school year. Only 1 in 6 said the same before the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the data on teacher employment shows a system that is stretched, not shattered. In an <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-bad-are-school-staffing-shortages-what-we-learned-by-asking-administrators/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EdWeek Research Center report</a> released in October, a significant number of district leaders and principals surveyed — a little less than half — said that their district had struggled to hire a sufficient number of full-time teachers. This number paled in comparison, though, with the nearly 80 percent of school leaders who said they were struggling to find substitute teachers, the nearly 70 percent who said they were struggling to find bus drivers and the 55 percent who said they were struggling to find paraprofessionals. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg" alt="A kindergarten teacher preps her classroom" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Yalonda M. James / The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">More concrete jobs data suggests that school employees have largely stayed put. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer public-education professionals quit their jobs between the months of April and August the past two years than did so during that same time immediately before the pandemic. In 2019, around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10092019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">470,000 public-education employees quit their jobs</a> between April and August compared with around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10062020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">285,000 in the same period in 2020</a> and around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10122021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300,000 in 2021</a>. Notably, this data includes both full-time teachers, support staff and higher-education employees, though teachers make up a majority of those included, says Chad Aldeman, policy director of Edunomics Lab, an education-policy research center, at Georgetown University. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Experts point to multiple reasons for this trend. While women have been disproportionately affected by mass COVID-related job losses, teachers haven’t faced the types of widespread layoffs experienced by workers in other professions — including other types of public school employees like bus drivers. Moreover, relative to other types of jobs disproportionately held by women, teachers have more job stability and receive more generous benefits. Educators often get into their work for specifically mission-driven purposes, too, making them uniquely positioned to decide to stay at their jobs, even during particularly stressful periods, experts say. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The early indicators we have show turnover hasn’t spiked this year as we anticipated,” said Aldeman. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, he said, data shows that the hiring crunch might be because there are more jobs to hire for. Vacancies have increased, suggesting that districts might be beefing up hiring after a year of uncertainty and an influx in federal aid. In other words, labor shortages are not totally attributable to increased turnover. And while <a href="https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2021/9/10/22666840/covid-stress-chicago-public-schools-teachers-stay-put-vacancies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early data</a> on <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/ny-teacher-retirements-pandemic-20210830-7uhkzispm5akxf6mraygjxlclm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teacher retirements</a> suggests that there might have been increases on the margins in some places, fears of mass retirements have not borne out so far. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg" alt="A substitute teacher helps a student during class" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Terry Pierson / The Press-Enterprise via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Still, some local districts are hurting. Sasha Pudelski, the assistant director for policy and advocacy for the School Superintendents Association, has spoken to school leaders around the country who are facing teacher shortages, sometimes at crisis levels. But her sense is that these shortages are uneven depending on a district’s resource level and how well they’re able to pay. Based on what she’s heard from school-district leaders, she suspects shortages are more acute in low-income communities with a lower tax base for teacher salaries, potentially causing a further shortage of educators from underrepresented groups, who disproportionately teach in these areas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, <a href="https://4f730634-e809-4181-92d7-ed1dc705414a.filesusr.com/ugd/1394b9_7709c1ab926247469c2aa9c076b977bc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fall 2021 study</a> of school-staffing shortages throughout the state of Washington shows that high-poverty districts are facing significantly more staffing challenges than their more affluent counterparts. In some places, there are significant numbers of unfilled positions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Study co-author Dan Goldhaber, who directs the Center for Education Data &amp; Research at the University of Washington and serves as a vice president of the American Institutes for Research, is cautious about drawing conclusions about such an abnormal year. But he believes that fears of teacher shortages in the past have been overblown, pointing to a study by the Wheelock Education Policy Center at Boston University, which found that teacher-turnover rates in Massachusetts remained largely stable throughout the <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwheelockpolicycenter.org%2Feffective-teachers%2Fcovid-19-and-ma-teacher-workforce%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cdgoldhaber%40air.org%7C35aa3baf2e2f468e0ea608d9a1f86aed%7C9ea45dbc7b724abfa77cc770a0a8b962%7C0%7C0%7C637718910633329236%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=a6wr9mYyqpFTXcKn1iBX9JdJ03qD%2FX%2FrIt2cqKNgCq0%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020-21 school year</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I have seen three different waves of people talking about teacher shortages, and I’ve seen policy briefs come out that suggest there are going to be 100,000 to 200,000 slots that can’t be filled for teachers,” said Goldhaber. “Those kinds of dire predictions have never come to pass.”</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather than lean out, a significant number of teachers have become more engaged in workplace issues amid the turbulence. Evan Stone, the co-founder and co-CEO of Educators for Excellence, points to recent union elections in multiple cities that have seen unprecedented turnout. In late September and early October, for example, nearly 16,000 United Teachers Los Angeles members <a href="https://www.utla.net/news/utla-members-approve-agreement-lausd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in a vote over school-reopening issues</a>, while <a href="https://utlaelections.org/results/2020-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 6,000 voted in a 2020 election</a> of union leaders. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the American Federation of Teachers saw a slight increase in membership this year. Randi Weingarten, the union’s president, traveled across the country this fall to get a sense of how her members were feeling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every place I went, yes, there’s trepidation, a lot of agita over the effects of COVID, but there’s a real joy of people being back in school with their kids,” said Weingarten. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this increase in union participation isn’t across the board. The National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, has lost around 47,000 members, or about 1.6 percent of its membership, since this point last year, according to figures the NEA supplied to FiveThirtyEight and The Fuller Project. The organization attributes most of the losses to a decline in hiring at the higher-education level and decreased employment for public K-12 support staff.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg" alt="The Providence Teachers Union holds a rally for safe school reopening" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Some teachers unions have rallied for stronger safety protocols to help protect teachers and students. <p>Barry Chin / The Boston Globe via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For teachers like Caswell, the past two years have driven her to get more involved with her union, unhappy as she may be at her job and unsafe as she may feel. (A spokesperson for Philadelphia public schools notes that the district has an indoor mask mandate that all individuals are expected to follow.) For a single mother supporting three kids, quitting isn’t an option. Caswell can’t imagine switching schools within the same district either, even though she describes her work environment as miserable. Her students, some of whom she’s worked with for years, mean too much to her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Caswell has started working to organize members in her school to represent their interests on a larger level and effect change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I can’t just walk out, though there’s definitely moments where I would have liked to,” said Caswell. “We’re tired. The demands keep coming, and we can’t do it all.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She sees her advocacy as directly related to her gender, believing the profession receives less support and resources than it deserves because the composition of the workforce is largely female. Indeed, union representation, and the perks that come along with it, is something that other sectors facing massive shortages of female workers, like service and hospitality industries, don’t necessarily receive. As of 2017, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/participation-in-teachers-unions-is-down-and-likely-to-tumble-further/2017/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 70</a> percent of teachers participated in a union or professional association, according to federal data. By comparison, the same is true for only about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/health/covid-health-workers-unions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 percent of nurses</a>, another predominantly female workforce. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Female professions are undervalued by society, and I think that’s part of the reason teachers are <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t03.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more densely organized</a> than almost any other worker in America right now,” said Weingarten. </p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, plenty of teachers are quitting — and they’re quitting at least in part because of the pandemic. According to a survey by the RAND Corporation, almost half of former public school teachers who left the field since March 2020 cited <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2021/02/22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 as the driving factor</a>. The pandemic exacerbated already-stressful working conditions, forcing teachers to work longer hours and navigate a challenging transition to remote learning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For some teachers, the decision to quit was easy. High school science educator Sara Mielke, who had recently returned to teaching after taking time off to stay home with children, quit her job several weeks into this school year over the lack of COVID-safety protocols in her Pflugerville, Texas, school. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I felt like I couldn’t trust these people to prioritize safety in general,” said Mielke, who adds that she was chastised by school administrators for showing her students accurate information about vaccine effectiveness and enforcing the school’s mandatory mask policy. (The district did not respond to a request for comment.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other teachers say that while they wanted to leave, the prospect of saying goodbye to their students was too much. So, they decided to stay and push for changes.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="709" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg" alt="Students hold signs during a drive by parade for Teacher Appreciation Week" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Jessica Rinaldi / The Boston Globe via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That was part of the calculation for Kiffany Cody, a special-education teacher in Gwinnett County, Georgia. She took a stress-related medical leave of absence last year, in part because she felt her district was neglecting worker safety. But Cody returned to the classroom after several months, noting she is “really, really, really passionate about the kids.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year she’s banded together with other educators to speak out about unsafe working conditions and start tracking violations of district safety protocols. They’ve become close friends, a support group who feel determined to hold their district accountable and make schools kinder and safer for students and staff. (A representative from Gwinnett County schools said that the “district follows the CDC recommendations for schools regarding layered mitigation strategies, isolation, and quarantine guidelines to promote a healthy and safe environment for our students, staff, and visitors.”)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Every now and then, Cody looks at LinkedIn and ponders working in another field. But for now, she’s in it for the long haul — for her students. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re trying to work within the system to do what we can to help the students,” said Cody. “We can leave and find jobs in other districts and industries, but at the end of the day, the kids can’t go anywhere.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Facebook’s algorithm<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s platform runs on a system of many algorithms that all have different functions and interact with one another. This system is colloquially referred to as “the algorithm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> is its superpower — and its kryptonite. Yes, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/tech/facebook-whistleblower-algorithms-fix/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leads to higher engagement</a> that earns the company <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-reports-9-billion-profit-day-documents-highlight-internal-ang-rcna3757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions of dollars</a>, but it’s also tied to some of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/17/facebook-cambridge-analytica-kogan-data-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company’s biggest scandals</a>. Last month, when the Facebook Papers — a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/explainer-facebook-papers-80766584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trove of leaked corporate documents</a> provided to reporters and Congress — were released, a mountain of news coverage blamed the algorithm for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spread of misinformation</a> and divisive content, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radicalizing users</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-23/how-facebook-s-algorithm-led-a-new-india-user-to-fake-news-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to protect them</a> from some of the most graphic content on the site.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the algorithm is to blame, can Facebook change the algorithm to make it better? What would that look like? To find out, I interviewed 12 leading experts on data and computer science, as well as former Facebook employees, and asked them to propose changes that could help the algorithm suck less. What I got was a range of ideas about how Facebook could start to solve this problem, or whether a solution is even possible. Some are more radical than others, so I’ve categorized these ideas from mild to spicy<strong> </strong>(though we know Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/style/mark-zuckerberg-meta-jokes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prefers it sweet</a>). </p>



<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> <strong>Mild takes:</strong> <strong>Limiting shares and more user controls</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many experts pointed out that, along with identifying some of the problems with the algorithm, the Facebook Papers also included a number of possible solutions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some of the internal research found shockingly simple tweaks [to improve the algorithm],” said Noah Giansiracusa, a mathematics professor at Bentley University and author of “How Algorithms Create and Prevent Fake News.” “For example, if you limit the number of reshares, that will actually reduce the amount of disinformation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Resharing is a crucial way that Facebook gets engaging content into users’ newsfeeds. It allows content to travel through Facebook networks to get in front of users who wouldn’t otherwise see it, and it’s how you wind up with viral content, <a href="https://time.com/3117501/als-ice-bucket-challenge-videos-on-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for better</a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/21/1030038616/facebooks-most-viewed-article-in-early-2021-raised-doubt-about-covid-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for worse</a>. Many of the experts I spoke to mentioned creating “friction” or “speed bumps” to slow down bad content — like disinformation, hate speech or extreme content — before it goes viral. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/22/1048543513/facebook-groups-jan-6-insurrection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internal research at Facebook</a> found that limiting “deep reshares” (where content is reshared not only by the original poster’s network of friends or followers, but also their friends’ friends, and their friends’ friends’ friends, and so on) of political content could reduce misinformation shared via external links by 25 percent and reduce misinformation found in images (think misleading memes) by half. Facebook implemented these changes, but only temporarily. The site <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/05/inside-feed-reduce-remove-inform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does moderate misleading content</a> by removing it if it violates the site’s community standards, and downranking content that the algorithm deems likely to be harmful, but the experts I spoke to still felt there was a gap where harmful content is slipping through.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow and the director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative at the German Marshall Fund, suggested Facebook adopt a kind of “circuit breaker,” where the share button is automatically but temporarily removed on content that starts getting deep reshares very quickly, until the content can be evaluated. Something like this, Kornbluh noted, could have stopped the disinformation video “Plandemic” (which falsely cast doubts on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the safety of vaccines) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/technology/plandemic-movie-youtube-facebook-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from getting millions of views</a> before it was ultimately removed from the site. Katie Harbath, the former public policy director at Facebook, noted that WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook’s parent company, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/facebook-announces-changing-company-meta/story?id=80683908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a>) was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/whatsapps-new-limit-cuts-virality-of-highly-forwarded-messages-by-70/#:~:text=In%20one%20of%20the%20biggest,billion%20users%20on%20April%207." target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to cut the virality of similar kinds</a> of “deep reshared” content by limiting how many contacts a user could forward a message to at one time, and said similar limits on sharing could be helpful at Facebook. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The algorithm could also identify “bad actors” who have repeatedly shared misleading content and demote all of their future posts, said Nathaniel Persily, co-director of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center. “They should always be demoted in the newsfeed, regardless if they’re talking about baseball or QAnon,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple experts also pointed to more prominent user controls, to allow users to decide what content they’d like to see. While Facebook does offer quite a lot of user control options, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/10/21/170668/algorithm-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies have shown</a> most users are unaware of how they work, and there’s not an intuitive way for users to signal dissatisfaction with content, said Karrie Karahalios, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has studied user experience with Facebook. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roddy Lindsay, a former Facebook data scientist who went on to co-found a startup, wants the algorithm to prioritize content that users are likely to deem “good for the world.” It’s an admittedly subjective metric, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook experimented with it</a> by having users rate content on whether they felt it was “good” or “bad” for the world. It then used that feedback to train the algorithm to prioritize only the “good” stuff. Facebook researchers found this reduced the amount of negative content in users’ feeds, but it also reduced the number of times users logged onto Facebook, so a watered-down version of it was ultimately adopted instead. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not that these algorithms can’t be improved,” Lindsay said. “The problem is that the only decision makers for what these algorithms optimize for are the companies.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We know from the Facebook Papers that some of these recommendations were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-covid-vaccine-misinformation-c8bbc569be7cc2ca583dadb4236a0613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented slowly</a> or for a limited period of time, while others were, at least at the time, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-papers-badge-posts-former-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected</a>. It’s unclear which, if any, of the recommendations from the papers have since been implemented at Facebook — Mari Melguizo, a spokesperson for the platform, pointed to the site’s recently published “<a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-ranking/types-of-content-we-demote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content distribution guidelines</a>,” which list the kind of content that’s demoted on the site, including spam and clickbait. “These working documents from years ago show our efforts to understand these issues and don’t reflect the product and policy solutions we’ve implemented since,” Melguizo said.</p>



<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥"> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f336.png" alt="🌶"> <strong>Medium takes:</strong> <strong>More boring feeds</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some experts felt Facebook’s algorithm needed a more substantial overhaul to tackle its worst byproducts, including changes that might make Facebook slightly less fun for users. Laura Edelson, a computer science Ph.D. candidate at New York University who <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22612151/laura-edelson-facebook-nyu-ad-observatory-social-media-researcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies disinformation and political advertising on social media</a>, said one thing revealed in the Facebook Papers was the algorithm’s prioritization of something called “downstream meaningful social interactions.” (Which is also how I describe my Friday nights.) In a nutshell, imagine two pieces of content: Post A is something you, the Facebook user, are highly likely to engage with, but nobody else in your network is. Post B is something you’re less likely to engage with, but many people in your network are. By prioritizing downstream MSI, the algorithm is more likely to show you post B, even though it might be less relevant to you. That might expose you to more polarizing or extreme content than you would like to see. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internal research at Facebook showed</a> that reducing how much the algorithm considered this metric when it came to posts about civic (i.e., political) and health information helped reduce the spread of misinformation, and <a href="https://twitter.com/davegillis/status/1446371819531890689" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook did implement</a> the changes for those categories (and is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently experimenting</a> with further reducing how much the algorithm considers the potential for comments and shares on political content), but Edelson argued those changes should be made for all content on the site. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Facebook is not perfect at detecting these categories — far from it — and they’re particularly bad at the beginning of a piece of content’s life,” Edelson said. “That means it’s entirely possible that it won’t detect that civic content is civic until after it’s already gone viral.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jinyan Zang, a researcher at the Public Interest Tech Lab at Harvard University, said one thing Facebook could do is shift the balance of what it deems valuable. Rather than focusing on quantitative metrics like clicks and reshares, the algorithm could prioritize qualitative metrics (like how positive or relevant a post might be to a user). You might be more likely to engage with your cousin’s college boyfriend’s post about a conspiracy theory, but you might <em>prefer</em> to see a photo of your neighbor’s kids’ Halloween costumes. Facebook’s algorithm takes a lot of factors into account when ranking content, including more qualitative measures, so there’s no reason it couldn’t crank up that dial. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another more dramatic change would be eliminating the ranking algorithm for the newsfeed altogether, and returning to a reverse-chronological feed. In other words, just show everybody everything people posted, rather than trying to personalize the feed just for you (and whatever the algorithm thinks you’re most likely to click, or rage-click). This notion is controversial. Some of the experts I spoke to said it would never work because it incentivizes quantity over quality — a fast road to spam — while also making it less likely that you’ll see anything relevant, interesting or engaging (in every sense of the word) on your feed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But proponents of this idea (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-05/could-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-bring-back-time-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Facebook whistleblower</a> Frances Haugen) say the downsides to reverting to a reverse chronological feed may be outweighed by the benefits. A reverse chronological feed would, by definition, favor content from users who post frequently, so your newsfeed could easily get clogged with posts from a particularly active group you’re in, or memes from a particularly bored acquaintance you forgot you friended. “You would be exposed to things that are more mundane, but that content plays an important role — we’re not all having the best day ever,” Lindsay, the former Facebook data scientist, said. “People say it’s boring or noisy or has content from random pages, and my response to that is, ‘Yes, of course, but that’s where user controls come in.’” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the furthest end of the take Scoville scale are two ideas, one optimistic and the other pessimistic: </p>



<ol><li>Facebook can completely revamp its astronomically successful and profitable business plan</li><li>Facebook is irredeemable, and should be forced to fail </li></ol>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jeff Allen and Sahar Massachi are both former Facebook employees who worked on integrity teams (the groups tasked with finding ways to deal with all of the worst bits of Facebook, like disinformation and extremism). They said that as long as Facebook’s mission (“to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”) and metrics (user engagement) are at odds, there’s no amount of algorithmic tweaks that will solve its problems. Instead, Facebook needs to use different metrics that align with its stated values to measure its success. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you’re counting harmful content towards your success, you’re just setting yourself up for internal conflict,” Allen said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some experts felt that the blue sky version of Facebook realigning its metrics with its values simply wouldn’t work. I asked each of the interviewees what they would do if I waved a magic wand and gave them total control over Facebook. “I would turn off Facebook and apologize to the people of the world,” said Cathy O’Neil, a data scientist and algorithmic auditor. “They can’t actually solve their problems.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">O’Neil argued that as long as Facebook is a for-profit company that earns revenue through ads, it will only ever be able to play catchup with negative content, and that any external pressures like regulation that would actually be effective would only end up making Facebook so unprofitable that the business would collapse. Imran Ahmed, the founding CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, made a similar argument, noting that asking Facebook to make changes to an algorithm that — from a business perspective — works quite effectively is “the axiom of insanity.” Instead, he called for regulations that would create costs to Facebook for the harm its product creates as an incentive for change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The cost of the harms created by Facebook are not in any way internal to Facebook. Users pay the price and society pays the price,” Ahmed said. “Impunity leads to terrible things, and we’re seeing an experiment in impunity now. “</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the experts I spoke to almost unanimously called for regulation. Blue sky ideas are great, but we’ve been trusting Facebook to get better for 15 years, and it’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguably worse</a> than it’s ever been. It might be time to put some limits on its superpower, and its supreme power.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Following the elections in New Jersey and Virginia, Patrick Murray, the director of the New Jersey-based Monmouth University Polling Institute, wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/11/pollster-i-blew-it-maybe-its-time-to-get-rid-of-election-polls-opinion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘I Blew It.’ Maybe It’s Time To Get Rid Of Election Polls</a>.” Essentially he said that the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/monmouth-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A-rated Monmouth Poll</a> was significantly off in the New Jersey governor’s race and had been off in other recent elections. As a result, he suggested that perhaps pollsters should stop doing election polling altogether and just stick to issue polling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Murray tells us why he came to that conclusion and what a world without horse-race polling might look like. Later in the podcast, <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenneth Rogoff</a>, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, joins to discuss the causes of the recent high levels of inflation and how this is shaping Americans’ perspectives of the economy.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In a normal election year, Richard Leonardon, 60, would be supporting a Republican or independent political candidate. But during at least one race in his lifetime, Leonardon broke his habit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was 1996, when he was living in Pennsylvania’s 14th District, long represented by William Coyne, a Democrat. The Republican candidate, Bill Ravotti, didn’t really stand a chance of defeating Coyne, but Leonardon still couldn’t bring himself to vote for Ravotti. Instead, Leonardon wrote his own name on the ballot.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year, the only other candidate on the ballot was Paul Scherrer of the Socialist Equality Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> That’s because, as a gay man, Leonardon found certain <a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19981024debate5.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments Ravotti made about gays and lesbians</a> unsettling. Leonardon stressed that “someone does not have to be very ‘pro-gay’ to get my vote.” He just doesn’t want politicians to espouse openly anti-gay views, adding that his policy when assessing political candidates is generally “I won’t discuss it if you won’t discuss it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the fact that Leonardon voted for a Republican even once — and has continued to support Republican or independent candidates — is notable because most lesbian, gay and bisexual voters tend to identify as Democrats.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight did not look at transgender Americans’ political beliefs for this story. Polling data for this segment of the electorate is sparse; plus, whether someone is transgender is separate from their sexual orientation. We also were not able to look at the political beliefs of Americans who identify as queer because of a lack of polling data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> Lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans still represent a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329708/lgbt-identification-rises-latest-estimate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small share of the adult population</a> (about 5 percent), but a 2016 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-voters-remain-a-solidly-democratic-bloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> study found that 82 percent of LGB voters identified as or leaned Democratic while only 18 percent identified as or leaned toward the GOP. Moreover, LGB voters were much more likely than the electorate overall to hold broadly liberal political beliefs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there’s still a small but growing number of LGB voters who are loyal to the GOP. This is true for many reasons, but one of the biggest threads I stumbled upon in my interviews and research is that many LGB Republicans see their sexuality and politics as separate. They’re also more likely to factor normal GOP dogma — favoring lower taxes, less federal government intervention and some restrictions on abortion — into their identity. On top of that, most believe that the party <em>has</em> changed a lot in its treatment of same-sex couples. During his presidential campaign in 2016, for example, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-who-cast-himself-as-pro-lgbt-now-under-fire-from-democrats-for-rolling-back-protections/2019/05/30/95c04e96-8306-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made overt appeals</a> to LGBTQ voters, and ahead of the 2020 election, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/trump-lgbtq-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced an LGBTQ coalition</a>, with Richard Grenell, the openly gay U.S. ambassador to Germany at the time, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/26/grenell-to-join-trump-campaign-283026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigning on Trump’s behalf</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More generally speaking, Republican voters also seem to have changed their attitude toward issues like same-sex marriage. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup</a>, which has been tracking Americans’ support for marriage equality since 1996, a record-high 70 percent of all adults now believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by the law and that same-sex couples should have the same rights as opposite-sex couples who are married. And for the first time ever, a majority of Republicans (55 percent) also say they support same-sex marriage. </p>

In 2003, then-Sen. Rick Santorum, who would go on to run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, notoriously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/politics/rick-santorum-homosexuality-comments-same-sex-marriage/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality</a>, and in his 2004 reelection bid, then-President George W. Bush called for a constitutional amendment to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/05/same.sex.marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban same-sex marriage</a>, something he proposed again in 2006. These examples aren’t some relic of how the GOP used to operate either. In October, just before he was elected governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin said he <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/11/glenn-youngkin-virginia-marriage-equality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was personally opposed to same-sex marriage</a>. And even Trump, for all his courting of LGBTQ voters, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/justice-department-colorado-cake/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sided with the Colorado baker</a> who argued in a 2018 Supreme Court case that his religious beliefs were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jun/04/gay-cake-ruling-supreme-court-same-sex-wedding-colorado-baker-decision-latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justification for not making wedding cakes</a> for same-sex couples. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://turnbulldugarte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stuart Turnbull-Dugarte</a>, a political science professor at the University of Southampton who has done research on how sexual identity affects vote choice,<strong> </strong>noted that this not-so-distant history is one big reason why there’s a strong correlation between identifying as LGB and voting Democratic. “The Democrats, while being slow on endorsing [same-sex marriage] pre-Obama, have always been the more pro-LGB of the two parties, and LGB voters have rewarded these pro-LGB stances by awarding Democratic candidates with their votes on polling day,” he told me. Turnbull-Dugarte added that even in cases where Democrats are somewhat lukewarm on issues related to LGBTQ rights, they’re still often more open compared with Republicans. “Between a silent Democrat and an anti-gay Republican, LGBs know which candidate is going to improve — or at least not damage — their welfare.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there are signs that the GOP is making inroads with this bloc: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-voters-remain-a-solidly-democratic-bloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Pew</a>, which used exit polling data, 22 percent of LGB voters backed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, while 24 percent backed Republican candidates during the 2014 midterm elections. Some estimates also suggest that Trump won as much as 27 percent of the LGBT vote in 2020 — which, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/01/had-lgbt-voters-stayed-home-trump-might-have-won-2020-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if true, would be the highest share of support</a> any Republican presidential nominee has ever received from this group.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think I’m accepted in the Republican Party. A lot of Republicans don’t like gays, but they say, ‘What you do is your own business,’” Leonardon said. “I don’t feel the Republican Party has an anti-gay bias nearly as much as it used to, particularly because the older Republicans have died off and the ones 50 and under just don’t care as much.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that younger Republicans are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-some-socially-liberal-gen-z-voters-arent-leaving-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close to their Democratic peers</a> in supporting LGBTQ rights. But there’s still a tension some LGB Republicans must grapple with when navigating their political identity: While the GOP writ large has gradually <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">softened its stance</a> on same-sex marriage, the six people I spoke with still have to square existing within a party where <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/06/27/there-is-now-a-dramatic-generational-divide-over-white-evangelical-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some prominent voting blocs like white evangelical Christians still don’t <em>fully </em>embrace</a> the sexual orientation of LGB Americans — and where party leaders sometimes still espouse <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/09/metro/republican-who-made-anti-gay-remarks-says-she-wont-be-bullied-into-resigning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homophobic sentiments</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, a few people told me that it’s hard for them to feel accepted within larger LGBTQ communities due to their political beliefs. But, for the most part, how much they feel the need to address that tension runs in tandem with how central being lesbian, gay or bisexual is in their life.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Being a gay conservative, you always find yourself hiding one part of yourself from another and switching in between these two communities and never being able to find that balance,” said E.A., a 24-year-old in Washington, D.C., who asked to be identified by his initials out of fear of retribution for his beliefs and sexual orientation. “I can’t speak for other people, but for my friends and I, this is something we commonly run into.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">E.A. isn’t alone on this. Several people I spoke to said it’s easier to be lesbian, gay or bisexual in Republican circles than a Republican in LGBTQ+ circles. That may have to do with one of the biggest differences between LGB Republicans and LGB Democrats: that most LGB Republicans see their sexuality as separate from — or secondary to — their political identity. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to an October 2020 study from the <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgb-party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law</a>, 54 percent of LGB Republicans said their sexual orientation was an insignificant<em> </em>part of who they are compared with 38 percent of LGB Democrats who felt the same. Conversely, 85 percent of LGB Democrats said that being LGB was a “very important” aspect of themselves versus 68 percent of LGB Republicans.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1292" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“While most LGBs are strong Democrats, the minority who do ‘break ranks’ with the group tend to have a lower sense of identification with the LGB identity,” said Turnbull-Dugarte. “These are likely to be people who, whilst they may have a same-sex partner, might not necessarily be participants in gay culture or be fans of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Leonardon told me he fell into this bucket. “My sexual orientation being gay is just a tiny part of me and doesn’t really affect where I stand politically,” he said. “I think the Democratic Party tends to pander too much to various groups, and I think we should look at people more as individuals than as part of a group.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">E.A. agreed. “I don’t see someone’s sexuality as a defining factor of one’s character or personality. I see my sexuality as a part of me, as I would see my arm or any other facet that creates who I am. It doesn’t define whether I lean more left or right,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another important distinction, Turnbull-Dugarte noted, is that LGB Republican voters are far less likely to view society as being biased or discriminatory toward the LGBTQ+ population. “In other words, they do not share the claims of the LGBTQ+ ‘collective’ as being a group subjected to systematic marginalization,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s true that in my interviews, many said they didn’t think Republicans were actively vilifying them anymore. Moreover, some said that the party simply didn’t talk about same-sex marriage as much as it used to. “I feel like gay rights isn’t an issue now since it’s pretty much settled,” said Nestor Moto Jr., a 26-year-old gay Republican living in California. “The court has already decided.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that doesn’t mean being in the GOP still isn’t without difficulties. Some of the people I spoke with felt as if they had to hide or suppress parts of their identity because they worried about being alienated either due to their sexuality or their politics. This is something the Williams Institute study suggested was a <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgb-party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common sentiment shared among</a> LGB Republicans versus LGB Democrats. Per its research, 46 percent of LGB Republicans (compared with 72 percent of LGB Democrats) said they felt like a part of the LGBT community. Meanwhile, only 45 percent of LGB Republicans (and 70 percent of LGB Democrats) said they felt a bond with the LGB community. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I spoke to Alex P., a 32-year-old bisexual man living in California who does not want his last name used due to privacy concerns. He told me he’s happily married to a woman with whom he’s open about his struggles, but beyond that, only a few close friends and family members know about his sexual orientation. He added, however, that due to his religion and political beliefs, he’s never acted as he says “outwardly gay”  — even though he’s been inclined to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I didn’t really come to terms with my bisexuality until I was in my mid-20s, but I’m also a Christian and I believe the Bible is authoritative,” he said. “My personal preferences are secondary to that.” He added, however, that he thinks some conservatives “are not compassionate” toward people who are not heterosexual. “One of the errors conservatives make is they assume because one is LGBT, that makes one a liberal or someone who doesn’t care about the morality of their sexual behavior. My hope is that society would understand that LGBT people are not a uniform bloc and that some do not view their sexuality as their primary identity.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">E.A., meanwhile, said he’s run into issues explaining his politics and sexuality with people on dating apps, in particular. “There’s been a number of times where I’ve interacted with people and the first question is, ‘Well, you’re not a Republican, right?’” he told me. “On Hinge, if you have ‘moderate’ in your profile, it means you’re conservative. There’s small, nuanced things one always has to navigate as a gay Republican, and I don’t think straight Republicans or gay Democrats have to worry about that.” Moto said he’s run into similar issues: “It’s easier to tell Republicans that I’m gay than to tell gay people I’m a Trump supporter. I lost a couple friends back [in 2016] and people were very hostile; that’s one reason I got out of politics because I didn’t want people to continue to harass me.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But of the LGB Republicans I spoke with, none seemed to hold any deep-seated resentment toward the GOP over negative interactions they’ve had regarding their sexuality. In fact, they all seemed to really agree with the party’s message, and many said they also thought that Democrats had gone too far left in recent years. Leonardon, for example, told me he’s been loyal to Republican or independent candidates because he prioritizes other issues — “tax issues, government-regulation issues [and] free-speech issues.” Meanwhile, Barb Hauxwell, a 61-year-old lesbian from Oklahoma, said she’s firmly pro-Trump and would never go back to voting for Democrats (which she did before she and her sister took over her family’s business). “I’m fiscally conservative. I’m still a Christian — it doesn’t matter whether I’m gay or not. I’m against abortion,” she said. “Pretty much everything the conservative party is for, I’m with them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, LGB Republicans make up a small slice of the LGBTQ+ community and an even smaller slice of the electorate, but for now at least, the Republican platform seemed to hold more weight for them than any negativity and vilification they might experience because of their sexuality. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hauxwell put it bluntly: “Sex is only a small part of our lives, and now that I’m older, I don’t even have it, so it doesn’t matter.”</p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">You can see it at the grocery store, the gas station and your heating bill (though, mercifully, <a href="https://qz.com/2087483/alcohol-and-air-travel-resisted-high-us-inflation-in-october-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not at the liquor store</a>): Prices are getting higher. Since October of last year, prices for consumer goods have risen 6.2 percent — the biggest year-over-year increase since 1990 — according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released Wednesday</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices are on the rise in nearly every category, including gas, food and housing, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/how-the-supply-chain-caused-current-inflation-and-why-it-might-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely as a result</a> of supply chain disruption, labor shortages and lingering effects of the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/11/10/22775092/inflation-cpi-october-economy-biden-fed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mix</a> of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/economy/consumer-price-inflation-october/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coverage</a> in the media, the prevailing message from officials seems to be “don’t panic.” The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/with-bond-buying-taper-bag-fed-turns-wary-eye-inflation-2021-11-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicts this period</a> of rising prices to be “transitory,” and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/10/1054019175/inflation-surges-to-its-highest-since-1990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are signs</a> that price increases are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/inflation-may-cool-off-in-november-and-december-shipping-data-suggests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to slow</a>. But in the meantime, Americans are worried about inflation, and most blame the Biden administration, according to recent polls. It’s why Biden <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-10/biden-says-addressing-rising-inflation-is-a-priority-for-his-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched gears this week</a>, going from celebrating the passage of his bipartisan infrastructure bill to addressing inflation concerns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you haven’t noticed prices going up, you’re in the minority. Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults said gas prices had gone up “a lot,” and 65 percent said food prices had gone up “a lot,” according to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/87gqotkd1s/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted Nov. 6-9. One in four Americans said they spent more on groceries in October, compared with September, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 3. And <a href="https://scottrasmussen.com/77-have-recently-experienced-sharp-price-increases-while-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Scott Rasmussen national survey</a> conducted Oct. 11-13 found that 77 percent of registered voters had “recently experienced sharp increases in the cost of items they would like to buy.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also anticipating prices to continue to rise, especially as we head into the holiday season. In <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/expected-price-hikes-food-travel-tech-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a different Morning Consult poll</a>, which was conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 1, a majority of Americans anticipated prices for consumer tech, food, travel, toys and jewelry would be higher this year than in previous years, and planned to compensate for the increase by hunting for deals. As the holidays approach, consumers have been most concerned about the cost of meat, produce and dairy, according to the <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Morning Consult poll</a>. Forty-eight percent of Americans were “very concerned” about the cost of meat, 37 percent about produce and 33 percent about dairy. A plurality of consumers (46 percent) said they “often” compared prices to reduce their grocery costs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are not happy about these price increases. In a <a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_DailyKos_monthly_banner_book_2021_10_h82c93.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Kos/Civiqs poll</a> conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 2, 78 percent of registered voters said they were dissatisfied with the price of gas (only 5 percent said they were satisfied) and 75 percent said they were dissatisfied with the price of consumer goods like food, clothing and household items. This dissatisfaction about the price of consumer goods was highest among Republicans, at 92 percent, compared with 57 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of independents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are feeling the price increases in their pocketbooks. That Economist/YouGov poll found 56 percent of Americans said it was at least somewhat difficult to afford gas, with 55 percent saying the same about food and 48 percent saying the same about housing costs. <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-16-19_Complete_National_Topline_October-21-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Fox News poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-19 showed concern about inflation was higher than it’d been for the past four months, with 87 percent of registered voters saying they were “very” or “extremely” concerned about inflation and higher prices.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Polling captures how voters are thinking about inflation as a political issue. A plurality of registered voters (40 percent) said the Biden administration’s policies were “very responsible” for the inflation, and a majority (62 percent) said the administration’s policies were at least “somewhat responsible,” <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/20054637/2110084_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-18. In a <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HHP_October2021_Topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard/Harris poll</a> conducted Oct. 27-28, 56 percent of registered voters said they weren’t confident in the Biden administration’s ability to keep inflation at bay, and 53 percent said the same about the Federal Reserve’s ability. A majority (56 percent) said that Congress passing a $1.5 to $2 trillion social spending bill (such as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-repeats-worries-about-inflation-amid-final-social-spending-bill-n1283670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one they’re currently trying to pass</a>) would lead to more inflation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the public reaction is out of step with expert forecasts, their fears should not be brushed aside. Some economists theorize that, left unchecked, fears about inflation can make the situation worse <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/inflation-expectations-and-what-it-could-mean-for-markets-bmo-capital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by creating a self-fulfilling prophecy</a> in which employees, afraid of rising prices, demand higher wages, the costs of which employers would then cover through raising prices, leading to higher inflation. This is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22576069/inflation-1970s-volcker-powell-federal-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what happened in the 1970s</a>, and it led to nearly double-digit inflation rates. Regardless of how transitory the Fed thinks these price increases will be, Americans are worried right now.</p>

<ul><li>The 2022 midterm elections are a little less than a year away, and an endorsement from Biden, whose approval rating is low, may not be an attractive option for all candidates.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This article is a collaboration between FiveThirtyEight and </em><a href="http://fullerproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Fuller Project</em></a><em>, a nonprofit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One day last spring, Naima Kaidi waited nearly an hour for her kindergartener and first-grader to get home from school. She stood on the corner near her house, but the bus was nowhere to be seen and there was no word why it was so late. Northport Elementary in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, had only recently reopened for in-person classes, and day after day, Kaidi’s family had been struggling with late school bus drop-offs. This day was the worst. Cold and worried, she eventually carried her younger children back home to get her phone and try to find out what was going on — and that was when she got a knock on the door. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was Roberta Steele, who had driven the school bus in Kaidi’s neighborhood for years, there to bring the two children home. Steele knew where the kids on her route lived. She knew who their parents were. And even though it wasn’t her fault that the bus was late, Steele made sure the kids arrived home safely. “She helped me, she [brought] my kids over here,” Kaidi said. Even if the bus system wasn’t reliable, the driver was. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that was last school year. Even then there was already a shortage of bus drivers in the district. Steele said that had been the case for years, though district representatives were quick to point out that there had never been a shortage of this magnitude. This fall, the shortage became dire enough that Steele’s old route — the one where she knew all the kids well enough to take them to their doorsteps when needed — was consolidated out of existence. In October, the district told parents that <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/education/robbinsdale-area-schools-bus-driver-shortage/89-0e254e80-1e44-4171-97c9-6b2d509d1da6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 routes probably wouldn’t be staffed</a> this year. Steele was transferred to a different route with new kids, and sometimes the chaos of route changes and late buses meant she also had to drive kids home from other, equally unfamiliar routes.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg" alt="A school bus drops off students" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The route that Steele drove for years was eliminated by the company that operates buses for the district. <p>Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It isn’t an easy job. The kids don’t behave. Some, unsure of their own addresses, can’t tell Steele where to go. When parents get angry at a system that isn’t working, they blame Steele. And the company that runs the buses has packed her schedule to the point that there’s no longer time left to pee between runs. She’s thinking of quitting, even though she knows that will make things even harder for the families relying on her.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Kaidi’s family spent the first two months of school with no bus at all. Instead of waiting at her corner with other parents, she spent her afternoons sitting in her car in the pickup line outside school. The line backed up for blocks, 40 or 50 cars deep, threading out of the parking lot and down an undulating suburban road. Kaidi had to get there an hour before school ended just to make sure she was near the front. She says she turned down a job so she could do this. Likewise, other parents had to change their hours, lose pay and go without sleep — all to sit in their cars, waiting for their children. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the bus driver shortage continues, parents and drivers, often women on both sides, have been stretched to the breaking point as they try to do more with less — less time, less money, less help, less of a sense of safety and respect. “This problem existed before COVID, but nobody wanted to hear about it, especially the school districts,” said <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10129300/whats-really-causing-the-decimation-of-the-school-bus-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zina Ronca</a>, a driver supervisor for DuVall Bus Service in West Grove, Pennsylvania, who has been <a href="https://stnonline.com/blogs/the-decimation-of-school-bus-contractors-and-the-school-bus-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the industry for nearly two decades</a>. There haven’t been enough school bus drivers nationwide for years. But it took a pandemic to make that shortage visible and painful to more than just the drivers themselves. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg" alt="Parents wait in line in their cars to drop off their kids at an Orlando, Florida elementary school" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>In part because of the bus driver shortages, long lines of cars — like this one in Orlando, Florida — have been a mainstay at schools this fall. <p>Paul Hennessy / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And in that way, what’s happening at Northport Elementary reflects an even bigger problem for schools nationwide. Across the country, reports have documented shortages of substitute teachers, school nurses, cafeteria workers and the paraprofessionals who help teachers manage their workloads and give kids more small-group attention. As with drivers, those shortages existed before anyone had ever heard of COVID-19. The problems were there, waiting, and then the pandemic came along and made them simultaneously more visible and more … just <em>more</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All these jobs are about service and care, at pay scales that simply aren’t competitive with jobs that use similar skills but don’t require child care balanced precariously on top of other demands. And when the people who do those jobs quit, the effects get tangled up with other parts of the economy and other parts of society. Amid the pandemic, individual workers are making choices for themselves and their families that affect other people’s families and jobs in ways nobody quite expected. The bus driver shortage isn’t just a bus driver shortage — it’s a knot nobody knows how to cut. </p>



<hr><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg" alt="Bus driver Roberta Steele" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">When I pictured the village of people who would help me raise my children, the person driving them to and from school didn’t come immediately to mind. But in the third year of school disruption, it turns out that the bus driver is a person in your neighborhood whom you miss when you don’t see them every day. The job involves only a minimal amount of interaction, Roberta Steele told me. But it’s daily interaction. “You know you’re making a difference for some kids, and that brings me great joy,” she said. “I have kids that I had in middle school that are now in high school. And they will walk from the high school to the middle school just to say hi.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele, 50, is a barrel-chested woman with cropped, spiky hair the color of her last name. She comes off as perky and outgoing, basically the vibe of a favorite grade-school gym teacher. She doesn’t have kids of her own but places a lot of value in the role she can play in the lives of other people’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele has been driving a school bus since 2014, all of it for Robbinsdale School District 281, one of those sprawling suburban districts that encompass schools and children in multiple cities on the fringes of Minneapolis. She took the job after leaving the Minneapolis Police Reserve but almost quit in the first two years. The kids were just a lot. A typical school bus can carry 70 children when full. They get bored, or they just plain don’t know how to behave. “I resorted to bribery as a method of training,” she told me, using small treats to manage the threat of prepubescent uprisings. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="774" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg" alt="Students board a school bus while wearing face masks" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Kids have had to navigate a new normal on school buses during the pandemic. But bus shortages aren’t a new normal for school districts. They were there before the pandemic and are still there now. <p>Alex Kormann / Star Tribune via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Today, she can quell most bad behavior with a look delivered through the rearview mirror. Her starting pay, driving a 15-ton vehicle down the winding, narrow roads of inner-ring suburbs while managing the behavior of a small village worth of kids, and for which she needed to take classes and earn a special license, was $14 an hour. “It’s really rewarding, or it can be, if you like children, right?” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But not everyone does. Or, at least, not at that price point. Steele’s entire bus driving career has been marked by not having enough colleagues. She told me she found the job in the first place because the district was recruiting heavily to fill a shortage, though representatives from the district stressed that they had never had a shortage like this before. Nationwide, more than 50 percent of districts have experienced a shortage of drivers every year since at least 2006, according to <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10003422/how-school-bus-driver-shortage-is-linked-to-unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual surveys conducted by School Bus Fleet magazine</a>. Most years, the driver shortage affected more than 70 percent of districts. The lowest the shortage has been in all that time was in the depths of the Great Recession.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Over the years, as shortages continued, Steele’s pay did increase. Today, after a big post-COVID pay raise, she’s making $23.75 per hour, well above the nationwide average starting pay for school bus drivers, $18.82 per hour according to <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/research/download?id=10145046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2021 survey</a>. </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">At year-round, full-time hours — the way the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533058.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculates an annual wage</a> — the average school bus driver makes more than $39,000 a year. But school bus drivers don’t work year-round, full-time hours. “We’re only guaranteed four hours of pay a day,” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are no paid holidays or sick days, she and other bus industry experts say. Benefits vary from company to company, and there’s no guaranteed work at all in summer. “Spring break is all unpaid. Every teacher-compensatory day, every snow day, any time they cannot pay us they will,” Steele said. She added that a recent, failed unionization effort among the Robbinsdale bus drivers started in part as a fight for snow-day pay. </p>

This is part of why the job has long attracted women — particularly mothers — who were able to work while their children were at school. In 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58.5 percent of all school bus drivers were women</a>. The hours are predictable and short, with a gap in the middle of the day when your time is your own, during which some drivers earn money doing other jobs, like working as a mechanic for the bus company, or doing a different caregiving job in schools. And the job comes with unusual perks like the ability to take the bus home, turning the morning commute into a walk to the driveway. At some bus companies and school districts, drivers have the freedom to take their young children on the bus with them during their rounds — a chance to bring in money without adding to the ever-rising cost of day care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/burgoyne-allen-5-things-to-know-about-americas-school-bus-driver-shortage-what-states-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t pay enough to live on</a>. For Steele, the job works only because her partner brings in a paycheck and benefits. Other drivers depend on a second job, performed between roughly 9 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., when they aren’t on the clock. LaShawn Favors, a bus driver in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park, had a second part-time job as a paraprofessional in a school while his wife worked from home in the health-care industry. His route didn’t overlap with where his own kids, who lacked reliable bus service, needed to go, so his wife and his daughter’s boyfriend were stuck shuttling the kids to and from school while Favors rushed from one job to another and back to the first.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Drivers spackle their work lives together this way, with voluntary overtime and luck, and they still struggle. <a href="https://bellwethereducation.org/publication/challenges-and-opportunities-school-transportation-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID didn’t make the job hard</a>, it just made it harder.</p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Pay is the problem, and COVID made it worse by threatening the unique benefits that kept people driving buses, despite the low pay, to begin with. Older drivers suddenly had to deal with the increased risk of sickness and death, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/we-feel-your-grief-remembering-the-1-000-plus-educators-whove-died-of-covid-19/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks that haven’t really been properly calculated</a> anywhere. No one knows how many bus drivers are no longer in their jobs because they <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/mounting-covid-deaths-fuel-school-bus-drivers-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died from COVID-19 infections</a> acquired on the job, because no one is keeping track. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other drivers had no real choice but to find other work during the long months when schools were remote and had no need of them, while drivers who were mothers found themselves trying to juggle home and work in a job they’d taken precisely so they wouldn’t have to do this in the first place. When schools moved to hybrid systems, the districts needed drivers every day, but those drivers’ own kids’ schedules may not have been in sync, said Erin Ducharme, vice chair of membership for the Women in Buses Council and an executive at Bloom Tour and Charter Services in Taunton, Massachusetts. </p>

Like drivers, school nurses are most likely to be women, and they earn far less than what they could get if they took their skills and training elsewhere — as little as <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$58,810 in median annual wages</a> compared with more than $75,000 if they worked in a hospital. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nationwide, there have been reports of shortages of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/09/06/school-cafeterias-are-looking-for-workers-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cafeteria workers</a>, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/no-bus-drivers-custodians-or-subs-whats-really-behind-schools-staffing-shortages/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custodians, substitute teachers</a> and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-staff-shortages-are-crushing-schools/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paraprofessionals</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-bad-are-school-staffing-shortages-what-we-learned-by-asking-administrators/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted by EdWeek Research Center</a> in late September and early October, 40 percent of district leaders and principals said they were experiencing “severe” or “very severe” staffing shortages. The bus driver shortage is part of a larger, longer problem in schools — one that extends beyond the school building. When “women’s jobs” go unfilled, other women, namely moms, pick up the slack — and the effects reverberate across the economy. </p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Caregiving is interconnected. Roberta Steele doesn’t just drive a bus. She drove a bus to pick up and drop off Naima Kaidi’s children. Without Steele’s services, Kaidi still had to get the kids to school. But the task became harder and required her to make more sacrifices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Parents like Kaidi depend on the services of bus drivers, nurses, lunch ladies and subs. Statistically, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/17/the-pandemic-has-highlighted-many-challenges-for-mothers-but-they-arent-necessarily-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the parents who depend on those services the most are moms</a> — they still do more of the parenting labor, and their own jobs become more disrupted when there aren’t other women doing the outsourced work for things like transportation or food preparation. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/12/despite-challenges-at-home-and-work-most-working-moms-and-dads-say-being-employed-is-whats-best-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 Pew Research Center survey</a> of adults in opposite-sex relationships found that 59 percent of women reported handling more of the household chores and responsibilities than their partners, and among those with children under 18 at home, 78 percent of women reported doing more work to manage their children’s activities and schedules. Working mothers were more likely than working fathers to report having to reduce work hours to deal with household or family needs. And during the pandemic, women were twice as likely as men to say they had to juggle “a lot” of parenting duties while simultaneously teleworking. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Low-paid caregiving jobs bind together a lot of big trends happening in the economy, said Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. And you can see those themes play out in the lives of the women whose children used to ride to school on Roberta Steele’s bus — and now have no bus service at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Amanda Swanson, a neighbor of Kaidi’s, who spent the first months of school making a point of being first in the hour-long pickup line every day at Northport Elementary. She’s supporting her family working as a manager at an Amazon fulfillment center while her husband stays home with their youngest children because child care is too expensive. He used to be able to walk the children to the bus stop. But after the bus stopped running, Swanson switched to an overnight shift and frequently left her job early so she could drive them in the family’s only car. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" alt="Bus driver Roberta Steele waits for students" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Not long ago, Swanson (or her husband) would have been a prime candidate to <em>be</em> a school bus driver. Instead, she’s working a job that didn’t exist a decade ago but pays enough to keep her family solvent. It’s not just that school-support jobs don’t pay enough, it’s that they’re in direct competition for workers with jobs that pay more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At least since the 1970s, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wages for the majority of Americans have barely budged</a>, and if anything <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45090.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they've decreased for workers that don't have a college degree</a>,” said Krista Ruffini, a professor of economics at Georgetown University. Even before COVID-19, that squeeze is part of what has made jobs like bus driving less attractive today than they were 20 or 30 years ago, and it’s also put those jobs in competition with newer kinds of work — gig-economy jobs or delivery and warehouse jobs that require the same kinds of skills, pay the same or more, and require less emotional labor, Wozniak said. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="School bus drivers have other job options " aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SHk3V/13/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="410" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So far, these newer jobs are still a relatively small portion of all jobs and because of that probably can’t explain big, economy-wide trends. “But there will be some employers now who are competing with, basically, Amazon,” she said. A school bus driver could instead drive a delivery vehicle. School support staff like paraprofessionals and lunch ladies have logistics skills that are needed in a warehouse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when there’s a shortage of school bus drivers, that makes it hard for some parents to take a job. Once her children were finally old enough to be in school during the day, Kaidi had intended to go back to work this fall for the first time in years. But, she said, she’s received multiple job offers she couldn’t accept because of the time she has to spend ferrying her children to and from four different school buildings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Her conundrum makes it easy to understand how <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pandemic has disproportionately</a> affected <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/why-has-covid-19-been-especially-harmful-for-working-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women’s careers</a>. “On the female side of the labor market, we know that there's been an increase in people that say that they can't work because they're providing care,” Ruffini said. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some have had to quit</a>; others just don’t reenter the workforce, even when they have an opportunity. That’s been a feature of the pandemic, affecting a wide swath of the kinds of service and emotional-labor jobs that disproportionately employ women — jobs like the ones in schools. Kaidi’s experience shows how shortages in one field can create or exacerbate shortages in another. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, many of the women who have stayed in their emotional-labor jobs are being pushed to a breaking point — women like Swanson and Kaidi’s neighbor Christiana Metzger, a nursing assistant who works nights and has been running on almost no sleep since the beginning of the school year in September. She described breaking the speed limit, exhausted, trying to get home fast enough to take her older children to class on time, preparing meals and picking kids up from school and checking their homework, and the headache she’d had for several days straight. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The jobs done by people like Metzger are what middle-level jobs look like today, said Nicole Smith, chief economist at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Along with the lack of growth in real wages, there’s the idea that the job spectrum has hollowed out, leaving nothing but the worst-paying jobs and the ones that pay well but require college degrees. But that’s not exactly the case, Smith says. There are jobs left in the middle, but they’re no longer in manufacturing — they’re jobs that involve caring for people (like nurses) or supporting other workers (like school paraprofessionals). Again, women’s jobs. Jobs that continually conflict with women’s labor at home.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The emotional and psychological aspects of work are something economists are only just beginning to pay attention to, Wozniak said. But when shortages happen — whether through the cost-saving design of a lean staffing model or a chain of unfortunate events — it’s those intangible, immeasurable parts of a job that can quickly spiral out of control. “Now there are three people in the lunchroom instead of five or eight,” she said. “It’s the same job but not at all the same because you’re doing it faster and with less help.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bus driver shortage is a pay issue, but it’s also clearly more than that. It’s about how your job treats you. It’s about what you’re expected to do outside of the office. It’s about the narrow space women are squeezed into where we need to be better paid for the hard work we do at caregiving jobs but also need other women to do caregiving jobs at a lower price we can afford. It’s about being forced to make a choice between fulfilling your responsibilities at work and getting your children home safely. And it’s about how schools do, and don’t, function.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of October, Kaidi, Metzger and Swanson finally got bus service again. But they didn’t get it from Steele, who remains relegated to a different route, increasingly unhappy with the way the bus company and the district are treating her and other drivers. The immediate crisis ended for some of the moms of Brooklyn Center. But the problem isn’t solved. Not for the drivers. Not for the school districts suffering disruption on top of disruption. And not for the nation as a whole. “What’s going on in the labor market is something that we certainly haven’t seen in my lifetime,” Ruffini said. People have been out of work and out of their normal routines for a long time, she noted. Their responsibilities have changed at home. And so have the ways they spend their time and their resources. Nobody knows what happens next. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we do know that what happens with bus drivers is going to affect what happens with a lot of other people. The pandemic didn’t create these shortages. But it made clear how inextricably linked one job is to a whole bunch of others — how our lives and livelihoods are lashed together with cords we can’t usually see. When a time of stress and tragedy makes those invisible bonds more tangible, we can’t go back to pretending they don’t exist. All we can do is try to untangle them together. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">A sample size of two is never sufficient to get an accurate read of what’s happening in politics — let alone what <em>will</em> happen. But in the wake of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections last week</a>, that’s what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xSyf1wPN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everyone is trying to do</a>. Still, we’re almost exactly one year away from the 2022 midterm elections, so the temptation is understandable. So, what <em>can</em> last week’s results tell us about the 2022 midterm elections? And what <em>can’t</em> they tell us?</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Right </strong><strong><em>now</em></strong><strong>, the political environment is significantly more friendly to Republicans than it was in 2020</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the simplest, surest and maybe most important takeaway from the 2021 elections. As we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-virginias-and-new-jerseys-elections-could-suggest-a-red-wave-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last week</a>, the electorates in both states shifted toward the GOP, leading to only about a 3-percentage-point reelection victory for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in fairly blue New Jersey and a 2-point win for Republican Glenn Youngkin in comparably purple Virginia, which marked the first statewide win for the Virginia GOP since 2009. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having looked through the results, we can be really confident that Republicans have an edge right now. And keeping in mind the historical tendency of the party holding the White House to face substantial headwinds in the subsequent midterm election, there’s plenty to suggest that Republicans could have a turnout edge in 2022 as the nonpresidential party. Speaking of …</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Turnout is likely to be supercharged in 2022 — especially among Republicans</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last Tuesday’s vote demonstrated that Republicans are strongly motivated to turnout. We can see that in the chart below, where the greater the Republican vote share was in a county or city, the better turnout was compared to the 2020 election. While turnout fell everywhere from last November (you’d expect that going from a presidential contest — the highest-profile election in the U.S. — to an off-year election), participation tended to decline less in places that voted more Republican.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1142" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">History shows that this pattern is unsurprising considering there’s a Democratic president in office — and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular one at that</a>. All else being equal, we’d expect the average Republican to be more likely to show up right now than the average Democrat. This “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differential turnout</a>” will be an important factor in the 2022 midterms, although just how much of a turnout edge Republicans will end up having remains to be seen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the broader turnout picture also suggests that our era of high turnout elections seems likely to continue in 2022. Among the nation’s <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/faq/denominator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting-eligible population</a>, more Americans cast ballots in the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2018g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 midterms</a> (50 percent) and <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 presidential election</a> (67 percent) than in <a href="http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any midterm or presidential race</a> since the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting age was lowered</a> to 18 in 1971, according to the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Elections Project</a>. Yet while the 2017 elections in Virginia and New Jersey <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-it-time-for-republicans-to-panic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served as initial markers</a> of high voter engagement early in Donald Trump’s presidency, those contests actually had significantly lower turnout than what we saw this year. Compared with 2017, Virginia’s turnout jumped from about 43 percent to around 53 percent of the voting-eligible population, a modern record for the state, while New Jersey’s increased from around 36 percent to roughly 41 percent.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are estimates based on voting-eligible population data from the &lt;a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;United States Elections Project&lt;/a&gt;, which will not publish new population figures until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a> This doesn’t guarantee that 2022 turnout will outpace the 2018 midterms, but it does portend that participation levels will still be quite high compared with pre-2018 midterms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, the results in Virginia and New Jersey should put paid to the idea that high turnout is a panacea for Democrats. New Jersey and Virginia lean Democratic as a default: According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>, the Garden State is about 12 points more Democratic than the nation as a whole, while Virginia is D+5.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> As such, you might expect a higher turnout off-year election to come closer to falling in line with those partisan baselines. Yet with turnout up in both states from 2017, Republicans won in Virginia and fell just short in bluer New Jersey.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Democratic turnout may not be low in 2022, but matching Republicans will be tough</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, considering the high overall turnout, it’s apparent that Democrats also showed up at a relatively high rate in many places — just not quite to the same extent as Republicans. For instance, Fairfax County, Virginia’s most populous locality and one Biden <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51059&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried by 42 points</a> last year, saw its vote total decrease by about the same rate as raw turnout fell in Virginia overall from 2020 (down about 27 percent). But looking ahead to 2022, turnout figures carried warning signs regarding two groups who usually lean pretty strongly toward the Democrats: voters of color and young people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it came to turnout and race in last Tuesday’s elections, places that were whiter tended to see higher turnout compared with the 2020 presidential race. For instance, in the cities and counties in New Jersey and Virginia that are majority nonwhite, turnout from 2020 fell by 39 percent, compared with a decline of 29 percent in places that were 80 percent white or more. Of course, given the swing toward the GOP in the 2021 elections and the tendency for more Republican-leaning places to see higher turnout, this isn’t surprising. After all, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/american-politics-now-has-two-big-racial-divides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race is one of the strongest predictors of partisan identity</a> — nationally, fewer than 1 in 5 Republicans are nonwhite, while about 2 in 5 Democrats are, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a 2019 Pew Research</a> study — so if GOP turnout was higher, we’d expect greater participation in whiter areas.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, we see evidence that fewer young voters showed up to vote. Turnout dropped precipitously in college towns. Radford and Harrisonburg, small cities in western Virginia with sizable state universities,<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radford University and James Madison University, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> for instance, saw the ninth- and 10th-largest drops in turnout from 2020 across all 133 Virginia cities and counties. And while exit polls are imperfect, 18 to 29-year-olds made up <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2021/november/exit-polls/virginia/governor/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 10 percent of the electorate</a> in Virginia’s exit polls, a decline <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from their share in 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2017-election/va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely compared with 2017 as well</a>, both comparatively more Democratic environments than the current one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With all this being said, a disproportionate dropoff in turnout among voters of color and young voters in nonpresidential elections isn’t unusual. In midterm elections, the electorate has traditionally been whiter and older because a disproportionate number of voters who are young and/or from racial or ethnic minorities <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/how-midterms-do-and-do-not-differ-from-presidential-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to drop out of the electorate</a>. But because Democrats are more reliant on these voters as whites without a college degree — the largest part of the electorate — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-voters-without-a-degree-remained-staunchly-republican-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move toward the GOP</a>, it’s become more critical for Democrats to find ways to ameliorate this midterm turnout decline.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN’T: The 2021 elections signal a GOP swing in 2022 — but not how much of one</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">For all the strong reactions to the New Jersey and Virginia results, however, it’s worth pointing out that it’s entirely normal for those two states to swing away from the president’s party — hell, it would have been strange if they <em>hadn’t</em>. In all but one of the two states’ 16 total gubernatorial elections since 1993, the party in the White House has performed worse than it did the year before in the presidential election. The one exception wasn’t exactly a dramatic one either, as the GOP lost the 2001 New Jersey governor’s race by about 15 points one year after losing by 16 points in the 2000 presidential contest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Virginia is a more competitive state at its baseline and has more regularly moved away from the president’s party, so observers tend to look at it as a potential indicator of <a href="https://twitter.com/algaraca/status/1455934093422702600?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future midterm results</a>. But for all the focus on Virginia, since the early 1990s it’s been an inconsistent predictor of the next midterm result. From 1993 to 2018, the average difference between the swing in Virginia’s gubernatorial election from the state’s partisan lean and the margin in the midterm national popular vote for the House of Representatives was just shy of 7 percentage points. That error margin — and remember, our sample of elections here is relatively small; there could be an even bigger difference in 2022 — represents the difference between a “meh” or even OK year for Democrats in 2022 and a complete wipeout in both the House and the Senate. </p>

 <p>FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, the Virginia result can’t tell us exactly what the national House vote is going to look like next year. It gives us only a <em>rough</em> idea of how the political winds might blow as we head into the midterm year.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between that swing and the House vote margin since 1993 is .56, which suggests there’s a somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-interpret-a-correlation-coefficient-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;positive relationship&lt;/a&gt; between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That makes sense, as the factors that boosted Republicans in 2021, especially <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s poor approval rating</a>, could push voters toward them next year, too. Indeed, the scope of that rightward swing will depend greatly on Biden’s standing — if it improves between now and next fall, that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could fend off some of the Democrats’ potential losses</a>; if it stays where it is or gets worse, Democrats could be looking at another 1994 or 2010, when their party took a thorough shellacking in the House and Senate.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN’T: How coalitions will shift in 2022</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another thing the Virginia and New Jersey races can’t tell us with certainty is just which parts of the two parties’ coalitions are actually sticking with them or shifting disproportionately toward the other party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, might white voters with a college degree stick with Democrats? The exit polls from Virginia suggest Democrats won a narrow majority among them, more or less the same as Biden performed in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit polls are always at least a little bit prone to error — they are still surveys, after all — but this was &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;especially true in the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; given how much of the electorate voted absentee. It’s likely this comparison isn’t apples-to-apples but it’s still a useful benchmark for understanding the shift among suburban voters in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a> So it’s possible this group, which <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has trended toward Democrats</a> in recent years, will hold up for the party come 2022. At the same time, an analysis of county-level data in the Virginia and New Jersey races didn’t show much of a relationship between how much Republicans improved over their 2020 showing in a place and how much of the population is white with a college degree. In other words, if Democrats’s support among white voters with a college degree held steady, we might have expected those sorts of places to see comparatively smaller Republican gains, but instead there wasn’t much of a pattern in the data to suggest that happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And for all the talk of Democratic losses in the suburbs and rural areas, it’s worth noting that there was a relatively uniform swing toward the GOP across rural, suburban and more urban parts of both New Jersey and Virginia. Using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index is a measure of how densely populated a county or county-equivalent is based on the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> we categorized localities in both states into places that are more urban, suburban/exurban, or rural in nature, and found that while suburban and exurban places tended to move the most toward Republicans, the magnitude of those shifts were not all that different from urban and rural areas.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We categorized places with an index of 12 or more as urban, 10 to 12 as suburban or exurban, and below 10 as rural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

 <p>FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index, a calculation of how urban or rural a county is, is the natural logarithm of the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract in that county. Places with an index of 12 or more were categorized as urban, 10 to 12 as suburban or exurban, and below 10 as rural.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps if suburban areas had shifted even more markedly to the right while more urban places stayed in the Democratic camp, we could more convincingly claim that the suburbs in particular swung hard for the GOP. Or if rural areas had moved further to the right than other types of places, we could better make the case that it was rural areas that cost Democrats in Virginia. But the lack of more sizable variations across types of place leaves us with a less obvious conclusion about the role of population density, at least beyond “the environment was good for Republicans.” Although, obviously, if the swings are like this in November 2022, that’ll be all the GOP needs to capture the House and Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, we got little clarity on whether Hispanics continued to notably shift toward the GOP after moving to the right in 2020. The exit polls found that Democrat Terry McAuliffe won about two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, which didn’t differ that much from Biden’s showing in 2020. However, the <a href="https://interactives.ap.org/votecast-2021-va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press’s VoteCast</a> caused a stir when it reported that Youngkin had actually carried Latino voters. The truth might lie somewhere in between, but fundamentally, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US,VA/PST045219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only about 10 percent of Virginia’s population</a> is Hispanic, so we also know the sample sizes of <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_m_rob/status/1456014764103065600?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanics were not especially large in either survey</a>, which produces results that have a larger margin of error. And just to add to the confusion, consider some of the actual vote totals. On the one hand, after taking into account the overall swing toward the GOP, McAuliffe didn’t do exceedingly worse than previous Democratic statewide candidates in a handful of majority Hispanic precincts in <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/the-future-of-vote-tabulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairfax County</a>, and the only place where Murphy more or less matched Biden’s margin was Hudson County (Jersey City), which is 40 percent Hispanic. At the same time, Murphy lost about the same amount of margin in Passaic County, which is 42 percent Hispanic, as he did statewide compared to Biden (14.5 points vs. about 13 points). There’s just not a clear picture.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The results out of New Jersey and Virginia signal that the electoral environment is clearly favorable to Republicans right now, although it can’t tell us just how pro-GOP it’ll be in a year’s time. There’s little question that Republican voters are energized and motivated to turn out to a greater extent than Democratic ones, and Democrats do have to worry about turning out important parts of their base, like young voters and voters of color. But the New Jersey and Virginia contests failed to really tell us just how certain demographic groups might vote next year, or whether they’re continuing to trend toward or away from either party. Part of that is down to having just two major elections to go off of. But it’s also down to a mixed bag of data that offers somewhat contradictory conclusions.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Can white voters who back a Black candidate still hold racist beliefs and views?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That question has come to the fore in the wake of Glenn Youngkin’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gubernatorial victory in the blueish state of Virginia</a>. Conservatives were quick to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/progressives-cry-racism-to-excuse-democratic-losses-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter claims</a> that Youngkin’s win <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/republicans-critical-race-theory-winning-electoral-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented the effectiveness of stoking racial fears</a> with results from Virginia’s down-ballot election for lieutenant governor — a contest where the Republican candidate, Winsome Sears, made history by becoming the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia. The Wall Street Journal’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/virginia-governor-election-glenn-youngkin-race-11635979212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editorial board</a>, for example, emphatically mocked the notion that “voters called white supremacists elected a Black Lt. Gov.” Conservative commentators on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-five-media-glenn-youngkin-winsome-sears-virginia-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News and Twitter</a>, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jemele-hill-roasted-for-tweet-alleging-this-country-simply-loves-white-supremacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sears herself</a>, also used the historic victory as an ostensible shield against accusations of Republican racism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But supporting a Black candidate hardly precludes voters from harboring racist beliefs and motivations. Republicans are <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196435/identity-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly more likely than Democrats</a> to hold prejudiced views of minorities, so Black Republicans like Sears often draw especially strong support from white Americans with otherwise anti-Black views simply because they draw most of their support from Republican voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A clear example of this was in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, when Ben Carson made a bid to become the GOP’s first African American presidential nominee. Support for Carson was positively correlated with the belief that Black Americans have too much influence on U.S. politics, according to data from <a href="https://wc.wustl.edu/taps-data-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington University in St. Louis’s American Panel Survey (TAPS)</a> in late 2015:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1194" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Whites who thought African Americans had “far too little” influence disliked Carson and preferred Hillary Clinton by 60 percentage points in a hypothetical general election matchup. Meanwhile, Carson was very popular among whites who were most concerned about African Americans having “too much” influence in politics. So much so that whites who thought African Americans have “far too much” influence preferred Carson to Clinton by 45 points.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, much of that relationship is down to partisanship — Republicans are more likely to hold prejudiced views and also more likely to support a Republican candidate. But that’s the point: For many white GOP voters, anti-Black views don’t seem to get in the way of supporting a Black Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can see a similar pattern in the January <a href="https://electionstudies.org/data-center/anes-2016-pilot-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 American National Election Studies Pilot Study</a>. Carson received more favorable evaluations among the sizable minority (40 percent) of overtly prejudiced whites who agreed with the racist stereotype that “most African Americans are more violent than most whites.” This group rated Carson significantly more favorably on a 0-100 scale than the white moderate Republican presidential candidate, Jeb Bush (52 to 39, respectively). Then-candidate Donald Trump was the only politician in the survey who was rated higher than Carson among overtly prejudiced whites.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicians evaluated in the 2016 ANES Pilot Study were: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a>                </p>

The sharp negative relationship between support for Obama and the endorsement of anti-Black stereotypes is consistent with <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300175196/end-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo10443910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/s0022381612000904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00564.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9108-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prejudice</a> was an <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41319767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusually strong</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272714000929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictor</a> of opposition to Obama from the 2008 election <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the end of his presidency</a>.

<p data-paragraph="main">To make sense of why racially prejudiced white Americans are willing to support some Black candidates, it is worth considering why they so strongly oppose Black Democrats in the first place. Given the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691153889/racial-realignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racialized nature of the two-party system</a> in the United States, most Black political candidates are Democrats who embrace liberal positions on issues of race and justice. When asked whether they would support such a candidate, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/voting-hopes-or-fears-9780195101621?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows</a> that racially prejudiced white voters worry that these candidates will represent the interests of Black Americans, both because of a shared African American identity  and because Democrats are <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196435/identity-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived as the party more supportive of Black interests</a>. So, it makes sense that racially resentful white Americans oppose candidates like Obama, as his racial identity <em>and</em> partisanship signaled to voters that he was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more supportive of Black interests</a> than prior presidents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put another way: Racially prejudiced white voters are not opposed to Black candidates simply because they are Black, but because they believe that most Black candidates will fight for “those people” and not “people like us.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black Republicans, on the other hand, are <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/70/2/139/1912448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived differently</a> by racially prejudiced white Americans. Their embrace of the Republican Party and its conservative ideology help assure racially prejudiced whites that, unlike Black Democrats, they are not in the business of carrying water for their own racial group. Instead, they are viewed as distinct from other Black elites. If Blackness is viewed as intertwined with a kind of racial liberalism that is antagonistic to the interests of white Americans, Black Republicans’ partisan and ideological commitments allay concerns that they are for “them,” not “us.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This argument is buttressed by more <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/708952?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent scholarship</a> in political science, which has found that Black candidates who embrace a “bootstrap” ideology — an ideology that focuses on individual versus structural explanations of inequality — are more positively evaluated by racially prejudiced whites relative to their white competitors. Explaining this finding, the authors note that racially prejudiced white voters “might find black Republicans delivering an individualism message more favorable than they might find other candidates delivering a similar message precisely because the aesthetic character and the partisan affiliation of the messenger contradict racial and political expectations.” LaFleur Stephens-Dougan, a professor of political science at Princeton University, similarly shows in her book “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo50271574.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Race to the Bottom</a>” that racially resentful whites respond well to Black candidates who take stances against the expected positions of their racial group — a phenomenon she calls “<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/11/how-politicians-practice-racial-distancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial distancing</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, voting for Black Republicans may also be especially appealing to racially prejudiced whites because it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-politics-of-white-liberals-and-white-conservatives-are-shaped-by-whiteness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assuages concerns of being seen as racist</a> by enabling them to say, in essence, “I can’t be racist! I voted for a Black candidate!” Psychologists call this “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167210385920?casa_token=ZYs_NQsQ6UUAAAAA:cYTNozXMv1BaxUXXgOFltZuDZbaMbQDoQ45nK4DO8O1RR3iuzEtNjEBlTDK5SI9Ztd7x9JYXZFKsjg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moral credentialing</a>,” and there’s even <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/march4/obama-moral-credentials-favor-whites-030409.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> that voters who expressed support for Obama shortly after the 2008 election felt more justified in favoring white Americans over Black Americans. Electing a Black Republican like Sears, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/virginia-republican-winsome-sears-critical-race-theory-nonsense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">railed against critical race theory</a> during the run-up to the election and <a href="https://twitter.com/winsomesears/status/1372941065007816705?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports voting restrictions</a> that <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voter-suppression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adversely affect racial minorities</a>, is similarly used as a symbolic shield by the entire party from inevitable charges of championing racist policies. As we mentioned earlier, conservative media outlets and politicians are already weaponizing her victory against anyone who would dare suggest so.    </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, the role race and racism play in American politics is much more nuanced than those simplistic defenses suggest. When racially prejudiced whites oppose Black candidates, it’s not just because of the candidate’s skin color. It’s also because they perceive (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3791741.pdf?casa_token=uYKOesmYykcAAAAA:d-YnnVbpIrcuvW4LXifNINvlzmidnOyOxQTynx6PA_gCzCM6mTgTsKU5yeFrYkwWdm1L-cw0WCe0ZpC-6v1hvBAvigo5Du16GgvF0TcyZevRA9wrRw_C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes wrongly</a>) that Black candidates, especially Black Democrats, have ideological commitments that are at odds with the interests of white Americans. Likewise, when racially prejudiced whites support Black Republicans, it’s hardly the case that they’ve become progressive on race. Racially prejudiced whites did not vote for Sears because they appreciated her attachment and commitment to Black people. They were willing to support her because they discounted it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Race, after all, is a social construct. It has meaning because we imbue it with meaning. Racially prejudiced whites are not hostile to Blackness, per se. They are hostile to a particular manifestation of Blackness — one that reflects a commitment to racial justice and the advancement of the group’s collective goals. Racially prejudiced whites are not bothered much by a manifestation of Blackness that is ideologically consistent with their own identities and attitudes. Why would they be? Sears’s conservative politics don’t threaten the racial hierarchy, and her candidacy provides cover for a party that’s often antagonistic to racial minorities. For racially prejudiced whites, the real question is what is there <em>not</em> to love about Black politicians like Sears?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">After an excruciating wait for many families, children ages 5 and older can now be vaccinated against COVID-19. The decision marks a turning point in the pandemic for millions of Americans as they can worry a little less and live a little more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For more than a year and a half we’ve been told that the worries of adults have changed the lives of kids in all sorts of deleterious ways. And so, on the eve of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s decision to approve vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds, we wanted to know just how kids (and their parents) were doing. Are kids and teenagers stressed, depressed and scared? How do they see themselves and their families changed by the pandemic? And how has their behavior changed to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in their daily life? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To help answer those questions, we partnered with <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our friends at Ipsos</a>, the polling firm, to work on a poll that asked parents and kids how they’re doing. Between Oct. 25 and Nov. 2, FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos used Ipsos’ KnowledgePanel to survey 689 kids ages 5 to 11, 572 kids ages 12 to 17 (let’s call them “teens” for our purposes), and more than 1,500 of their parents.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We began by surveying a representative sample of parents with children under 18 in the household. After they completed the survey, we randomly selected a child 5 to 17 (if applicable) and asked if their selected child was available and would consent to take a short survey. For the 5- to 11-year-olds, we directed the parent to ask the child the questions and record the answers. For the 12- to 17-year-olds, we asked the parent to have the teen complete the survey. Parents and kids alike could take the survey on a computer, tablet or mobile phone, in English or in Spanish. Each surveyed population (adults, teens and children) received its own weighting, based on benchmarks from the 2019 American Community Survey and 2021 March Supplement of the Current Population Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> The answers were surprising! We found a population of kids who appear to be pretty resilient, even in the face of loneliness and isolation, and who are forming strong relationships with their parents and families. Any one kid who’s struggling because of the pandemic is a source of concern. Overall, though, America’s kids aren’t as downtrodden as they’re often made out to be. </p>

These were our highlights:</p>



<h2><strong><strong>Parents are concerned about their kids, but kids are having a pretty good time</strong></strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The kids are all right — or, at least, they report being a lot more all right than we were expecting. The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed the lives of children and teens, cutting them off from friends, activities and adults other than their parents. The combination of limited social contact, disrupted schooling and fear of the virus itself <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-04/childrens-mental-health-crisis-could-be-a-next-wave-in-the-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led many to anticipate</a> a major mental health crisis looming in youth. A poll conducted this past spring by the Children’s Hospital of Chicago found <a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/blog/childrens-mental-health-pandemic-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65 percent of parents believed the mental health consequences for kids will be worse</a> than for adults. So we were surprised to find that the kids who participated in our survey almost universally don’t describe themselves as struggling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, we asked teens, ages 12 to 17, about the current state of their mental health and a vast majority had good things to say.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, their parents were a little more likely to report poor mental health — 11 percent of parents to 8 percent of the teens. FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos asked kids aged 5 to 11 a slightly different question — “How do you feel right now?” — and 96 percent of them said they felt very or somewhat good. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That’s great. It’s really good news,” said Anna Gassman-Pines, a professor of psychology and public policy at Duke University, when we told her the results of the survey. “There’s a lot of good developmental science behind the idea that ultimately kids will be resilient.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good vibes extended to more specific parts of their lives, too. Overall, teens were less likely than their parents to be worried about their ability to perform in school, less worried about their ability to participate in activities, less worried about catching COVID-19, and much less worried about their mental health. While 34 percent of parents were concerned about their kids’ mental health, about half as many teens — 18 percent — found their own mental health concerning. More than half said their mental health hadn’t changed at all since the start of the pandemic — 24 percent said it had gotten worse and 20 percent said their mental health was now better. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="814" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1290798708-575.jpg" alt="High School basketball cheerleaders in the stands wearing masks." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1290798708-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1290798708-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1290798708-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Most kids reported they’re still playing outside with each other, but less than half of kids are attending club meetings or playing sports inside. <p>Ben Hasty / MediaNews Group / Reading Eagle via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, while parents were busy worrying, teens were reporting … having a good time with them. Twenty-seven percent of teens reported that the pandemic led to improvements in their home lives and 30 percent reported having better relationships with their parent(s). And more than 90 percent of kids of all ages felt that their parents had done a good job keeping them safe during the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gassman-Pines’s <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/display/pub1454300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own research has focused on the impacts COVID-19 had on low-income families</a>, and particularly the families of people who worked in the service industry during the pandemic. She was pleasantly surprised to find that the good news remained largely good even when we broke our respondents down by income and race. There were some differences, though. Black parents were more likely than white parents to report that they were concerned about their personal finances, and low-income parents reported worse finances and physical health than higher-income parents. And teens and children of color were more scared of COVID-19 and of being lonely. But the shares of teens who felt good about their home lives, relationship with parents, mental and physical health, and current loneliness were mostly consistent across race and income.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey asked respondents about race and ethnicity, so white includes only non-Hispanic white respondents, and Black non-Hispanic Black respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> Even when parents were having a harder time, and kids were more worried, the outcomes for those kids weren’t particularly worse. It’s possible, Gassman-Pines said, that this is an indicator of the positive, stabilizing impacts of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/politics/stimulus-checks-economic-hardship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimulus</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/28/child-tax-credit-permanent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">child tax credit</a> payments — something that’s been observed in other research.  </p>



<h2><strong>Kids<strong> say they’re living in a world trying to keep them safe from COVID-19</strong></strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">We were also surprised to see high rates of reported mask usage and other behaviors to keep people safe from COVID-19. Eighty percent of teens and younger kids reported that their teachers were consistently or always wearing masks at school, 70 percent of both groups reported that their friends were consistently doing the same, and more than 70 percent said other kids at school were. The kids and teens in our survey also reported that they, themselves, were mask wearing at rates higher than 70 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Predictably, there were geographic differences in this data. Teens in the Northeast were most likely to say their teachers always wear masks — more than 75 percent of them. Those rates were less than 50 percent in the Midwest and South. This tracks with regulations. Schools in the Northeast have been <a href="https://districtadministration.com/track-school-mask-rules-requirements-state-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to implement and maintain masking mandates</a> than schools in the South. Cases of COVID-19 in children have followed the same patterns, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographicsovertime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with higher rates in the Southeast and South</a> than in the Northeast. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="814" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There were also differences in behavior by race. White kids were more likely to report having indoor playdates in the last month — a particularly interesting result given that white kids were also the ones least likely to be worried about contracting COVID-19 themselves. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1062" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Kids’ relationships with their friends are relatively worse off</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">While kids and teens have generally positive things to report about their overall mental health and their relationships at home, the pandemic does seem to have had an impact on how young people interact with each other and how they feel about those changes. Indoor activities are still not the norm for most kids. Fewer than 50 percent of both teens and younger children had had an indoor playdate in the last month; fewer than 40 percent had attended an indoor party; and only 41 percent of teens and 31 percent of younger children had attended an indoor club meeting or played sports inside. In contrast, 64 percent of teens and 77 percent of younger kids had played with their friends outside, an activity that is significantly less likely to lead to COVID-19 transmission. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And we see some big contrasts in how kids and teens think about their friends versus their family. While 30 percent of teens reported improved relationships with parents since COVID-19 began and only 7 percent reported those relationships worsening, the changes in relationships with friends were a lot more split, with 27 percent reporting that their friendships and social lives had gotten better and 29 percent reporting they had gotten worse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, 26 percent of teens reported feeling less connected and more lonely since the start of the pandemic, while 25 percent reported feeling more connected and less lonely. While the raw numbers were small, we did see correlations that connected a strong sense of feeling lonely to a sense that one’s mental health had gotten worse. </p>



<h2>Families generally agree on vaccines</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Parents have spent a lot more time talking about the vaccine to other adults than teens have spent discussing it with their peers — 50 percent to 38 percent. But that doesn’t mean the teens haven’t formed opinions on the vaccine and how it should be rolled out. Those opinions tend to track with the opinions of their parents. For example, 60 percent of parents and 61 percent of teens agreed that schools should mandate vaccines for adults in schools, including teachers and administrators. And a smaller majority agreed that schools should mandate vaccines for students 12 and older: 54 percent of parents and 57 percent of teens. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">About 50 percent of parents in the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll were interested in vaccinating their under-12 children, depending on the age of the child, and between 50 and 60 percent of the teens we interviewed had already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. (The survey was conducted before the CDC approved vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds.) </p>

If you focus just on teens whose parents had already gotten vaccinated or were very likely to, 79 percent of them said they were already vaccinated or were very likely to be soon — compared to just 9 percent of teens whose parents weren’t vaccinated and weren’t likely to be. We found similar patterns with younger kids: 46 percent of those whose parents were vaccinated said they were (or were going to be soon), compared to just 1 percent of kids whose parents weren’t vaccinated and weren’t likely to be. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Teens’ and kids’ attitudes about whether they should get the vaccine themselves were also highly correlated with parents’ attitudes. Among teens and kids who were unlikely to get vaccinated, parent opinions mattered significantly more than whether peers were getting vaccinated or not. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, to summarize, kids are relatively happy and listening to their parents. Just as we always assumed. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">After considering at least 11 proposals, the North Carolina General Assembly finally <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/politics/2021/11/04/redistricting-in-n-c---new-maps-approved--favoring-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a new congressional map</a> on Nov. 4 — and it’s one of the most Republican-biased maps they could have chosen. But this likely isn’t the end of the redistricting saga in the Tar Heel State. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting is usually a once-a-decade process, but in North Carolina, courts have repeatedly ordered the drawing of new congressional maps due to extreme gerrymandering. And given that both racial and partisan gerrymandering <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article255621116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits have already been filed</a> against this new map, it remains to be seen whether it will survive either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Carolina’s previous congressional map — which is to say, the one used in last year’s election — already gave <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/north-carolinas-new-house-map-hands-democrats-two-seats-but-it-still-leans-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans eight seats and Democrats five seats</a> in a state President Biden lost by just 1 percentage point, but the new map gives the GOP an even greater advantage. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our analysis</a>, it creates 10 Republican seats, three Democratic seats and one highly competitive seat.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1796" height="1248" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The approved map has an efficiency gap of R+20.1, up 11.6 points from the old map, which had an efficiency gap of R+8.5. (<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Efficiency gap</a> is a measure of which party has more “wasted” votes, i.e., votes that don’t contribute toward a candidate winning. This means that the new map is more than twice as efficient for Republicans as the old map, which was already pretty efficient for them.) Under the new map, North Carolina’s median congressional district is also now 11.4 points redder than the state as a whole. In other words, Democrats would have to win North Carolina by 11.4 points just to win half its congressional seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The new map boosts Republicans in the state through reapportionment, both by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving the state a 14th district, which the Republican-majority General Assembly used to give their party a double-digit advantage,</a> and by making two currently Democratic-held seats much less blue. One of those seats is the 6th District, which previously encompassed all of Guilford County and part of Forsyth County. The new map splits the old 6th into four districts, which contradicts House Redistricting Committee Chair Destin Hall’s <a href="https://repdestinhall.com/2021/11/04/north-carolina-house-passes-2021-redistricting-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> that the committee “focused only on traditional criteria like keeping counties and cities whole” when drawing maps. This change will surely make for an improbable reelection for Democratic Rep. Kathy Manning. In the new map, Manning represents the new 11th District, which leans Republican by 16 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other Democratic seat the new map undermines is Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield’s 1st District, which is now numbered the 2nd District in the approved map. Butterfield’s district goes from leaning Democratic by 7 points to leaning Democratic by just 1 point.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t the first time North Carolina has drawn maps that favor one group over others. During the 2010s, the state had two maps thrown out in court due to racial and partisan gerrymandering. Following the initial map in 2011, the courts ruled in 2016 that the state’s map had been racially gerrymandered to disadvantage Black voters in the state, a decision that was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upheld by the Supreme Court</a>. Then, in 2019, a state court panel threw out North Carolina’s 2016 map because it was ruled <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/north-carolina-judges-toss-maps-slam-gerrymandering-stinging-ruling-n1049411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partisan gerrymander</a> that gave Republicans an advantage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This time around, likely in an attempt to <a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2021-08-12/nc-lawmakers-adopt-criteria-for-next-round-of-redistricting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insulate themselves from more gerrymandering lawsuits</a>, legislative map-drawers <a href="https://ncleg.gov/documentsites/committees/Senate2021-154/2021/08-09-2021/2021%20Joint%20Redistricting%20Committee%20Plan%20Proposed%20Criteria.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced their redistricting criteria</a> in advance, which included adhering to the 2019 court’s decree that they not use partisan or racial data when crafting the new maps. But as we’ve seen, the 2021 congressional map gives Republicans an even greater advantage than before. And by omitting racial data, lawmakers may be running afoul of the <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/what-is-redistricting/redistricting-criteria-the-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voting Rights Act</a>, which requires states to draw heavily nonwhite districts in areas where there is racially polarized voting so that those communities have a voice in Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Specifically, the new map could imperil the ability of Black residents in the new 2nd District (Butterfield’s district) to elect the representative of their choice. The new district has a voting-age population that is just 38 percent Black — down from 41 percent under the old map. It’s also 51 percent white, which is up from 48 percent. While this may appear to be a small difference, it’s enough to change the district from one that would likely elect a Democrat to one that could easily elect a Republican instead. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Legal challenges to the state’s new map have already begun. Considering the partisan skew of the map and its possible Voting Rights Act violations, the 2021 map could join last decade’s maps and get thrown out by the courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before the map was approved, the North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause and state residents <a href="https://southerncoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NC-NAACP-v.-Berger-Complaint-10.29.2021-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> arguing that the new map disenfranchises voters of color precisely <em>because</em> lawmakers decided not to consider racial data when drawing it. The lawsuit argues that the legislature must consider racial data to ensure that voters of color can elect their candidate of choice. For their part, Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article255621116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say there is a precedent for not using racial data</a>: The 2019 map was approved without using it.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/exit-polls-explain-voters-vote-81047251</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The map also <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e909f4422f7a40a188de597/t/61859e7b8789a02515e620e2/1636146812238/2021.11.05+Supplemental+Complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces a lawsuit</a> on the grounds that it is a partisan gerrymander. The suit’s plaintiffs, who have regularly voted for Democrats, argue that the new map packs Democrats into districts like the Charlotte-area 9th District (to waste as many Democratic votes as possible) and cracks other Democratic strongholds like the Piedmont Triad (Manning’s current district) to minimize their voting power. Although <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/731847977/supreme-court-rules-partisan-gerrymandering-is-beyond-the-reach-of-federal-court?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court has ruled</a> (in a case concerning North Carolina) that partisan gerrymandering is a political question <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside the purview of federal courts</a>, this lawsuit will be decided by state courts, many of which have not been shy about striking down maps for reasons of partisan gerrymandering — including in North Carolina in 2019. And since Democrats currently hold a 4-3 majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court, this lawsuit may find a receptive audience.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It remains to be seen if the courts will overturn North Carolina’s new map, but the legal fight over them could further erode North Carolinians’ trust in the redistricting process. Both in the Tar Heel State and nationwide, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-trust-their-congressional-maps-to-be-drawn-fairly-can-anything-change-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters view gerrymandering as a serious problem</a> and are skeptical that their maps will be fair due to the partisan nature of the process. Based on North Carolina’s new map, that skepticism appears well-founded.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nearly a week after Virginia’s and New Jersey’s elections, Democrats are still debating what went wrong for them. Pundits have given lots of hot takes on why Democrats did so poorly and what it portends for the 2022 midterms. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politics podcast</a>, the FiveThirtyEight crew runs down a list of theories in a game of Buy, Sell or Hold to discuss what evidence, if any, supports some of these arguments. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also debate how reliable exit polls are in determining what motivates voters and consider how Democrats were able to overcome intraparty disagreements to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/us/politics/infrastructure-black-caucus-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In a break with Virginia’s recent electoral history, Republican Glenn Youngkin bested Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the state’s highly contentious governor’s race on Tuesday. Polls going into election night <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the two neck-and-neck</a>, but given McAuliffe had led the race until about a week before the election, it was still largely viewed as McAuliffe’s to lose — especially since Virginia Republicans had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/us/elections/youngkin-wins-virginia-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not won a statewide race since 2009</a> and Biden carried the state by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 percentage points last year</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So who powered Youngkin’s win? Well, he overperformed across the state, but exit polling data shows he did especially well among certain voting blocs — like white voters (both men and women) and voters without a college degree — which gave his campaign a boost. But one of the biggest factors for Youngkin might have been his strong showing among suburban voters. According to exit poll data, Youngkin won 53 percent of these voters across the state, which is roughly the opposite of what happened in 2020, when exit polls suggest President Joe Biden carried voters in those areas with a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrat-mcauliffe-facing-52-unfavorable-numbers-va-governor/story?id=80935662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar share of the vote</a>.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit polls are always at least a little bit prone to error &amp;#8212; they are still surveys, after all &amp;#8212; but this was &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;especially true in the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; given how much of the electorate voted absentee. It’s likely this comparison isn’t apples-to-apples but it’s still a useful benchmark for understanding the shift among suburban voters in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, we identified three main throughlines that we think are useful at this stage when discussing Youngkin’s upset: </p>



<ul><li>First and foremost, this is a story about suburban voters, who, on average, moved to the right. That is, as we suggested, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/">a departure from what we observed nationally</a> in the 2020 presidential election.</li><li>Education issues that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/11/03/school-board-races-show-mixed-results-critical-race-theory/6271364001/">dominated much</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/politics-policy/irony-ban-beloved-virginia-can-found-pages-book-rcna4081">of the lead-up to</a> Tuesday’s race were significant for understanding how voters felt about the candidates, but it’s actually really hard to isolate the role education played in the race.</li><li>Rather, disappointment in — or opposition to — Biden’s presidency may have been the main driver of this outcome, as is often the case in off-year Virginia elections.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s assess these one at a time: For starters, we (Geoffrey) <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote earlier this week</a> that the big reason Youngkin was successful was his strength in the suburban areas of the state where former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/trump-broke-suburbs-gop-virginia-516412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously struggled</a>. That’s especially true in Loudoun County, one of the most populous suburban enclaves in the commonwealth. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Virginia's suburbs swung towards Youngkin" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Skxj/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="478" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In Loudoun, McAuliffe underperformed relative to his party’s performance in 2020 while Youngkin overperformed: Although McAuliffe carried the county by 11 points, that marked a huge departure from Biden’s 25-point edge there last year. But Youngkin’s improved showing came across much of northern Virginia near Washington, D.C. (including Loudoun) as well as in predominantly suburban and exurban localities like Virginia Beach and Chesapeake in the southeastern corner of the state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In unpacking <em>why</em> Youngkin made inroads in the suburbs, though, things get more challenging. From the beginning, Youngkin straddled being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/trump-republican-governor-race-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-Trump but not so Trumpy</a> that he repelled suburban voters and white women (groups Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/upshot/election-polling-trump-women.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famously struggled with</a>). And because much of the previous suburban shift toward Democrats appears to have been driven by disdain for Trump, it’s now unclear that these gains will hold when Trump is off the ballot. It didn’t hurt that Youngkin, clad in a fleece vest most of the campaign, was able to posit himself as the spitting image of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/elections/glenn-youngkin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genial suburban dad</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, though, it doesn’t look like white college-educated voters, often <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/27/895867508/2020-suburban-voters-who-are-they" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately associated with the suburbs</a>, necessarily drove Youngkin’s victory. The polarization of white voters by educational attainment <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been a developing trend</a> in recent years, and the Virginia result shows an even more substantial split, thanks mainly to Youngkin gaining among white voters without a college degree. Remember, <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=&amp;t=Educational%20Attainment%3ARace%20and%20Ethnicity&amp;g=0400000US51%240500000&amp;y=2019&amp;tid=ACSDT1Y2019.B15002H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of white voters</a> without a four-year degree live in suburban places, too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, McAuliffe still narrowly edged Youngkin among white voters with a college degree; in fact, his margin <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t much different from Biden’s</a> in Virginia last November. By contrast, there wasn’t really much indication of an education gap among voters of color. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, while education-related issues — whether it was critical race theory or related to the pandemic — did seem to have had some effect on Tuesday’s results, it doesn’t seem like they alone influenced voters enough to push Youngkin over the edge. That doesn’t mean Youngkin didn’t make a concerted effort to appeal to parents, though. Throughout his campaign, he made subtle and not-so-subtle <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/virginia-governor-youngkin-education-gop-516625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeals to them by preying on fears</a> around things like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/us/politics/beloved-toni-morrison-virginia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taught in the classroom</a>. It wasn’t just the question of how race should be discussed in schools either. Youngkin also made appeals to parents fed up with more than a year of remote learning and other COVID-19-related school policies, like <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/who-is-glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-policies-beliefs/2866115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring masks in schools</a>. But all of this falls under the category of “education,” which makes it incredibly hard to disentangle which issue had a bigger impact on voters. And as we’ll discuss below, it’s not clear that education was even the most important factor for voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While roughly 59 percent of men with children under the age of 18 living in their home, for instance, supported Youngkin over McAuliffe, a majority of women with children (53 percent) backed McAuliffe. Similarly, a majority of men without children (56 percent) backed Youngkin, while women without children (54 percent) backed McAuliffe. In other words, men voted similarly regardless of their parental status, as did women.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these numbers could be explained in part by the simple fact that men tend to vote Republican, while women, on average, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to vote Democratic</a>. But the gender gap among parents here is notable because it makes it more difficult to pinpoint what education issues were the most salient to voters. Also, it’s possible that “nonparents,” by the exit poll’s definition, included a lot of younger and older voters who might have canceled each other out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if parental status wasn’t the most important thing in unpacking how voters voted on Tuesday, we shouldn’t discount the role education played in Tuesday’s race. Exit polling found that voters who believe parents should have “a lot” of say in what their child’s school teaches overwhelmingly supported Youngkin over McAuliffe (77 percent to 22 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other issues were also top of mind for voters, though. Polls ahead of Tuesday show that the <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginia-voters-economy-top-issue-when-voting-in-2021-election/65-29347cb5-a4b0-48bf-8c4b-180f4f33d48d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy topped voters’ list</a> of concerns. According to exit polling data, Youngkin won those voters, who were one-third of the respondents, with 55 percent of the vote compared to McAuliffe’s 44 percent. Youngkin also edged McAuliffe among the 8 percent of voters who named abortion as the top issue in the commonwealth: 58 percent to 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it really does seem like disappointment with Biden’s presidency is what ultimately drove support for Youngkin. Not only does <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-campaigns-virginia-election-2020-terry-mcauliffe-180e2815215619c97a931355f4cf6876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting already suggest</a> that some people who supported Biden last year <a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/11/03/republicans-bucked-virginias-blue-state-trend-here-are-a-few-reasons-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t vote in Virginia’s election</a>, but those who disapprove of Biden made up a majority of voters and voted overwhelmingly for Youngkin. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, 59 percent of voters who said they “somewhat” disapproved of the way Biden is handling his job as president and 96 percent who “strongly” disapproved backed Youngkin. Moreover, almost twice the share of people who had an unfavorable view of Trump backed Youngkin (17 percent) than the share who disapproved of Biden and backed McAuliffe (10 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, as with any election, it’s really hard to disentangle whether macro trends (Biden’s approval) versus local factors (education and the economy) had the biggest impact on the shifts toward the GOP. But they are related, and if Democrats want to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/joe-biden-plan-midterms-shellacking-458316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid a midterm shellacking</a> next year, they might want to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/opinion/virginia-election-democratic-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritize some of these</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/03/1051713890/election-analysis-virginia-new-jersey-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more local issues</a> that at least Virginians demonstrated could be important.</p>

Only one problem: Congress is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/house-reconciliation-package-explainer/index.html">still debating</a> what will be in the bill. On climate specifically, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html">a number of key provisions have already been cut</a>, with some items, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/democrats-update-reconciliation-bill-as-they-prepare-to-vote/">like a fee on methane emissions</a>, still being ironed out. But per a Morning Consult poll taken last month, voters have started to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/28/climate-politics-biden-approval/">doubt Biden’s ability</a> to deliver on his campaign promise of sweeping climate legislation.

This is understandable given that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-democrats-adding-paid-family-leave-back-social/story?id=80950206">what’s in the bill is still changing</a>, but almost half of respondents, 45 percent, said they weren’t following negotiations carefully. </li><li>Americans increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/#part3">don’t trust their own political institutions</a>, and on the world stage, some countries also don’t <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/01/what-people-around-the-world-like-and-dislike-about-american-society-and-politics/">think America is a great example of democracy</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-a-good-election-night-for-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great night for Republicans</a>. The GOP <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped the governor’s office in Virginia</a>, a race often seen as a bellwether for the following year’s midterm elections (though perhaps this is an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/#319479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overreaction</a>). But that wasn’t all. Even more impressively, Republicans came <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gov-phil-murphy-projected-winner-jersey-governors-race/story?id=80933002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarkably close to winning the New Jersey governor’s race</a>, which was not thought to be nearly as competitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 midterms, the better omen for the GOP might be how consistently they outperformed expectations across the board on Tuesday night. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans won not only the governorship in Virginia but also the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/politics/winsome-sears-virginia-lieutenant-governor-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lieutenant governor’s office</a> and <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2021/11/herring-concedes-to-miyares-in-virginia-attorney-general-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general’s office</a>. They appear to have gained one seat on net in the New Jersey state Senate and at least four (<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/dimaio-elected-assembly-minority-leader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perhaps as many as eight</a>) in the New Jersey General Assembly. And they won several down-ballot offices that hadn’t gotten as much attention, such as a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/spl/pennsylvania-supreme-court-candidates-2021-election-results-20211102.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Supreme Court seat</a> in Pennsylvania and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/republican-election-results-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">municipal offices</a> in New York. But the icing on the cake is that they took a majority in the <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/republicans-claim-house-majority-after-flipping-6th-seat/article_806a4149-8b34-5f6b-a908-032a70478aea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia House of Delegates</a>, putting them just one vote in the state Senate away from full control of state government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And these state-legislative elections arguably <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-virginia-mississippi-and-kentucky-can-tell-us-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have the most to tell us</a> about what the political environment will be in 2022. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve written previously</a>, special elections for both Congress and state legislatures can be quite predictive of the midterm elections they lead up to — as long as you consider them in aggregate and look at their margins of victory, not just who won.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, neither party has consistently punched above its weight in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional special elections held in 2021</a>. Perhaps this was, in part, because most special elections happened earlier in the year, when Biden was still popular. However, his approval ratings have since sunk (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 percent approval, 51 percent disapproval</a>),<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> and this week we got results from 100 Virginia House of Delegates elections and 40 New Jersey state Senate elections that took place under that anti-Democratic environment<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article won’t analyze the 40 elections for New Jersey General Assembly, the state’s lower chamber, that were also held on Tuesday. General Assembly districts elect two legislators each, and all candidates in the district run in the same race; the top two vote-getters are elected. This irregular arrangement makes Assembly races too different from typical elections to reliably analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> — and they exhibited a clear pattern of Republican overperformance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On average, the current<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> margins in those state-legislative races<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more specifically, those where both a Democrat and a Republican were active candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> are 7 percentage points better for Republicans than their districts’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan leans</a>.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> Specifically, Republicans overperformed by an average of 7 points in the Virginia House of Delegates:</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This overperformance was consistent — Republicans outran partisan lean in almost every district. It was also the biggest overperformance we’ve seen in the three times that we’ve done this analysis for odd-year legislative elections — although, in fairness, that’s still a pretty small sample size. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2017-elections-suggest-incumbency-wont-save-republicans-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2017</a>, Democrats overperformed in the Virginia House of Delegates by 2 points and in the New Jersey Senate by 5 points; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-virginia-mississippi-and-kentucky-can-tell-us-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a>, Democrats overperformed in the Virginia state Senate by 4 points and in the Virginia House by 3 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since partisan lean represents our best guess of how a district would vote in a neutral political environment, this implies that the nation currently leans toward Republicans by 6 or 7 points. If that holds true a year from now, the 2022 midterms would be a veritable red wave. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we don’t yet know the partisan leans of all the House districts that will be on the ballot next year, because most <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still haven’t been drawn</a>. But just for illustrative purposes, if Republicans won every district in the current House map<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e., the one used in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> that has a partisan lean redder than D+7, they would flip 47 seats en route to a 260-175 majority. And if every state with a partisan lean redder than D+7 votes Republican for Senate next year, the GOP would flip five seats: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado. (This obviously ignores other potentially important factors like candidate quality; it’s just meant as an illustration of how impressive Republicans’ performance was on Tuesday.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, this is probably the <em>worst-case</em> scenario for Democrats, just as this 7-point Republican overperformance in 2021 legislative elections is the worst for Democrats of the handful of midterm indicators we currently have at our disposal. The most obvious piece of counterevidence: Democrats still lead polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> by an average of 2.3 points.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if I were the Democratic Party, I’d be feeling less comforted by that number after Tuesday. While polls are usually in the right ballpark, they are still subject to a margin of error, as Democrats themselves discovered in 2020, when the generic-ballot polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overestimated their margin</a> by 4.2 points. Plus, there was already good reason to think that generic-ballot polls right now are overestimating Democrats: Almost all so far have surveyed registered voters rather than likely voters, who tend to be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Republican-leaning group</a>, especially in a midterm election when the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-republicans-really-have-a-big-turnout-advantage-in-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president is a Democrat</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nothing about 2022 is written in stone, and there’s no guarantee that a red-wave election will come to fruition. But the historical expectation with a Democratic president has always been that Republicans would have a good election cycle, and the evidence for that is mounting. The Republican overperformance in the 2021 elections is simply a reminder of how bad things could get for Democrats.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">This is a tale of two pastors and two mass shootings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a balmy June evening in 2015, a young man with a blunt bowl haircut walked into the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/south-carolina-mother-emanuel-ame-church.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in Charleston, South Carolina, to join a Wednesday night Bible study. As the worshipers closed their eyes in prayer, the man fired at least 70 shots, killing nine people. Among the dead were Ethel Lee Lance, the mother of the Rev. Sharon Risher, and two of Risher’s cousins.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two years later, on a bright Sunday morning in November, a man in a skull face mask fired some 700 rounds outside and inside the <a href="http://ssfb.net/site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs</a>, Texas, leaving at least 20 people injured and 26 dead. A pregnant woman, her unborn baby and the 14-year-old daughter of the church’s pastor, Frank Pomeroy, were among those killed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is also a tale of two very different responses to tragedy and trauma. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both pastors buried their dead, mourned their incalculable losses, read their Bibles, prayed and eventually returned to their ministries. But Risher, a nondenominational Christian pastor, dedicated herself to gun-law reform and reducing access to weapons. Pomeroy, a Southern Baptist, armed and trained his church members and routinely wears his weapon in the pulpit.</p>

Sharon Risher, flanked by Democratic senators at the U.S. Capitol, joins other survivors of gun violence to call for gun control. <p>Win McNamee / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“To me, being a follower of Jesus means that I will always advocate for nonviolence,” Risher told me from her home in Charlotte, North Carolina, just a few days after the sixth anniversary of her mother’s murder. “My thinking is, I don’t condemn anyone for owning a gun, but I want people to realize the power of the violence they hold in their hand when they have a gun. And that just because you have a right to own a gun does not mean you have to exercise the right to use it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pomeroy, who has a military background and grew up hunting, sees carrying a gun as an extension of his responsibility to protect his flock. He is both licensed and trained to use a handgun and often carried one before the shooting at his rural church.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“God has endowed some of us with the capability to be a warrior and others not,” he said, sitting at his dining room table during a video interview. “Some are on the frontline, and some are in the supply room. Both are equally important, but they’re gifted in different ways. And that’s why it’s important that we go to the Lord and seek what we’re supposed to do individually. And then if he says, yes, carry that firearm, I have no problem carrying that firearm.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg" alt="Pastor Frank Pomeroy" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who wears a gun in the pulpit, preaches to his Sutherland Springs, Texas, congregation in 2020. <p>Josie Norris / The San Antonio Express-News via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">How did these two Christian leaders come to such opposite conclusions? Both read the same Bible, worship the same God and have suffered unfathomable losses to unspeakable violence at the hands of disturbed individuals who managed to acquire legal firearms. Yet on the issue of guns, there is a gulf between them. And, perhaps what’s most important, Risher’s and Pomeroy’s dividing paths highlight two very different relationships between guns and God in America today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ passion for the right to bear arms has a long and well-known history. But the relationship between religion and guns is often obscured by the horror and tragedy of mass shootings like those that terrorized the Charleston and Sutherland Springs congregations. However, activists, scholars and pastors now point to a shift in the relationship between religion and guns, with more people of faith realizing that despite a range of views on the proliferation and use of guns, they have a theological and moral imperative to speak out on the issue. Even so, security-training companies say houses of worship make up the fastest-growing segment of their business as more churches, synagogues, mosques and temples are arming their congregations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The cross and the gun give us two really different versions of power,” said Shane Claiborne, a Christian activist and co-author of “<a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/beating-guns/388781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beating Guns: Hope for People Who Are Weary of Violence</a>.” “One of them says, ‘I’m willing to kill,’ and the other one says, ‘I’m willing to die.’”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As a pastor who owns and carries a gun, Pomeroy is not an outlier. Few studies examine gun ownership and religion, but scholars who have explored the subject see a definite link.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Religion does matter to gun ownership, but not in any one simplistic way,” said David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University who found that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312410212_Awash_in_a_Sea_of_Faith_and_Firearms_Rediscovering_the_Connection_Between_Religion_and_Gun_Ownership_in_America_FAITH_AND_FIREARMS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evangelical Protestants were more likely to be gun owners</a> compared with mainline Protestants, members of other religions and people with no religious affiliation. “The connection between gun ownership and religion is different depending on whether you are talking about religious behaving, belonging or believing.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yamane found, for instance, that Americans who hold more theologically conservative beliefs are more likely to own guns, but those who are more actively involved with their house of worship’s congregation are less likely to own guns. “These differences are essential to keep in mind if we want to have an accurate understanding of the connection between religion and guns,” he said.</p>

Today, only three states and Washington, D.C., prohibit firearms inside places of worship, according to the Giffords Law Center.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Overall, shootings in houses of worship are rare, but they are becoming more frequent. According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database published by The Washington Post</a>, 95 people have died in a mass shooting at a place of worship in the U.S. since 1966, and more than half of those people were killed in the past five years.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures are up-to-date as of May 12 and represent shootings where four or more people were killed and exclude shootings connected to robberies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> The impetus for these rampages ranged from domestic disputes — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tessa-brennaman-devin-kelley-sutherland-springs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the motivation of the Sutherland Springs killer</a> — to religious- or race-based hatred — the Mother Emanuel shooter <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dylann-roof-confesses-church-shooting-says-he-wanted-start-race-war-344797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped to start a race war</a>. Meanwhile, FBI data shows a 65 percent increase in hate crimes<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined by the FBI as a “criminal offense which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias(es) against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> at churches, synagogues, temples and mosques from 2014 to 2019,<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These hate crimes decreased by 26 percent from 2019 to 2020, though many houses of worship did not meet in person due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a> while the Faith Based Security Network notes a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/too-small-to-hire-guards-too-worried-to-go-gun-free-churches-are-now-arming-themselves/2020/02/14/8eabb574-3ee9-11ea-baca-eb7ace0a3455_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 percent increase in “non-accidental deaths”</a> at houses of worship between 2014 to 2017.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The perpetrators of these shootings have targeted houses of worship indiscriminately. In the past decade, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-news-religion-shootings-race-and-ethnicity-emanuel-kidega-samson-0b2a73fdcf944d19aaafa620bb1d94c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shootings at houses of worship with more than one fatality</a> include:</p>



<ul><li>Oak Creek, Wisconsin — On Aug. 5, 2012, a man belonging to several white supremacist groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/us/shooting-reported-at-temple-in-wisconsin.html">shot and killed six people and wounded four</a> at a Sikh gurdwara.

A member of the church’s security team, licensed to carry, shot and killed the perpetrator. The incident was captured during live video streaming of the service and has been watched on YouTube and Twitter millions of times.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">After every shooting, religious leaders appear in the media and call for peace and unity. Some, like Risher, call for “common-sense gun laws,” a term proponents of these measures prefer over “gun control,” which they say has a negative connotation. Others, including the Rev. Robert Jeffress, a member of former President Donald Trump’s faith advisory board, have no problem with their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/11/06/after-texas-church-massacre-a-push-for-armed-guards-and-gun-packing-parishioners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flock bringing guns to church for greater safety</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">"I'd say a quarter to a half of our members are concealed-carry — they have guns and I don't think there's anything wrong with that,” <a href="https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/927532536175009792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffress said on “Fox and Friends”</a> after the Sutherland Springs shooting. “They bring them into the church with them ... if somebody tries that in our church, they might get one shot off or two shots off, and that's the last thing they'll ever do in this life.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="http://ryanburge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Burge</a>, a professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University and an American Baptist Church pastor who has studied guns and religion, finds that political affiliation is a stronger indication of one’s views on guns than religion is, with Republicans more likely to support less legislation and Democrats in favor of more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gun control is a fascinating issue in American faith, because the data points to a clear conclusion,” <a href="https://religionunplugged.com/news/2020/7/2/party-politics-more-than-religion-drives-views-on-gun-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he wrote in 2020</a>. “Religious leaders are, by and large, not guiding the views of their congregations on this topic ... Americans of all religious faiths are less supportive of gun control now than at any point in the last two decades.” </p>

Cory Booker to speak about gun violence and its connection to white nationalism. <p>Randall Hill / REUTERS</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">On the organizational level, most denominations have made statements against gun violence — and sometimes, against guns themselves — especially after mass shootings. But only the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has ordained a “<a href="https://www.presbypeacefellowship.org/first-minister-of-gun-violence-prevention-ordained-in-the-united-states-presbyterian-rev-deanna-hollas-of-dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minister of gun violence prevention</a>,” the Rev. Deanna Hollas, who lives in a religious community outside Dallas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hollas felt called to this role when her daughter attended a Texas college that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/us/texas-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-guns-on-campus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows students to carry weapons on campus</a>. Now she visits mainline Protestant churches across the country to speak out against gun violence and perform “disarmings” — the dismantling of firearms per Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives guidelines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Not everyone is going to lay down their guns,” she said. “But we are going to say there is a different way.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Hollas is the only known minister exclusively assigned to work on gun violence, she believes that more people of faith are taking up the issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The good news is people are waking up to this,” she said. “Sight is being restored to the blind. The tools we have been using — that we are going to read and think our way out of gun violence — have not been effective. We are in the process of deconstructing that and realizing that we need to return to spiritual practices and embrace the faith of Jesus instead of the church of empire that we have inherited.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Increasingly, religious leaders in favor of gun reform are framing their argument as anti-violence rather than anti-gun. Among these are Claiborne, the Philadelphia-based leader of <a href="https://www.redletterchristians.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Letter Christians</a>, a faith-based organization that emphasizes the words of Jesus — which are printed in red letters in some Bibles — to oppose gun violence and other societal ills. Clairborne was raised in a hunting and gun-owning family but now travels the U.S. literally beating surrendered guns into garden tools and other implements.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We're worshipping the Prince of Peace on Sunday and packing heat on Monday, sometimes even packing heat on Sunday,” he said a few days before traveling to Houston to dismantle guns collected by a local congregation. “Some of our idolatry of individual rights is at the heart of this too.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Claiborne knows Christians who carry guns and bring them to church — <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/guns-in-public/location-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 states have no restrictions on doing so</a>. He said he understands Pomeroy’s decision to arm himself and his congregation but added that this doesn’t align with his understanding of the same faith.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It's very reasonable to do what the pastor at Sutherland Springs did,” he said, noting that he does not know Pomeroy and does not want to judge him. “In fact, it's exactly what [Jesus’ disciple] Peter wanted to do when he picked up a sword to try to defend Jesus, and Jesus says, ‘<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18:10-11&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Put your weapon away</a>.’ For me, as a Christian, there’s no way that I can reconcile Jesus’ call to love our enemy with this idea that we’re going to stand our ground or kill our enemy.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is Risher’s conclusion, too. She said she has forgiven her mother’s murderer. “If I did not, it was going to eat me alive,” she said. “And I wanted to live. And I did not want to live as a victim.” Now she travels the country to encourage other people of faith to put down any weapons they may own.</p>

Yes, God gives us prayer, but he gives us the motivation and the willingness to take action.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Claiborne’s actions have included organizing a <a href="https://www.redletterchristians.org/death-be-not-proud-the-easter-gospel-of-non-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peaceful protest and demonstration</a> outside a Philadelphia gun store. Risher volunteers with <a href="https://www.everytown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everytown for Gun Safety</a> and <a href="https://momsdemandaction.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>. Catholic priests, <a href="https://isna.net/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muslim imams</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RabbisAgainstGunViolence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jewish rabbis</a> and other <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/opinion/kaur-oak-creek-anniversary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religious leaders</a> have walked the streets of cities plagued by gun violence in the hope of interrupting the violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pastormikemcbride.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rev. Michael McBride</a> is one of those pastors. As director of the <a href="http://www.livefreeusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Free Campaign</a>, an anti-violence and anti-mass-incarceration activist group, he and a cadre of San Francisco-area clergy routinely walk the streets of Oakland and other Bay Area cities where gun violence is routine. They do not focus on gun legislation, but on actions they hope will “interrupt” the cycle of violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gun control is one part of the conversation, but too many people in the gun-control community want gun control to be the lion’s share of the conversation,” he said. “I think at best it should be 25 percent of the conversation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McBride, who grew up in Hunter’s Point, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Troubling-trend-in-San-Francisco-32-jump-in-15585017.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hot spot for gun crimes in the Bay Area</a>, came to this work after seeing the results of gun violence up close. “Once you do a dozen funerals … it changed me,” he said. “I asked, ‘Is this the most that I could do?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now his group holds “call-ins” — mediated conversations between gun offenders, faith leaders, crime victims, ER nurses and police — and organizes 12-month programs for gun offenders, or “peace cohorts,” that focus on working them into their communities. Gun-control legislation, he said, rarely comes up as a viable solution to urban gun crimes, especially when he is facing an anguished mother who wants to know why her son or daughter was shot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The church, McBride said, should be an advocate for “common-sense gun legislation,” but it cannot end there. People of faith must also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675720305507?casa_token=fLGjlYBOxMMAAAAA:_0PBeCWDM99QcYDnSe1vHJz4YFrrHAIlUVyTXTXckYwyiL6jqoNnldTlOAWF50wdTNIc6cqe_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look at the causes of the violence</a> — income inequality, mass incarceration, mental-health issues and trauma, among them.</p>

Michael McBride (with bullhorn) participates in a candlelight vigil for the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. <p>Alex Wong / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“The church has to boldly proclaim the need for healing and peacemaking in our communities,” he said over a diner breakfast before heading to <a href="https://www.thewayberkeley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Way Christian Center</a>, a Berkeley church he and his family have led for three generations. “We have to use our pulpits and platforms to advocate for peace, for policies and programs. We have to scale up intervention to change lives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s a tall order for anyone, clergy or layperson. Shani Buggs, a professor at University of California, Davis’s <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/vprp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violence Prevention Research Program</a>, said while some clergy are involved in violence-interruption programs, very few actively promote gun-reform laws.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s a complicated issue for them,” she said. “It has become increasingly political.” And politics is often considered taboo in houses of worship, which can lose their tax-exempt status if they engage in campaigning — not to mention lose members who may disagree.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No one knows this better than <a href="https://www.revrobschenck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rev. Rob Schenck</a>. Schenck spent 20 years as a very public activist for <a href="https://www.operationrescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Rescue</a>, the conservative Christian anti-abortion-rights group known for their graphic protests at women’s health clinics. He was also the president and founder of <a href="https://faithandlibertydc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faith and Action</a> (now Faith &amp; Liberty), a Washington, D.C., organization, which according to Schenck had 55,000 donors and a $2 million annual budget; the group’s aim was to increase Christianity’s influence on the U.S. government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the 2010s, Schenck had a change of heart on abortion, same-sex marriage and guns — three issues central to evangelical identity. In 2018, he resigned from Faith and Action over differences about his anti-gun mission. He then founded <a href="http://www.tdbi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dietrich Bonhoeffer Institute</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to the German cleric’s theology and ethics, which Schenck says has 4,000 donors and a $400,000 annual budget.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1137756833.jpg" alt="Rev.

Rob Schenck speaks at a press conference ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings to call on the Senate to pass gun-reform legislation. <p>MANDEL NGAN / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Schenck is not daunted by the change. Instead, he uses his experience inside the evangelical world to talk to conservative pastors and congregations about their affinity for guns. Drawing on his time in Operation Rescue, he frames his argument as an extension of the pro-life movement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m not the first one to have this thought, but the right to life does not end when the baby is born,” he said from his office in Washington, D.C. “That’s the way to find common ground with Catholics, with Jews, with Muslims, with conservatives, with liberals, with conservative Christians, progressive Christians, mainline Christians.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s still a hard sell. Schenck was the main subject of the 2015 documentary “<a href="https://www.armoroflightfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Armor of Light</a>,” which shows him trying to convince a room full of white evangelical clergy to join his side of the gun issue. They stare back at him as if he had asked them to fly to the moon and back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“When I look into the eyes of those folks, I think they really genuinely believe that God wants them to own a gun,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Schenck has hope. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young evangelicals like Claiborne are more open to questioning and reframing the church’s relationship with guns than their parents or grandparents were. “They’re more skeptical about the Second Amendment and the pro-gun culture and more serious about what Jesus literally said,” said Schenck. “They think this question is worth looking at.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/gun-ammunition-stores-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBISWorld</a>, an industry analyst, Americans spend $15 billion in gun stores annually. That includes everything from firearms and ammunition to cases, safes, apparel and accessories.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of these products link religion — most often Christianity — to the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. Go to Amazon, Etsy, Walmart or any major retail chain and you will see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raised-Protected-Glory-Pullover-Hoodie/dp/B08LM9B9Z3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothes</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1084793373/god-guns-trump-flag?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=flag+God+and+guns&amp;ref=sc_gallery-1-1&amp;plkey=a6cebffcb82cbe09b2ca445123b431fa4bf27135%3A1084793373&amp;frs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flags</a>, <a href="https://shopgodandguns.com/products/signature-charm-bracelet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charm bracelets</a>, <a href="https://www.hobbylobby.com/Home-Decor-Frames/Mirrors-Wall-Decor/Quote-Wall-Art/God-Guns-Guts-Metal-Wall-Decor/p/80826976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wall plaques</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/130566652931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license plate holders</a> and just about everything else available with symbols and slogans declaring fidelity to God and guns. One company called Tactical Baby Gear sells a patch emblazoned with <a href="https://tacticalbabygear.com/products/god-gods-diaper-patch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“God, Guns &amp; Diapers”</a> under the outline of an AR-15-style assault rifle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Schenck likes to bring out a black-bound, leather Bible cover that opens up to reveal not the usual tissue-thin pages but a 9mm Glock — a gun literally wrapped in the word of God.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In our defense of the Second Amendment,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrTkCPw1CQY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schenck asks in a video</a> as he holds the Bible-as-gun-case, “are we in fact violating the Second Commandment?” In Protestant faiths, that commandment is “Thou shalt not make any graven image.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And dozens of companies, from small mom-and-pop outfits to national organizations, offer security and firearms training specially tailored for pastors, ushers and greeters, and for teams of armed “guardians” or “gate keepers.” Agape Tactical offers a “<a href="https://agapetactical.com/services/warrior-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warrior Women</a>” class for armed women in the pews and quotes the biblical book of Proverbs on its website: “A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.” One pastor <a href="https://circuit-magazine.com/church-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Circuit Magazine</a>, “Church security is becoming the business of the church.” </p>

In 2015 — the year of the Mother Emanuel shooting — he said Strategos did church training sessions in 30 houses of worship. Now they do 300 annually, a number that spiked dramatically after the Sutherland Springs massacre<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/mass-shootings-church-synagogue-temple.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Strategos, which is Christian in its mission and has since conducted training at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, approaches its work like a ministry. Instructors and trainees pray and sometimes worship together.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We believe humility breeds capability,” he said in a phone interview from Kansas City, Missouri, where he is based. “I think you can tell how powerful somebody is by how gentle they are.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In its two-day church training workshops, Strategos teaches that the use of guns is a sort of last resort, Young said. First, they focus on awareness and prevention — strategically placing greeters in the parking lot, training ushers to spot erratic behavior, reconfiguring the church’s locks and other existing safety measures and — most importantly, Young said — verbal de-escalation methods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We choose who we certify to carry, not the church,” Young said. “They must have a mindset for safety. If they don’t exhibit the right frame of mind” — for example, if they are too eager to shoot or too nervous to shoot — “then we won’t certify them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young said Strategos declines to certify 2 to 5 percent of trainees because they do not pass this kind of “spiritual gut check.” And the majority — 85 percent — of its church workshops do not include guns, Young said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We will do it [gun training] if they ask,” Young said. “But I would rather a church have an unarmed security team that is trained than an armed security team that is untrained.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Like everyone else in this story, Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs looks at the relationship between guns and religion through the prism of his own experience. And that extends to losing members of his own congregation, including his daughter, to a disturbed man with a semi-automatic rifle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the media frenzy that descended on his white-walled church after the violence, Pomeroy feels he and other licensed, gun-carrying Christians have been unfairly portrayed as “ignorant hillbillies.” The decision to carry a gun in the pulpit, put about 20 of the church’s 187 members through security training and ensure 10 of them are armed every Sunday morning was made after prayer and reflection, he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He thinks it is a mistake to spiritualize a gun — an inanimate object — and likens his <a href="https://www.kimberamerica.com/pistols/micro-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kimber Micro 9 handgun</a> to the automated external defibrillator that hangs on the church wall. The spiritual question isn’t whether it should be there, but how it should be used.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The only spiritual aspect of this is the human condition,” Pomeroy said. “A person who wrongfully uses firearms to take a life has deeper issues than the firearm. They have sin problems and issues that need to be addressed on a spiritual level. The firearm itself is not the problem, it's the people holding those firearms.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs meets in a brand-new building. The old church was clapboard, and the shooter shot through its walls. The new building, which opened its doors in May 2019, is fortified limestone with sanctuary doors that can be locked at the press of a button.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pomeroy hopes he never has to use his gun inside his church (he was away in Oklahoma City on the day of the shooting). Today he speaks publicly in other churches and on panels about church security. Sometimes people on the panel oppose him, which he welcomes as a means to de-escalate the political polarization in America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When told about the Rev. Sharon Risher and how she came to a completely different understanding of guns through the lens of their shared Christianity, he said he would be open to talking to her about their shared experience as grieving survivors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If we don’t have an open mind and come to the table to have a conversation about it, then there’s no way to ever win,” he said. “And it isn’t about winning. It’s about doing what is best for people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“And I would pray for her,” Pomeroy adds. “Not to change her mind so much as that hopefully myself or someone like me is there to protect her when we’re needed because she wouldn't be able to protect herself.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Despite what you may have heard, Virginia can still be a purple state. Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-glenn-youngkin-projected-win-virginia-governors-race/story?id=80864529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s gubernatorial contest</a> on Tuesday, becoming the first Republican to win a statewide office in Virginia since 2009. As of Wednesday morning, Youngkin led by around 2.5 percentage points — pretty much in line with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what pre-election polls showed</a> and good enough to become the Old Dominion’s next governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Coming into the election, FiveThirtyEight put together benchmark margins in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_counties_in_Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all 133</a> of Virginia’s counties and independent cities based on <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2020 election result</a> to provide a road map to show which way the race was trending as the votes came in.<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, we uniformly adjusted the 2020 margins to comprise a tied, 50-50 race &lt;em&gt;statewide&lt;/em&gt;. That way, the county-level margins marked what Youngkin or McAuliffe needed to beat in any particular county or independent city to win overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> And we can use those now, with almost all the votes counted, to unpack how Youngkin won. In the near-final analysis, Youngkin prevailed by outperforming those benchmarks in most parts of the commonwealth — and beating former President Donald Trump’s performance in every locality in the state. The map and table below lay out how each county and city voted compared to the benchmarks, and they show the relative breadth of Youngkin’s gains.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Performing well in the suburbs, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/trump-broke-suburbs-gop-virginia-516412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump struggled</a>, is key to unlocking Virginia, and Youngkin made serious inroads in those parts of the state. Take Loudoun and Chesterfield counties, two of the largest suburban counties in the state. Loudoun, which sits outside of Washington, D.C., still went for McAuliffe by about 11 percentage points, but that marked a huge deterioration for Democrats in comparison to Biden’s 25-point edge there last November. This was an example of Youngkin not necessarily needing to win a fairly blue municipality, but doing enough to cut the margins to help his cause overall. Chesterfield, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/election-2020/democrats-flip-chesterfield-blue-for-first-time-in-72-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditionally been a Republican-leaning county</a> that sits just south of the state capital of Richmond. Biden won it by about 7 points in 2020, but Chesterfield returned to its formerly red ways as Youngkin carried it by close to 10 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, the main areas where Youngkin didn’t improve as markedly (and ran behind our benchmarks) tended to be very red localities in the western part of the state. But Youngkin still won all those strongly Republican places by huge margins anyway, outperforming Trump. And as land, rocks and trees can’t vote, Youngkin’s tremendous showing in the more populous parts of Virginia really gave him his victory on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the sizable shifts toward the GOP across the commonwealth, Virginia’s result wasn’t just about Youngkin, however. One inescapable fact about this election is that it took place in an environment that was favorable to Republicans. There’s no better indicator of that than President Biden’s poor approval rating, which stood at about 43 percent coming into Election Day in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>. Republicans were already more likely to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show up in reaction</a> to having a Democratic president, and Biden’s struggles likely turned off some independent voters, too, as the exit poll found they went for Youngkin by 9 points, 54 percent to 45 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Youngkin improved on Trump’s performance with white voters (both men and especially women), who also made up a bigger share of the electorate this year compared to 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia exit polls</a>. White Virginians accounted for 74 percent of voters, up from 67 percent last year. In particular, Youngkin did significantly better than Trump among white women with “some college or less,” per the exit polls: He carried that group 75 percent to 25 percent, greatly improving on Trump’s 56 percent to 44 percent performance with them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The simplest way, though, to describe how Youngkin won is basically that he just performed better across the board, and did so via both turnout and vote choice. At least according to the exit polls (which aren’t always reliable, so we’ll be looking at this question in other ways in the coming days), the electorate that turned out in 2021 was older and whiter than the one that turned out in 2020, and more friendly to Republicans in other ways. And Youngkin improved on Trump’s performance with a host of demographic groups across that electorate.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, just over 3.3 million Virginians cast a ballot, which works out to around 52 to 53 percent of the voting-eligible population -- record turnout for a modern Virginia governor’s race. If the competitiveness of the 2020 presidential election with <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTIONS/oakvendenpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest turnout</a> since women got the right to vote didn’t convince you that Republicans can benefit as much or even more from high-turnout elections than Democrats, perhaps the Virginia election will be the nail in the coffin for the belief that high turnout is only good for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The support Youngkin attracted also materialized down the ballot at a similar rate, too, as the Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/statewide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won nearly identical shares of the vote to Youngkin</a> (as of this writing, only the lieutenant governor race <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/winsome-sears-voted-virginias-next-lieutenant-governor-first-woman-to-hold-position" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been projected for the GOP</a>). The similarity in results is unsurprising in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarized age</a> with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little ticket-splitting</a>, and those factors appear to have potentially given <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans the edge in the Virginia House of Delegates</a>, too, as they led 51 seats to 49 seats in still-to-be-finalized results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the wake of this victory, many Republicans are sure to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2021-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embrace the campaign strategy and chief issues</a> that Youngkin used in his victorious effort. That means trying to straddle being pro-Trump but not so Trump-y that you repel suburban voters, while also talking about “education” and the economy. (For a discussion of how education became an umbrella term that includes race, racism, COVID-19 school closures and more, please <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our election live blog</a>.) The exit polls in Virginia found those were the two most important topics for voters, with Youngkin winning voters who prioritized those issues by a little more than 10 points. This approach is not guaranteed to work for every Republican candidate in 2022, but it could be a useful road map for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-virginia-governors-race-is-not-a-good-political-barometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t know with absolute certainty</a> that the Virginia race is a harbinger of things to come in the 2022 midterm elections, but the result does show how damaging an electoral environment like the current one could be for the Democrats next year. History suggests they, as the party that holds the White House, have a hard road to keep control of Congress in 2022, but the Virginia race demonstrates how even seemingly winnable races could be lost if Biden remains as unpopular as he is now. How much Biden rights the ship of state in the coming months will be critical to determining just how ripe of an environment Republicans have next year.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, gun rights is <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-bruen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back at the Supreme Court</a> for the first time in over a decade. The justices will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/us/supreme-court-gun.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighing the constitutionality of a New York law</a> that imposes limits on carrying guns outside the home, setting up a showdown over just how far the Second Amendment goes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Depending on what the justices do, this case could have a <em>much</em> bigger impact on Americans’ lives — and the fate of gun regulations more broadly — than the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-second-amendment-didnt-protect-your-right-to-own-a-gun-until-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court’s last blockbuster gun rights decision</a>. Although that decision, released in 2008 as part of a case called <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, profoundly shifted the law around the Second Amendment by determining that the amendment covered the personal right to own a gun, it directly affected only a handful of gun restrictions. And <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research conducted over the past 10 years</a> hasn’t found a big shift in how lower courts are interpreting the Second Amendment; few gun laws have been struck down as a result.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could change this time. At a minimum, striking down the New York law would likely result in changes to concealed-carry regulations in at least <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2021/05/supreme-court-gun-rights-concealed-carry-new-york-corlett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six other states</a>, which could mean more guns on the streets of the nation’s two biggest cities. And if the court’s conservative majority decides to issue a more sweeping decision, this case could also open the door for a flood of challenges to other gun restrictions.</p>



<h2><strong>The last big gun rights ruling left lots of restrictions in place</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s ruling in Heller was undeniably a big deal, at least symbolically. For more than 200 years, the federal courts had approached the Second Amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-ii/interps/99" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a right that belonged to a “well-regulated militia”</a> as outlined in the Constitution — not an individual person’s right to own a gun. But colonial-era militias faded away relatively quickly, which made it pretty much impossible for anyone to successfully argue that their Second Amendment rights were being violated, according to <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/dmiller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darrell Miller</a>, a professor at Duke University School of Law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That changed after 2008. In the Heller ruling, a five-justice Supreme Court majority said that focusing on the militia was a misunderstanding of the core meaning of the Second Amendment. Americans did possess an individual right to carry guns in defense of their home, much as gun rights advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/nra-second-amendment-guns-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been arguing</a> for the past few decades. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In his dissent</a>, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens called it a “law-changing decision” and a “dramatic upheaval in the law.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stevens was right — and wrong. Heller <em>was</em> a fundamental change in constitutional rights. “It was a big deal to have the Supreme Court of the United States say to gun rights advocates, ‘Yes, actually, you have a meritorious argument about a Second Amendment right to have a gun in the home,’” Miller said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on a practical level, Heller’s impact was quite limited. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the majority opinion</a>, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stressed that there were still plenty of circumstances in which gun regulations were constitutional. “Nothing in our opinion,” he wrote, “should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/amendment-didnt-protect-gun-2008-fivethirtyeight-80824464</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And over the next 10 years, the decision didn’t revolutionize gun laws. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a study</a>, law professors Eric Ruben and Joseph Blocher analyzed over 1,000 lower-court decisions involving the Second Amendment between June 26, 2008 — when Heller was decided — and February 1, 2016. They found that very few of those cases were successful. In many cases, judges quoted Scalia’s caveat in their opinion, underscoring the fact that they saw plenty of room for regulation within the Heller decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Many people feared or hoped that gun laws would fall like dominoes [after Heller],” Ruben said. But that hasn’t proved to be the case. In fact, Ruben added, “judges of all ideological stripes have been upholding gun laws.”</p>



<h2><strong>But this gun rights case could change regulations across the country</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The case the justices will hear this term, though, directly addresses one of the most important questions left open by Heller: Can states put restrictions on Americans’ ability to carry guns in public for self-defense? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Specifically, they’ll be weighing a New York law that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/26/22364154/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment-new-york-state-rifle-corlett-shootings-kavanaugh-barrett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires applicants for gun licenses to show</a> “proper cause,” <a href="https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-klenosky-v-ny-city-police-dept" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally understood to mean</a> a heightened need for self-defense in the public sphere. At least six other states, including California, have similar laws, which means that striking down the New York regulation would have far-reaching implications. Those states would likely need to modify their restrictions in ways that would allow a lot more people to obtain guns. And that would have an impact on a lot of people, since it’s currently extremely difficult to get a concealed-carry permit in large cities like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-does-it-really-take-to-get-a-concealed-carry-permit-in-new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/los-angeles-sheriff-expand-concealed-weapons-permits-crime-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gun rights advocates argue that looser regulations on concealed weapons <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/184422/20210720153608584_20-843%20tsac%20Arizona%20Missouri%20et%20al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would actually make those cities safer</a>, since everyday people would be in a better position to defend themselves. But there’s a lot of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence suggesting that’s not true</a>. Multiple <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31361355/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> have suggested that a heavily armed populace doesn’t increase safety — in fact, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one study found</a> that relaxing permit requirements was associated with an increase in violent crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just the fate of concealed-carry restrictions that could hang in the balance in this case, though. The Supreme Court could issue a far-reaching ruling that not only strikes down New York’s law but also sets out a whole new way of evaluating whether gun regulations are constitutional — calling many kinds of gun laws into question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are clues to how the court could do this <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/07/judge-kavanaugh-and-the-second-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a sequel case to Heller</a> that was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2011, when now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a circuit court judge on the panel. <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DECA496973477C748525791F004D84F9/%24file/10-7036-1333156.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavanaugh dissented</a> from the majority opinion, which upheld a D.C. ban on semiautomatic weapons. He argued that when considering the constitutionality of gun regulations, judges should use an approach that weighs the “text, history, and tradition” of a given kind of law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the other conservatives could be open to that line of thinking. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-confirmation/2020/10/13/923215778/barrett-an-originalist-says-meaning-of-constitution-doesn-t-change-over-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a self-proclaimed textualist</a>, was skeptical of gun restrictions as a lower-court judge, too, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-barrett-gun-laws/2020/10/10/3845995e-0976-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going so far as to argue</a> in a 2019 dissent that some felons shouldn’t be stripped of their rights to own guns. Justice Clarence Thomas has also been outspoken about his desire to take on more gun cases. In 2018, he dissented from the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear a case about a California gun law, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/thomas-dissents-from-supreme-court-decision-not-to-review-california-gun-law/2018/02/20/342c378e-164d-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling the Second Amendment a “constitutional orphan.”</a> And the third Trump appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has less of a paper trail on gun rights, but <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2017/03/neil-gorsuch-gun-rights-advocates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocates expect him to be sympathetic to textualist arguments</a> — much as Scalia was.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard, of course, to predict how the justices will come down in this specific case, and even Kavanaugh’s approach wouldn’t necessarily spell the end of gun regulation, since as Ruben pointed out, gun regulation has existed for a long time in the United States — in fact, the New York law that’s being challenged <a href="https://nypost.com/2012/01/16/the-strange-birth-of-nys-gun-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is more than 100 years old</a>. But it could lead to a lot of complications, since <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/20/opinions/supreme-court-gun-rights-case-lethality-tucker/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guns are much deadlier now</a> than when the Second Amendment was written, and the mass violence that gun regulations are designed to combat <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-09-01/mass-shooting-data-odessa-midland-increase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is itself a modern phenomenon</a>, which could make a historical approach pretty challenging.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as Ruben pointed out, this approach could leave plenty of room for discretion on the part of judges trying to figure out whether gun laws are constitutional, which is important because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-made-the-federal-courts-whiter-and-more-conservative-and-that-will-be-tough-for-biden-to-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the federal judiciary is much more conservative</a> than it was 10 years ago. “Trying to decide whether a modern taser law is sufficiently similar to historical laws on muskets or other weapons — there’s so much subjectivity in that,” he said. More broadly, Americans’ gun rights are also still being worked out in real time. “It’s being articulated and developed for the first time in our lifetimes, and that makes it unique among constitutional rights,” Ruben said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means there’s a lot of room for the new conservative majority to shape gun rights in America going forward — if they can get on the same page about what that should look like.</p>]]></description>

In particular, the Data Editor will be responsible for reviewing the methodological and statistical choices made in our stories, checking the accuracy of statistical and empirical claims made across all areas of coverage (politics, sports, science, etc.), publishing datasets we’ve created and maintaining internal reference databases.
