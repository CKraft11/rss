			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Election Day 2021 is only about two weeks away, and the big race to watch is undoubtedly Virginia’s gubernatorial contest. A <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still-somewhat purple state with a Democratic lean in recent presidential elections</a>, Virginia <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/can-you-be-my-bellwether" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be viewed</a> by many as a bellwether for the 2022 midterms, and the race is already proving to be a testing ground for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-republican-might-win-in-virginias-governor-race-and-how-new-jerseys-race-could-get-tighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the big national issues</a> that could very well influence elections next year, including COVID-19 policies, what should be in taught in schools and the economy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, aims to regain his old job and continue a 13-election winning streak for Democrats in Virginia statewide races since 2012,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President and U.S. Senate in 2012; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2013; U.S. Senate in 2014; president in 2016; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2017; U.S. Senate in 2018; and president and U.S. Senate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> while Glenn Youngkin hopes to break that run and deliver a gubernatorial election victory to the GOP for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/us/04vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first time since 2009</a>. And according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Virginia polling average</a>, it really is either candidate’s race to win. McAuliffe leads by only a few percentage points, suggesting a close, competitive race that, while somewhat likelier to result in a Democratic victory, could go either way.</p>

The poll also found that Republicans benefited from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s underwater approval rating</a>, including dissatisfaction toward the president <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among independent voters</a>. To be sure, campaign polls like this one <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to overstate how well the candidate is performing by 4 to 5 points</a>, but recent public polling does suggest it’s a close race, and those surveys also show that Biden might be a drag on the Democratic ticket. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A survey conducted Oct. 4-11 by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-governor-race-vaccine-economy-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News/YouGov</a>, for instance, found McAuliffe leading among likely voters by 3 points, 50 percent to 47 percent. The poll also found Biden’s approval rating at 48 percent and his disapproval rating at 52 percent in Virginia. Similarly, an <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/virginia-2021-dead-heat-in-governor-and-attorney-general-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College poll</a> from earlier this month also found Biden’s ratings underwater in the commonwealth, at 45 percent approval versus 48 percent disapproval. That poll also found McAuliffe and Youngkin running neck and neck at 49 percent, the Republican’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best recent public survey</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Together, the Virginia numbers <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-has-bidens-approval-rating-gotten-so-low-so-quickly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">echo Biden’s decline in national approval polling</a> and suggest his standing in Virginia has declined meaningfully since <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 10-point victory over then-President Donald Trump</a> last November, which has produced an electoral environment that could be friendly enough for the GOP to win the governorship.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And given the narrow margins in the polls, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrsts-virginia-governor/2021/09/29/47f3099a-2135-11ec-9309-b743b79abc59_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are concerned</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/10/politics/terry-mcauliffe-congress-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including McAuliffe</a>, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcauliffe-calls-biden-unpopular-in-virginia-amid-bellwether-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently told a group of Democrats</a> in a teleconference that the campaign had to “plow through” the “headwinds from Washington” because of the president’s unpopularity in Virginia. On the one hand, McAuliffe was in this situation before and came out on top. He won in 2013 when another Democratic president, Barack Obama, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had an approval rating</a> in the mid-40s and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia was redder</a> than it is now. (McAuliffe’s 2013 win actually <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-surprisingly-dramatic-terry-ken-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the first victory</a> for the president’s party in a Virginia gubernatorial election since 1973). On the other hand, Youngkin may be a more formidable foe than McAuliffe’s 2013 opponent, then-Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2013/11/06/terry-mcauliffe-three-reasons-why-he-is-the-new-governor-elect-of-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy to portray as a right-wing ideologue</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-trounces-cuccinelli-in-late-donations-in-virginia-governors-race/2013/10/31/f0749b7a-423a-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailed McAuliffe badly in fundraising</a>. By comparison, Youngkin <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/virginia-republicans-just-gave-themselves-a-chance-to-win-back-the-governorship/2021/05/11/574c545a-b281-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have a track record to attack</a> — he’s never held office — and as a former finance executive, he also has a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governors-race-financial-disclosures/2021/07/01/b697b70e-da9c-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast amount of personal wealth</a> to spend on the race, which <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/09/virginia-governors-race-tightens-mcauliffe-youngkin-report-big-fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has helped him</a> slightly outpace McAuliffe <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/governor/elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in overall fundraising</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In terms of the issues, McAuliffe <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/23/virginia-governor-race-vaccines-democrats-513705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been hammering</a> Youngkin over his opposition to a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, and that CBS News/YouGov poll suggests this could be a winning issue for the Democrat: 54 percent of likely voters backed Virginia businesses requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees, and more voters (46 percent) thought McAuliffe would handle vaccines better than Youngkin (41 percent). Abortion could also be an important issue for McAuliffe, following the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court’s decision to allow a restrictive Texas abortion law</a> to go into effect, as almost 60 percent of Virginia voters in both the CBS News/YouGov and Emerson College polls said that abortion should always be legal or legal with some restrictions. The issue could especially motivate the Democratic base, as Democrats across the country <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-may-now-motivate-democrats-more-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now more likely than Republicans to say the issue</a> is “very important” to them. However, Virginians in the CBS News/YouGov survey thought Youngkin would create more jobs than McAuliffe (45 percent to 41 percent) and do more to reduce violent crime (45 percent to 35 percent). That latter advantage stands out, as Youngkin <a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/loudoun-sheriff-in-latest-youngkin-ad-claims-mcauliffe-s-policies-won-t-make-virginia-safe/article_70f9bbae-0c31-11ec-8bdd-bf95853e32db.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tried to portray McAuliffe</a> as incapable of keeping Virginians safe. Additionally, Youngkin has attacked McAuliffe over school curricula and parents’ control of their children’s education, including by seizing on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/07/politics/glenn-youngkin-parental-rights-education-strategy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a clip of McAuliffe at a debate</a> in late September where he said, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” Emerson College’s poll found 52 percent of voters felt parents should have more influence on school curricula than school boards, compared with 33 percent who prioritized school boards.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the polls could be overselling the GOP’s chances, like they did in 2017 when Republican Ed Gillespie trailed Democrat Ralph Northam <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/governor/va/virginia_governor_gillespie_vs_northam-6197.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by about 3 points going into the election</a> — similar to where Youngkin is now — but ended up <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2017&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing by 9 points</a>. That’s impossible to say with any certainty, as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direction of polling error is inconsistent</a> from one cycle to the next. But polls that model higher turnout, such as the CBS News/YouGov survey, which found that McAuliffe led Youngkin by 8 points instead of 3 points in a high-turnout situation, suggest Democrats could perform better than expected if pollsters are underestimating turnout. Higher-than-expected turnout might be in play, too, considering the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-midterms-in-4-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly high levels</a> of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/turnout-soared-in-2020-as-nearly-two-thirds-of-eligible-u-s-voters-cast-ballots-for-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participation in recent elections</a> and Virginia’s <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/how-virginia-made-voting-easier-and-fairer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push in the past couple of years</a> to make <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/new-virginia-voting-laws-take-effect-make-voting-easier-more-accessible/291-331d6a27-3898-40e3-af91-bf83d7bfde1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting more accessible</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/08/23/democrats-sweat-turnout-disaster-in-california-without-trump-to-run-against-1390415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats had concerns</a> about turnout in California’s gubernatorial recall election earlier this year, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those worries proved unfounded</a> (although Virginia doesn’t mail a ballot to every voter like California did).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, it’s probably a mistake to equate 2021 with 2017. Four years ago, Virginia’s gubernatorial contest happened while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular Republican occupied the White House</a>, which helped boost Democrats. Now, a somewhat unpopular Democratic president could help Republicans. Consider that polls suggest that Republicans have a somewhat more energized base: 50 percent of likely Youngkin voters told CBS/YouGov they were “very enthusiastic” to vote, compared to 44 percent of McAuliffe backers, and a <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-10-08.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Newport University</a> survey of likely voters conducted in late September and early October also found more Republicans were “very enthusiastic” to vote (61 percent) than Democrats (55 percent). </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, voters can still cast a ballot regardless of how enthusiastic they are, but these findings do align with the expectation that we’ll see some degree of “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differential turnout</a>” in the election, or where voters from the party not in the White House are more likely to show up in a non-presidential election than those from the president’s party. Couple this with Youngkin’s advantage among independents — Youngkin led by 6 to 9 points among independents in those polls from CBS News/YouGov, Emerson College and Christopher Newport University — and it could be enough for a Youngkin win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Historically, Virginia hasn’t been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-virginia-governors-race-is-not-a-good-political-barometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an especially good barometer of the overall national environment</a>, but given how close the race currently is, the media and the parties will probably react strongly to whatever the result is: A Democratic win will be a sign that Democrats aren’t completely up a creek without a paddle in 2022, while a GOP victory will be a loud klaxon signaling a red wave next year. The truth is more complicated, of course, as one election should never be used as a benchmark on its own, but the spotlight will shine brightly on Virginia’s result nevertheless.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/the-public-is-highly-concerned-about-cyber-attacks-on-the-united-states/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-public-is-highly-concerned-about-cyber-attacks-on-the-united-states">AP-NORC poll</a> conducted last month, two-thirds of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about cyber attacks on national security and defense systems. And Americans seem to be most concerned by the threats that China and Russia pose: 73 percent of Americans thought the Chinese government was a big threat to the cybersecurity of the U.S. government, while 72 percent thought the Russian government was a big threat. By contrast, 53 percent said groups not affiliated with a foreign government posed a big threat to the U.S. government’s cybersecurity. </li><li>Just over a year before the 2022 midterm elections, 45 percent of registered voters say they are “extremely” enthusiastic (26 percent) or “very” enthusiastic (19 percent) to cast their ballots, per a recent <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/13064013/2110042_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a>. Those who voted for Republican House candidates in the 2018 midterms were slightly more likely to be extremely enthusiastic about voting in 2022 (34 percent) compared to voters who cast their ballots for Democratic House candidates in 2018 (29 percent). This 5-point gap isn’t all that big, but it does line up with research we cited earlier that suggests voters from the party not in the White House are often more motivated to vote in a non-presidential election.</li><li>Earlier this year, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">leaked internal documents to the Wall Street Journal</a> that showed Facebook was aware of negative effects it had on users as well as the negative effects of Instagram on teenage girls’ mental health. In <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/ABCNews/live-updates/live-updates-Facebook/?id=80401245">congressional testimony</a> this month, Haugen claimed Facebook knew about these harmful effects and did nothing about it. In light of this leak and testimony, 59 percent of Americans said they believed Haugen’s claims were true, per a <a href="https://leger360.com/surveys/legers-north-american-tracker-october-13-2021/">Leger/The Canadian Press survey</a>, although 24 percent said they hadn’t heard of the leak.</li><li>School mask mandates <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-school-districts-masks-place-defiance-governor-ban/story?id=80533872">continue to be hotly debated</a> between school districts, lawmakers and parents, sometimes resulting in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/back-to-school-live-updates/2021/08/20/1028841279/mask-mandates-school-protests-teachers">violent altercations</a>. Last week, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-addresses-violent-threats-against-school-officials-and-teachers">directed the FBI and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices</a> to investigate the harassment and threats of violence against school board members and teachers. It’s possible, though, that some Americans view this investigation as government overreach. According to a <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/coronavirus/parent_school_protests_protected_by_first_amendment_most_voters_agree">recent Rasmussen Reports survey</a>, 47 percent of likely voters said they opposed a federal investigation, with 39 percent “strongly” opposed and 8 percent “somewhat” opposed.</li><li>From Oct. 6 to Oct. 12, an average of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions">6,659 new COVID-19 patients</a> were admitted to a hospital in the United States, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This continued stream of COVID-19 patients has strained hospitals, and there is now a looming shortage of health-care workers in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/short-staffed-hospitals-battling-covid-surge-opting-staff/story?id=79360422">states like Florida, Arkansas, Texas and Alabama</a>. In a <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/04064018/2109015_crosstabs_MC_HEALTH_HEALTHCARE_WORKERS_Health_Care_Workers_v2_CC.pdf">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted in early September, 41 percent of health-care workers said shortages of workers within some health-care professions have had a “major” impact on them and their jobs, and a majority of health-care workers (51 percent) said their mental health had worsened since the pandemic spread to the United States. Yet still, 69 percent of health-care workers said they hadn’t considered leaving their job.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden Approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Local news is disappearing in towns across the country. From 2008 to 2019, the percentage of people who said they got their news from local papers every day <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1663/media-use-evaluation.aspx">fell by more than half</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It took a small town chiropractor named Charles Brown to help vaccinate millions of kids for decades to come — all because he didn’t want to vaccinate his own.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was 1979 in Houston, Mississippi, and Brown needed to enroll his 6-year-old son in school. But state law required the boy to be vaccinated against certain diseases, and Brown didn’t want to vaccinate his son. At the time, Mississippi had two exceptions to this law: medical exemption, for kids who had a medical condition that prevented them from receiving certain shots, and a religious exemption, but only for religious groups whose doctrines explicitly prohibit vaccination, such as Christian Scientists. Brown’s son wasn’t eligible for either exemption. So Brown sued.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brown <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/mississippi/supreme-court/1979/51553-0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued that</a> by limiting the exemption to only certain religious groups, the law violated his First Amendment rights and ought to be expanded to include <em>any</em> religion. (The Browns were Christian, but not a sect approved for a medical exemption.) The case made it to the state Supreme Court where it spectacularly backfired. Rather than expand the religious exemption, the justices argued that having the exemption at all was a violation of the 14th Amendment because it put the rights of certain religious parents over the rights of other parents. The state court struck down the exemption altogether. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that decision, <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi became just the second state</a> (after West Virginia) not to offer religious or personal belief exemptions to <a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/index.cfm/14,2029,71,pdf/MS_School_Immunization_Requirements_-_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its child vaccination mandate</a>. Mississippi now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/30/mississippi-yes-mississippi-has-the-nations-best-child-vaccination-rate-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently</a> has the country’s highest rates of vaccination among children entering school. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/us-unprepared-covid-fda-chief-80459329</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Mississippi’s childhood immunization rates are a sharp contrast to its COVID-19 vaccination numbers. As of Thursday, 44.5 percent of eligible Mississippians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html?.?mc=aud_dev&amp;ad-keywords=auddevgate&amp;gclsrc=ds&amp;gclsrc=ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fully vaccinated</a>, making it 46th in the nation. In fact, Mississippi’s overall vaccination record — outside of kindergarteners — isn’t great: The <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2019/10/08/mississippi-first-in-school-age-vaccines-lags-in-immunization-rates-for-teens-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state ranks much lower</a> when it comes to vaccine rates for toddlers and teens, as the vaccination requirement only applies to students entering school for the first time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s natural to wonder, then, whether Mississippi — and other vaccine-hesitant states — will expand their mandates to include the COVID-19 vaccine once it’s approved for kids as young as 5 years old. School mandates are one of the few tools states have to enforce vaccination, and <a href="http://www.pkids.org/immunizations/immunization_mandates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’re effective</a>. Other jurisdictions are already considering, or have already enacted, such a mandate: California has <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/california-is-mandating-covid-vaccines-for-kids-will-other-states-follow/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> plans to make the COVID-19 shot mandatory for grade school attendance, and <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/06/cambridge-public-schools-covid-19-vaccine-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school districts</a> across the country have <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/will-more-schools-follow-los-angeles-lead-and-require-covid-19-vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it a requirement</a> for extracurricular activities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But adding COVID-19 shots to existing school mandates is not without risk. If an unpopular and highly politicized vaccine is added to the list, those opposed may begin to challenge all vaccine requirements. It’s already happening in other states, to some extent. In Ohio, statehouse Republicans <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/continuing-coverage/coronavirus/vaccinating-ohio/ohio-house-holds-hearing-on-controversial-bill-that-would-essentially-ban-mandates-on-all-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a bill that would ban all vaccine mandates</a>, of any kind, for any vaccine, though it was never voted out of committee. And in Tennessee, Republican lawmakers pressured the state department of health into <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/23/tennessee-restart-vaccine-outreach-paused-amid-gop-pressure/8043482002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily halting vaccine outreach</a> to minors for any shot, not just the COVID-19 jab. It’s an idea that may be gaining popularity among Republican voters, too. The Economist/YouGov have historically surveyed Americans on whether or not they think “parents should be required to have their children vaccinated against infectious diseases.” In the past, and as recently as last year, the majority of both Republicans and Democrats answered yes, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/13/slippery-slope-gops-anti-vaccine-mandate-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a new poll</a> released yesterday, only 46 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement. This fight pits two very serious public health considerations against one another: Either keep the COVID-19 vaccine off the school mandate and risk leaving millions of children and communities at greater risk of the virus, or add it and risk the entire vaccine schedule falling under attack.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When it comes to childhood immunization, you simply can’t beat the Magnolia State. During the 2019-2020 school year, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/100473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 99 percent of Mississippi kindergarteners</a> were fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks kindergarten vaccination rates in every state for the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) and chickenpox vaccines. While childhood vaccination rates in the U.S. are generally high, Mississippi is exceptional — it has a more than 99 percent coverage rate for all three shots. Other state rates for kindergarteners ranged as low as 84 percent (for the DTaP vaccine in Indiana). The second-highest rate (in West Virginia, also for DTaP) was 98.8 percent. Childhood vaccine mandates have always been political, but they have typically not been partisan. The modern anti-vax movement has prompted fights surrounding the mandates and their exemptions, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-arent-new-to-the-anti-vaxx-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I’ve previously reported</a>, the anti-vax movement has long been a bipartisan affair. As a result, childhood vaccination rates don’t fall along partisan lines <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the way COVID-19 vaccination rates do</a> — red states are just as likely to have high childhood immunization rates as blue ones. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Like most states, Mississippi has had its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/us/mississippi-a-leader-on-vaccination-rates-stands-by-strict-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share of pushback</a> from anti-vaccine groups over the mandate (and in particular its lack of exemptions). But these efforts <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t amounted to much</a> beyond a few proposed bills that died in committee. Among the general public, the mandate has largely been tolerated as a fact of life, according to James Colgrove, a sociomedical science professor at Columbia University who studies public health policy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I haven’t found evidence that there was any widespread resistance,” Colgrove said. “The evidence we have for its acceptance is mostly negative evidence: the absence of lawsuits and controversy.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When measles outbreaks have occurred in recent years, <a href="https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2019/may/06/mississippi-evades-measles-activists-want-vaccine-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi has been spared</a> due to its high vaccination rates, even when outbreaks hit neighboring states. These outbreaks remind the public of just what vaccines protect them from and can be helpful for passing or upholding vaccine law. Consider California, which leveraged a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measles outbreak</a> to <a href="https://www.kqed.org/stateofhealth/41751/bill-ending-vaccine-exemptions-passes-california-senate-moves-to-governors-desk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do away with</a> its personal belief/religious exemption in 2015.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Mississippi has not embraced the COVID-19 vaccine in the same way. Government agencies and nonprofits have worked together to reduce barriers to accessing the vaccine — efforts that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mississippi-s-black-communities-turned-around-covid-rates-next-vaccines-n1268693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped the state close</a> its early racial gap. But nearly half the state’s eligible population remains unvaccinated, and the politicization of the pandemic has undoubtedly played a role. It’s reductive to suggest all of the vaccine hesitancy is simply due to Mississippi being a red state (Republicans are less likely than Democrats to be vaccinated for COVID-19), but there is a correlation: Counties with a higher voter share for Trump have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the state. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="The redder a Mississippi county gets, the lower its vaccination rate tends to be" aria-label="chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LBtEZ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="560" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“We often get reduced to backwoods, ignorant people who don’t know how to think. It’s much more nuanced than that,” said David Buys, the state health specialist at Mississippi State University Extension. “We have a lot of rugged individualism that serves us quite well. That’s not altogether bad. We want people to be critical thinkers. In this case, we do want people to rely a little bit more on the expertise of our public health officials.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That politicized tension makes the notion of mandating a COVID-19 vaccine for all school kids, once it’s available, much less likely in the state. Though <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ms/title-41-public-health/ms-code-sect-41-23-37.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state law grants authority</a> to the State Health Officer to specify which vaccines are required to enroll in school, new shots are rarely added. The most recent shot, for chickenpox, <a href="https://www.wlox.com/story/875654/chickenpox-vaccine-mandatory/#:~:text=Mississippi%20children%20entering%20daycare%20and,to%20enter%20preschool%20or%20kindergarten." target="_blank" rel="noopener">was added by the state department of health in 2002</a>, with little fanfare. But the vaccine against HPV — another <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/cancer-articles/public-perception-of-scientific-uncertainty-is-linked-to-hpv-vaccine-policy-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicized vaccine</a> — was never added (this is <a href="https://www.immunize.org/laws/hpv.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">true for most states</a>), despite it being <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended</a> by the CDC. The state department of health refused to answer a request for comment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates in Mississippi, whatever the means, will undeniably reduce the spread of the virus, but this vaccine is different from the ones currently required for school children. Aside from the politicization, COVID-19 is not a disease that primarily impacts kids the way measles, mumps, or pertussis do. Though the vaccine reduces the risk of infection, the risk of a severe infection or death from COVID-19 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/briefing/covid-age-risk-infection-vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already quite low for children</a>. This would make adding it to the school mandate an even harder sell in a state resistant to the jab. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there’s the concern that drawing attention to a law can have unintended consequences. (Just ask Charles Brown.) Given the COVID-19 vaccine’s heightened politicization, adding it to a school mandate could draw unwanted attention to the other mandated vaccines, and risk politicizing those as well. Some public health experts <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-fight-gottlieb-face-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have even warned against</a> including the COVID-19 vaccine in school mandates for this precise reason.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Health officers are creatures of the state and the health officer is probably keenly aware that trying to go that route could lead to political backlash,” said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a vaccine law expert at the University of California, Hastings. “I’d be surprised if, in a state with this level of hesitancy, this would happen.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mississippi isn’t alone in facing down this dilemma. As COVID-19 vaccines gain approval for kids aged 5 to 11 — which <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-tells-states-prepare-covid-vaccinations-young-children-n1281384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’re expected to</a> in the coming weeks — every state will need to grapple with whether or not existing school mandates ought to include COVID-19, or if the risk of drawing negative attention is too great. As Brown learned in his crusade to change the religious exemption, sometimes efforts to alter a law can wind up destroying it altogether.</p>

But following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in early September <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to block Texas’s new law</a> banning most abortions once an ultrasound can detect cardiac activity, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/02/republicans-abortion-texas-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/21/republicans-will-rue-texas-abortion-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/texas-abortion-law-even-more-absurd-practice/620265/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Democrats may become more motivated by reproductive rights. As one Republican pollster recently told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-texas-laws-election-2020-7f78f6ca27a40bb68b99947a4e63e76a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press</a>, “It is going to be a very motivating issue for women who haven’t typically been single-issue pro-choice voters.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tracking data from <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/economist/survey-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> seems to support this viewpoint. In each weekly survey since February, respondents were asked about the importance of abortion, and as we see in the chart below, the issue has become increasingly more important to Democrats and less important to Republicans ever since.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="966" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tesler.ABORTION-PUBLIC-OPINION.1013-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Throughout most of 2021, Trump voters were actually more likely than Biden voters to say that abortion is a “very important” issue to them. That matched the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long history</a> of abortion opponents rating the issue as more important than its proponents. But, as the chart above shows, this pattern was dramatically reversed after Texas’s abortion ban went into effect. Averaged across the five weekly surveys conducted by The Economist/YouGov since then, 51 percent of Biden backers rated abortion as a very important issue compared with just 39 percent of Trump supporters. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/07/women-abortion-texas-law-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult’s polling</a> shows that the share of Democratic women who said issues such as abortion, contraception and equal pay are central when voting for federal office nearly doubled immediately after Texas’s ban.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/texas-abortion-ban-rest-country-fivethirtyeight-79824406</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats were also almost twice as likely as Republicans to have heard “a lot” about new restrictive abortion laws in both Texas and Mississippi (49 percent vs. 26 percent, respectively in an <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/j46zs8picp/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oct. 3-5 Economist/YouGov poll</a>). This is likely due to how little airtime Texas’s law has gotten both <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/why-right-so-quiet-about-texass-abortion-law/619991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among Republican politicians</a> and conservative media outlets like Fox News. Consider that Fox News <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=abortion&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20210901000000&amp;edt=20210930235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fdn=raw&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> “abortion” 392 times in September, compared with 1,326 and 2,969 respective mentions on CNN and MSNBC.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a search of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC coverage from Sept. 1 to Sept. 30 in the Television News Archive using the GDELT 2.0 TV API. The database splits daily news footage into 15-second clips, and returned those that contained a mention of our search query (“abortion”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> Republican politicians and conservative media organizations are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/17/why-republicans-scared-texas-abortion-512554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly fearful</a> of the potential backlash from the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_092021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular Texas law</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that Democrats are both more likely to say abortion is important to them and to have heard a lot about Texas’s law dovetails nicely with a familiar pattern in public opinion research: Americans whose policy commitments are threatened respond by increasingly prioritizing those issues. This has happened <a href="https://themonkeycage.org/2013/02/who-cares-about-budget-deficits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple times</a> in recent decades during high-profile public policy debates and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-015-9317-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing research</a> even suggests that policy threats can mobilize election turnout.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We saw a similar phenomenon during former President Donald Trump administration’s efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In a poll conducted by <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/0c8pv9xegd/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist/YouGov</a> one week before the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton voters and Trump voters were equally likely to say that health care was a “very important” issue (76 percent and 75 percent, respectively). But as Trump and the Republican majority in Congress pushed to repeal Obamacare during the first year of his presidency, Democrats and Republicans increasingly diverged over the issue’s importance. By the <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/blvmt31w4l/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of April 2017</a>, health care was a very important issue among 85 percent of Clinton voters versus just 67 percent of Trump supporters. This is telling because Democratic voters went on to prioritize health care as their <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/midterm-exit-polls-2018-n932516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most important issue in the 2018 midterms elections</a>, with Democrats more than <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-election-tracking-poll-health-care-in-the-2018-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as likely as Republicans</a> to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether Democrats continue prioritizing abortion will inevitably depend in large part on how the Supreme Court rules next year on the constitutionality of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mississippi-abortion-clinic-braces-supreme-court-showdown-roe/story?id=80266499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Missississipi statute that bars most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy</a>. It also remains to be seen how further restrictions on reproductive rights will affect the 2022 midterms — threats to the health care status quo <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09615-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped Democrats in 2018</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X11433768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurt them back in 2010</a>. But regardless of how the court rules, the public’s strongly held views about abortion make it an unusually powerful issue in American politics — one that voters <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3694284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have even switched parties over in the past</a>. Any increased importance of abortion to Democratic voters, then, will likely be a boon to the party’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely chances</a> of retaining its slim congressional majorities after the 2022 midterm elections.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The number of U.S. representatives not seeking reelection is now up to 19. Since <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-all-those-house-retirements-mean-for-democrats-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last update</a>, GOP Rep. Anthony Gonzalez bowed out in the face of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-will-survive-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican revolt in his district over his vote to impeach former President Donald Trump</a>, and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass announced her intention to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-27/rep-karen-bass-officially-launches-la-mayor-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for mayor of Los Angeles</a> in 2022. And just on Tuesday, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth announced he would <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/12/kentucky-democratic-rep-john-yarmuth-not-run-reelection/6103932001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retire from elected office</a> as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">House retirements are one metric we’re watching to give us a clue as to how the 2022 midterms will unfold, but on the surface at least, it doesn’t look like either party has an advantage in this regard: 10 Democrats are retiring compared with nine Republicans. However, when you dig into the specific reasons that are likely behind each retirement, it does look like Democrats are more worried than Republicans.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At this stage, six of the Republicans are leaving the House to run for another office. Of the other three, Gonzalez is probably leaving because he would have a hard time winning his Republican primary, Rep. Tom Reed appeared to retire in response to his <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/gop-us-rep-tom-reed-to-retire-after-sexual-misconduct-accusation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexual harassment scandal</a>, and Rep. Kevin Brady said he is leaving partly because he is <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/14/kevin-brady-congress-texas-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">term-limited out of his position</a> as top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. Arguably, Reed and Rep. Lee Zeldin, who is running for governor, also decided to retire given Democrats’ control of redistricting in their home state of New York (which means they could be running on bluer turf next year). But considering they also had other factors playing into their retirements, one can argue at this point that no Republicans are retiring <em>primarily</em> out of fear of losing their general election next year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Retiring Democrats, however, appear to be more motivated by electoral concerns. Only five of the 10 retiring Democrats are running for another office, while four currently represent swing seats: Reps. Filemon Vela, Ann Kirkpatrick, Cheri Bustos and Ron Kind. And only Vela’s seat is likely to be made safely Democratic in redistricting, although he didn’t know that when he announced he was retiring. It’s reasonable, therefore, to theorize that fear of losing reelection was a key factor in their decisions to retire. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 10th retiring Democrat is Yarmuth, who currently represents a safely blue seat anchored by Louisville, Kentucky. But he may be retiring out of fear of losing reelection, too. That’s because Republicans, who control the redistricting process in Kentucky, could <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/06/republicans-redistricting-doom-democrats-498232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate his seat</a> by giving slices of his dark-blue 3rd District to neighboring red districts that can absorb more Democratic voters without becoming competitive — a gerrymandering technique known as “cracking.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/kentucky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a> hasn’t begun the redistricting process yet (at least publicly), so we don’t yet know with certainty what its new map will look like. Yarmuth’s retirement, though, could suggest that he expected Republicans to force him out. But even if they hadn’t and the 3rd District remained intact, Yarmuth may have still retired for political reasons: He is currently chair of the House Budget Committee, but he stands to lose that considerable power if Republicans take back control of the House in 2022. His retirement may indicate that he’s not optimistic about Democrats’ chances next year. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-1346.1999.tb00521.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political science research</a> has found that politicians are more likely to retire when they see a bad political environment for their party on the horizon.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news for Democrats is that politicians make bad pundits: There has historically been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-recent-rush-of-gop-retirements-is-good-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak relationship</a> between which party sees the most retirements and which party does poorly the subsequent election. But the bad news for Democrats is that, whatever the specific motivation of Yarmuth’s retirement, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history is clearly on the side</a> of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans having a strong performance</a> in the 2022 midterms.</p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): President Biden’s approval ratings are underwater — 49.2 percent disapprove of the job he is doing as president while 44.6 percent approve, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/biden-approval-rating-2-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This has been true for a while now, too. Since Aug. 30, more Americans have disapproved of Biden than have approved of him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, let’s tackle Biden’s declining approval rating in three parts. First, what do we know about why his approval rating has dipped? Second, how should we think about this current dip? That is, is it unusually large or actually pretty normal? And, finally, how much do presidents’ approval ratings matter, especially at this point in their presidency?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OK, first up, why has Biden’s approval rating dipped?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/government-regulate-facebook-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80528845</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): Given the timing, the two biggest things that have contributed to this decline appear to be Biden’s handling of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/bidens-approval-rating-on-handling-of-covid-and-economy-fall-in-latest-cnbc-all-america-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the COVID-19 pandemic</a> — specifically, how the situation has gotten worse due to the delta variant — and his administration’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/02/1033433959/biden-approval-rating-afghanistan-withdrawal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’d assume, though, that COVID-19 is likely to have a bigger impact on Biden in the long term because Afghanistan has largely faded from the news …</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1832" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RAKICH-BIDEN-APPROVAL-DOWN-1-DESKTOP@2x-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">… and the pandemic affects so much more, including the economy — and Biden’s ratings on the economy were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-only-on-ap-4dafe5b7a4adf2502280bb23b775af07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never super-high to begin with</a>. The delta variant itself, including its impact on people’s quality of life and on the economy — coupled with <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/566297-poll-inflation-named-as-top-economic-concern-among-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fears of inflation</a> — has hurt Biden’s standing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): Yeah, Alex, it’s clearly a range of factors. Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already slipping</a> before Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, for instance, as the chart above shows.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I agree that the rise of the delta variant has likely played the biggest role, though. America went from <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavirus/long-island-coronavirus-update-1.50285021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feeling like the pandemic was behind it</a> in early summer to experiencing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-highest caseload of the pandemic</a> by September. And Biden’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval and disapproval ratings on the coronavirus</a> dipped from 62 percent and 33 percent, respectively, on July 1 to 49.6 percent and 42.0 percent today.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1495" height="564" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-11-at-3.31.05-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That said, I can’t shake the feeling that, if it hadn’t been for the delta variant or the coronavirus, something else would have caused a decline in Biden’s ratings. Presidents’ approval ratings <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to dip in the summer of their first year</a> as the honeymoon period wears off and people start to notice the problems that are still around them.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): Right, it’s possible that the situation in Afghanistan served as an inflection point. People who were already beginning to sour on Biden went ahead and said, “OK, that’s it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, I agree with that, Geoffrey. The decline in his approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really accelerated</a> after the fall of Kabul. My theory is that, for the first six months of Biden’s term, many Americans were enjoying the sense of calm that had fallen over the government after four tumultuous years under former President Donald Trump — and approved of Biden because, to them, he represented a more competent leader. But Afghanistan, and also the delta variant, shattered that calm and raised questions about whether Biden really was that competent after all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> There was also evidence that, prior to the delta variant’s peak, Biden’s approval rating had <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/04/biden-approval-independents-covid-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already been dipping among independents</a>, so it certainly seems as if there’s no one answer for why Biden’s numbers have dropped.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How big a deal is this slump, though? For over a month now, more Americans have disapproved of Biden than have approved of him. Is that unusual at this point in a president’s term?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nraki</strong><strong>ch:</strong> Looking at the past several decades, it’s unusual. Only two other presidents since 1945 have had net negative approval ratings at this point in their terms: Gerald Ford (-9.1 points) and Trump (-18.2 points), and only one other president was below water at any point in his first 265 days (Bill Clinton).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect Biden to match the average approval rating of presidents at this point in their terms, which is 61 percent. American politics is more polarized now than at any other point in the past 80 years, so recent presidents have tended to have approval ratings closer to 50-50 at this point. In that sense, Biden should be graded on somewhat of a curve — but even then, he’s still doing worse than former President Barack Obama (+12.1 points) on Oct. 11, 2009.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Yeah, everyone expected Biden’s approval rating to drop at some point because every president except for Trump has benefited from a honeymoon period of above-average approval ratings when they first assumed the presidency. Those honeymoon periods invariably end.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But certain things like the COVID-19 pandemic, immigration and Afghanistan probably accelerated the disapproval numbers we’re seeing now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> For what it’s worth, though, Biden also started out at a lower number to begin with, undoubtedly in part because of how polarized our political environment is, as Nathaniel said. Biden has had <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329384/presidential-approval-ratings-joe-biden.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an approval rating above 90 percent among Democrats</a>, but his approval among Republicans has been, at best, around 20 percent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-approval-rating-has-barely-budged-in-his-first-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in some polls</a>, and more like 10 percent in others.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That polarization obviously also contributed to Trump’s circumstances. And because of it, some of the comparisons to presidents further back in time are harder to make. Nowadays, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-should-we-expect-of-bidens-approval-rating-in-the-first-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Americans no longer tend</a> to give a new president from the other party some early benefit of the doubt. For instance, John F. Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower both started their presidencies with approval ratings around 70 percent or higher. That’s not happening again anytime soon.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Right, I think the days of a president getting a 70 percent approval rating right out of the gate are clearly over. But we saw early on that Biden still had very low disapproval ratings — as low as 34 percent at one point. So, I think some people — specifically, Trump voters — were giving Biden the benefit of the doubt. But they eventually returned to their partisan corners. You can see how Biden’s disapproval rating has inched up for basically his whole term, though the rate of increase accelerated in August.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> On that note, we’ve found that presidents’ approval ratings <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to revert to the mean</a>, and at least since Obama, these ratings have been pretty steady, moving within a fairly narrow band. Can the same be said of Biden at this point? Or is it a big deal that his approval rating has dipped by as much as it has for as long as it has? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> It’s definitely something his administration (and all Democrats) will have to account for, especially as we get closer to next year’s midterm elections. I’d imagine that most Democrats seeking office right now are wondering this: “How do I engage my base without having an obvious bogeyman (Trump) to point to or a popular standard-bearer (Biden) to hitch my star to?” And what legislative victories will they be able to point to next year? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this probably puts more pressure on the Biden administration to figure things out with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/wall-street-says-to-prep-for-infrastructure-and-budget-reconciliations-bills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the infrastructure and reconciliation bills</a>. I’m skeptical that passing either bill will significantly change Democrats’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall midterm outlook</a>, but doing so could shore up some enthusiasm among his base — which Biden <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/21/voter-enthusiasm-midterms-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could certainly use right now</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Biden’s approval has actually been pretty steady compared with that of past presidents in their early days. If you look at the middle-50 percent range of daily average approval ratings in FiveThirtyEight’s approval data for presidents in their first nine or so months, Biden and Trump have seen the least variation of any of them, with less than a 4 percentage point difference between the high and low ends of that middle-50 percent. More broadly, Biden’s approval rating has dropped as low as 44 percent, but even then, the range between his highest and lowest marks is only 11 points — the same went for Trump — while Obama and Clinton had differences of 17 and 24 points, respectively. (George W. Bush’s approval skyrocketed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, making him a less useful comparison.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Do we have a sense of how strong some of this opposition to Biden now is? The Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter had <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/intensity-opposition-biden-rises-solid-support-drops-august" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written earlier in September</a> that not only was Biden struggling with more Americans disapproving of the job he was doing as president, but more Americans were <em>strongly</em> disapproving of it. Is this still the case? What does that mean if some of the opposition is so baked in?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes. Just as with Trump, the vast majority of those who dislike Biden do so with a passion. In an average of polls conducted entirely in October so far, 42 percent of respondents <em>strongly</em> disapproved of his job performance, while only 10 percent<em> somewhat</em> disapproved. And his strong disapproval numbers are on the rise. Back in May, his average strong disapproval rating was only 32 percent, while his average somewhat disapproval rating was still 10 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">(Of course, it’s probably that some people went from approving of Biden to somewhat disapproving of him, and others went from somewhat disapproving of him to strongly disapproving of him. But regardless, it’s not a good trend for him.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Of the possible reasons Biden’s approval rating has slumped, you all seem to agree that his handling of the pandemic might be his biggest liability. Does that mean if the pandemic turns a corner in the U.S. — as it’s showing signs of doing — that we should expect Biden’s numbers to bounce back?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I think probably? It seems likely that, in the best-case scenario where the pandemic goes away completely, everyone would be extremely happy, and happy people tend to like their presidents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I think so too. At least among some constituencies. But I’m not sure that’ll happen, namely because we’re seeing some of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vaccine-hesitancy-is-still-strong-in-many-covid-19-battered-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest vaccine-hesitancy rates in Republican-led states</a>, and it’s Republicans, not Democrats, who have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/20/vaccine-hesitant-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most skeptical of vaccines and mask-wearing</a>. I’m not quite sure what Biden can do to combat that — it may not be something within his power to change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I wouldn’t expect an improving COVID-19 picture to solve all Biden’s problems either, as the pandemic isn’t the only thing tanking his approval now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> If the public thinks things are going better, then sure, there’ll be some uptick. I wouldn’t expect many Republicans to approve of Biden, but it could cause his numbers among independents and Democrats to go back up some.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nra</strong><strong>kich:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/us/politics/biden-approval-ratings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate Cohn at The New York Times</a> found that much of the dip in Biden’s approval has been driven by historically Democratic voting blocs. Those groups might come back to the fold if happy times get here again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Yeah, Nathaniel, some research also suggests that Biden’s standing among Black voters isn’t too great right now. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-falling-poll-numbers-georgia/2021/10/10/3606c99e-2002-11ec-8200-5e3fd4c49f5e_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dove into this more</a>, but essentially, a Black man in Georgia who worked to help elect Biden in 2020 argued that the president’s lack of progress on police reform, a $15 minimum wage and voting-rights legislation might make it harder for him to appeal to Black voters in future elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Obviously, Black voters are a key Democratic constituency, so this could have huge ramifications for Biden. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/22/biden-black-voters-vaccine-mandate-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll from September</a> also seemed to show that some Black voters were turned off by Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine mandate</a>. Per the survey, Biden’s net approval rating dropped 12 points among Black voters. Among unvaccinated Black voters, there was a 17-point drop.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It’ll be interesting to see how long attrition among Democrats lasts given how polarized our politics are. But one reason we cover president’s approval ratings so extensively is that they can be useful for understanding a president’s reelection chances or how his party might fare in the midterms. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What does Biden’s approval rating tell us at this point? And what will you be watching moving forward?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> It’s probably too early to draw any big conclusions from Biden’s approval numbers now. But past elections indicate that the severity of midterm losses loosely correlates with the popularity of the president. Here’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-up-republican-house-chances-are-down-does-that-make-any-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a chart FiveThirtyEight published</a> in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, when Trump was unpopular and Republicans went on to lose the House:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="936" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SILVER-EU1022-1022-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">To simplify things a bit, Gallup found <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/141812/avg-midterm-seat-loss-presidents-below-approval.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2010</a> that when postwar presidents had an approval rating of 50 percent or more around the time of a midterm election, their party lost an average of only 14 seats in the House. But if a president’s approval rating was any lower than 50 percent, the average loss was 36 seats. Using more recent data, from 1970 to 2014, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-midterm-elections-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg put the average loss</a> at 33 seats for presidents with approval ratings below 50 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fifty percent isn’t some magic inflection point. But, all else being equal, the more popular Biden is come election time in 2022, the better congressional Democrats’ prospects will be.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I think there’s still time for Biden’s approval ratings to recover, but (i) whether that happens and (ii) by how much will have a big impact on how his party fares in both 2022 and 2024. I’ll be watching Biden’s approval among voters of color specifically, though, and whether Republicans use that to try to build on <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their gains with Black and Hispanic voters</a> in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, if Biden has the same approval rating in November 2022 as he does now, Democrats will clearly be toast in the midterms. But there is ample time for it to either get better or get worse before then, so I don’t think the numbers mean much for now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, Democrats shouldn’t feel like they just have to get Biden’s approval rating back above 50 percent to avoid midterm losses. The president’s party loses seats in all but the most popular presidencies. The only recent presidents who gained House seats in a midterm election, Bill Clinton in 1998 and George W. Bush in 2002, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had approval ratings in the 60s</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, basically, I think Republicans will gain seats in 2022, but I think it’s too early to tell how many.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> To Nathaniel’s point, it’s nearly impossible to imagine circumstances where Biden’s approval will top 60 percent in this polarized political environment. Perhaps the target figure should be more like 55 percent now because the band of possibilities for presidential approval has narrowed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, it will be challenging for Biden to even get back there to help Democrats hold or even gain ground. Of course, this is mostly about the House, which is a truly national election with all 435 seats up. But the Senate is harder to nail down in some ways because only about one-third of it is up in 2022, so the national political environment doesn’t have as much of a 1:1 effect on outcomes there. Take 2018, for example: Trump was way underwater and Republicans lost the House, but they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-state-democrats-became-an-endangered-species-in-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actually gained ground in the Senate</a> because Democrats <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/2018-senate-democrats-are-very-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to defend a sizable number of seats in red states</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put another way, the relationship between presidential approval and seat loss for the president’s party is not as highly correlated in the Senate as it is in the House. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, the Senate voted to temporarily raise the debt ceiling through early December, but the political conflict over a longer-term increase continues.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Most Democrats in Congress are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-house-democrats-may-be-more-united-than-they-seem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">united around the Democratic agenda</a>, but a small number of senators and representatives have so far been able to hold up its passage. “I need 50 votes in the Senate. I have 48,” President Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-agenda-liberals-jayapal/2021/10/05/0caa2da0-25e0-11ec-8d53-67cfb452aa60_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said last week</a>, regarding his social spending bill. As for who is standing in the way, his blame was clear: “Two. Two people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those two people are Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. The two moderates have forced Democrats to water down several priorities (such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/14/1036812609/senate-democrats-offer-a-new-voting-bill-but-a-gop-filibuster-likely-blocks-the-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election reform</a> and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion budget bill</a>) and are blocking more ambitious reforms entirely (such as abolishing the filibuster). But while congressional observers — from the commander-in-chief on down — usually mention Manchin and Sinema in the same sentence, it’s a mistake to lump together their resistance to their party’s priorities. Manchin’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centrism is unsurprising</a>: He has been a conservative Democrat his entire career, and his home state of West Virginia is so red that it might be politically impossible for him to move left, even if he wanted to. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But neither is true of Sinema. Once a staunch progressive, Arizona’s senior senator has taken a hard turn to the right. On the surface, that appears to have been an effort to make her more electable by courting moderate and conservative voters. If so, she may have overcompensated: Arizona is no West Virginia, and no other swing-state senator has vexed Democratic leadership so thoroughly. In fact, Sinema’s established such a firm anti-progressive reputation that she may have lost the support of enough <em>Democrats</em> to endanger her reelection just the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sinema’s resistance to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/kyrsten-sinema-minimum-wage-thumbs-down.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core pieces</a> of her <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2021/06/22/sinema-defends-filibuster-on-same-day-its-used-to-stall-voting-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">party’s agenda</a> may seem puzzling from an electoral perspective, and it’s possible that a motivation other than winning reelection is behind her contrarianism (more on that later). But it’s also possible that she’s striking the ideal strategic balance between primary and general election electability.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, is Sinema right?</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Sinema began her political career as a self-described “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/kyrsten-sinema-a-success-story-like-nobody-elses/2013/01/02/d31fadaa-5382-11e2-a613-ec8d394535c6_story.html?utm_term=.24b88e7bc58a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prada socialist</a>.” Originally a member of the Arizona Green Party, she was a vocal liberal activist who organized <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/kfile-kyrsten-sinema-activist-past/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-war protests</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-road-to-the-senate-runs-straight-through-trump-country-1520266957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marches for immigrants’ rights</a>. After a failed bid for the Arizona state legislature in 2002, she switched to the Democratic Party and went on to serve three terms in the state House and one in the state Senate. According to <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/GZJOT3&amp;version=1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideology scores for state legislators</a> calculated by political scientists Boris Shor and Nolan McCarty, she was the House’s second- or third-most liberal member during her tenure, and the Senate’s single most liberal member in 2011-12.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But when she was elected to the U.S. Congress in 2012, a switch flipped. She immediately became the <a href="https://voteview.com/person/21300/kyrsten-sinema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most conservative Democrat</a> in the House of Representatives, according to DW-Nominate, which uses voting records to quantify the ideology of every member of Congress on a scale from 1 (most conservative) to -1 (most liberal). She has a career DW-Nominate score of -0.103, which currently makes her the second-most conservative Democrat in the Senate, after Manchin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conventional wisdom is that Sinema rushed toward the center for electoral reasons, as she moved from representing a solidly blue electorate to purpler ones. Former President Obama carried her state legislative seat by 26 percentage points in 2008 (according to local analyst Aseem Chandi), but Obama carried her congressional seat by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 5 points</a> in 2012. While her district became more safely Democratic later in her House career, she may have already been laying the groundwork for her Senate run. “Kyrsten has always had her eyes on a larger electorate,” Tempe City Councilwoman Lauren Kuby <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/us/politics/kyrsten-sinema-arizona.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The New York Times</a> in 2018. (Tempe is a city in Sinema’s old district.) And to win a statewide campaign, Sinema needed to win over even more swing voters: Former President Trump carried Arizona by almost <a href="https://apps.azsos.gov/election/2016/General/Official%20Signed%20State%20Canvass.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 points</a> in 2016. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But while no one denies that Arizona is a tough state for Democrats to win, it’s not nearly as tough as Manchin’s West Virginia, which Trump carried by a whopping <a href="https://services.sos.wv.gov/apps/elections/results/results.aspx?year=2016&amp;eid=23&amp;county=Statewide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 points</a> in 2016. West Virginia is no swing state; it’s one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddest states in the entire country</a>. And while six non-Sinema Democrats have won a statewide election in Arizona since 2018 — including Biden in 2020<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other five are Sen. Mark Kelly, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman and Corporation Commissioners Sandra Kennedy and Anna Tovar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> — Manchin is the only Democratic statewide elected official left in West Virginia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Democrats are lucky that Manchin is in the Senate at all. Because of how red West Virginia is, a typical senator from the state would almost certainly be a Republican.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if so, that would hand Republicans control of the Senate, considering Democrats have the majority now only by dint of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> Indeed, based on Trump’s margin in West Virginia in 2016, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-the-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’d expect</a> that a generic replacement for Manchin would have voted in line with Trump’s position 89.3 percent of the time during his presidency. Manchin, though, voted with Trump just <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/joe-manchin-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50.4 percent</a> of the time — a lot for a Democrat, but not a lot considering the partisanship of his home state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using the same methodology, we’d have expected a generic replacement for Sinema to vote with Trump just 39.8 percent of the time — a reflection of the purpler partisanship of her state and her congressional district at the time. Yet Sinema voted with him <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/kyrsten-sinema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50.4 percent</a> of the time too, as much as Manchin. That made her the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only Democratic senator</a> who voted with Trump significantly<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 5 percentage points more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> <em>more often</em> than expected based on the politics of senators’ states. Her voting record during the Trump years looked more like Manchin’s, Sen. Joe Donnelly’s, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp’s or Sen. Claire McCaskill’s — all Democrats from substantially redder states.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current congress</a>, Sinema has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/kyrsten-sinema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted perfectly in line</a> with the Biden administration and her party on bills <em>that came up for a vote</em>. But as we’ve seen with negotiations over the reconciliation bill and more, that leaves a lot out. Sinema still ranks as more ideologically conservative than other Democratic senators from once-red-but-trending-blue states: <a href="https://voteview.com/person/42103/thomas-jonathan-jon-ossoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Ossoff</a> (who has a DW-Nominate score of -0.448 so far) and <a href="https://voteview.com/person/42105/raphael-gamaliel-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raphael Warnock</a> (-0.380) of Georgia, and even her fellow Arizonan, <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41905/mark-edward-kelly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Kelly</a> (-0.186).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Sinema is acting moderate for electoral reasons, she clearly disagrees with the conventional wisdom about <em>how</em> moderate a swing-state senator needs to be. On one hand, maybe she has a point: Donnelly, Heitkamp and McCaskill all lost reelection in 2018, as did Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida is about as purple as Arizona but who voted with Trump less often than Sinema did. All four voted with Trump significantly less often than we’d have expected given the partisanship of their state, suggesting that Sinema’s strategy of hewing closer to expectations might have been smarter. (Although this doesn’t justify her approach of voting with Trump <em>more</em> often than expected.) On the other hand, political science research has found that candidates and congressional aides are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/05/why-kyrsten-sinemas-political-position-is-so-baffling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really bad at assessing where voters stand on the issues</a>. One <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/miller-stokes/08_MillerStokes_BroockmanSkovron.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 study</a> found that politicians overestimated by several percentage points how conservative their constituents were, in direct contradiction of Sinema’s entire theory of the case.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Maybe Sinema just figures she can’t be too careful. But if that’s the case, she’ll just win reelection in a landslide, right? Perhaps — but there are also downsides to moving too far to the center. For every inch of ground she gains with swing voters by demonstrating her independence from the Democratic Party, she risks alienating the Democratic base. And it’s not at all clear whether that’s a winning electoral tradeoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a convenient natural experiment, an <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/kelly-leads-in-all-head-to-head-matchups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights poll</a> from early September asked Arizona registered voters their opinions of Sinema and Kelly, who serves as a kind of control variable for Sinema: a Democratic senator from Arizona who <em>isn’t</em> a thorn in his party’s side. Accounting for the poll’s margin of error, the two had virtually identical favorable and unfavorable ratings: 46 percent to 39 percent for Sinema, 47 percent to 43 percent for Kelly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that topline similarity obscured major differences in their underlying coalitions. Kelly had very conventional party splits in his popularity: Democrats viewed him favorably, 80 percent to 11 percent, while Republicans viewed him unfavorably, 73 percent to 20 percent. Sinema’s heterodoxy, though, earned her a much more lukewarm rating among Democrats: 56 percent favorable, 30 percent unfavorable. At the same time, it endeared her to Republicans, an impressive 40 percent of whom had a favorable opinion of her (versus 48 percent who had an unfavorable opinion). Independents, though, rated the two of them virtually the same.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sinema is presumably betting that Democrats who dislike her will vote for her regardless, <em>and</em> that at least some Republicans who like her will vote for her, too. It’s not an outlandish notion: Those liberal Democrats, as frustrated as they are at Sinema, will probably find her Republican opponent more odious, and while there aren’t a lot of voters who can be persuaded to cross party lines, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-many-swing-voters-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they do exist</a>. But it’s just as possible that some of those Democratic disapprovers will be so frustrated with Sinema that they’ll skip voting in the Senate race. And just because a Republican voter likes Sinema doesn’t mean they’ll choose her over a candidate of their own party. Since Sinema is next up for reelection in 2024, she’ll be asking those voters to cast ballots for her at the same time as they are very likely voting for the Republican presidential candidate. That’s a big ask considering <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how few voters split their tickets</a> in this highly polarized era. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Democratic opinion of Sinema sinks low enough, she could even be in danger of losing in a primary. Progressives are already <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/could-sen-kyrsten-sinema-face-primary-these-progressives-are-trying-n1280392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gearing up to challenge her</a>; two groups have formed to help fund her eventual opponents, and another is hoping to recruit progressive Rep. Ruben Gallego to run against her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s extremely rare for elected incumbent senators to lose their primaries. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X97S6hUby6PPHAMoEwvAxkAUo8EUwLk8xMosx4hVd8c/htmlview?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Only five have done so this century</a>: Republican Sen. Bob Smith in 2002, Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman in 2006, Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski in 2010<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieberman and Murkowski, however, went on to win their general elections as independents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> and Republican Sen. Richard Lugar in 2012.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, appointed Sen. Luther Strange lost the Alabama Republican primary in 2017, and Sen. Bob Bennett lost renomination at the Utah Republican convention in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> But it’s also rare for incumbent senators to poll as poorly among their own party’s voters as Sinema does. In addition to the OH Predictive Insights poll, Democratic registered voters in Arizona gave her a 46 percent favorable rating and a 40 percent unfavorable rating in a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/04/sinema-manchin-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> survey conducted across July, August and September.

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Sinema’s primary is still almost three years away, so there is plenty of time for her numbers to improve — if she lets them. But if nothing changes, she could be vulnerable. And even if she prevails, a tough primary could make it harder to win the general election by sapping her resources and creating Democratic disunity. Arizona’s primary is relatively late on the calendar (August), which may not give primary winners enough time to recover and run a strong general election campaign. (Then-Rep. Martha McSally’s campaign <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2018/11/28/martha-mcsally-campaign-not-her-fault-lost-kyrsten-sinema/2138224002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partly blamed</a> her tough Republican primary for her loss to Sinema in the 2018 general election.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s the right balance for Sinema — or any senator, really — to strike between concern for the primary and concern for the general? It may depend on the partisanship of their state. The table below lists all the elected incumbent senators who have lost reelection since 2000 in either a primary or general election. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all the incumbents who lost primaries represented states that leaned toward their party (though some, like Specter and Smith, did represent swing states). All the incumbents who lost reelection on the opposite party’s home turf did so in the general.</p>

 <footer><p>*Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean. In this case, positive numbers are toward the senator’s party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">While Arizona is a swing state, it is still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly Republican-leaning</a>. (Biden carried it by only a hair in 2020, suggesting that he would have lost there if the national environment hadn’t been so Democratic-leaning.) So perhaps Sinema is right not to fear a primary challenge; it would be unprecedented in recent history for someone in her position to lose renomination. Then again, few politicians have pushed the envelope of what their base will tolerate as much as Sinema has. It’s an obvious point, but while Arizona might be light red overall, the Democratic primary electorate will be mostly Democrats and Democratic leaners — a group that, in Arizona, self-identifies as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/primaries-caucuses/entrance-and-exit-polls/arizona/democratic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61 percent liberal and only 33 percent moderate</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reason that Democratic senators in red states and Republican senators in blue states tend not to lose their primaries isn’t because members of the opposite party are voting for them in the primary; it’s more that voters are afraid to throw them out, or that opponents are afraid to challenge them, lest it endanger the party’s hold on the seat in the general election. But Sinema is putting to the test whether this concern outweighs the grassroots dissent against her. That’s a big risk.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Up to now, we haven’t questioned the assumption that Sinema’s maverickness is motivated by a desire to win elections. But as we’ve seen, if that’s Sinema’s goal, her strategy for attaining it is unconventional at best and counterproductive at worst. That naturally raises one final question: If not winning reelection, what else could be motivating Sinema?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may be her donors. In a September report, liberal group Accountable.US found that Sinema raised <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163745/kyrsten-sinema-corporate-donations-chamber-commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least $923,065</a> from business interests that opposed Biden’s budget reconciliation plan, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a longtime Sinema ally. She’s also been the recipient of large donations from the <a href="https://khn.org/news/a-senator-from-arizona-emerges-as-a-pharma-favorite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmaceutical industry</a>, which <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163745/kyrsten-sinema-corporate-donations-chamber-commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critics have blamed</a> for her opposition to letting Medicare negotiate down drug costs. Of course, it’s possible that the causation is reversed — that such interest groups are donating to her because they like her positions on these issues. That said, <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/out-of-district_contributors_web_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study</a> found that politicians <em>did</em> adjust their positions based on donor preferences. “When the national donor base prefers a different outcome than a representative’s general and primary electorates,” the authors wrote, “overwhelmingly the member chooses the donor-favored position.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another explanation for Sinema’s centrism could be that she genuinely believes in it. In her 2009 book “Unite and Conquer,” Sinema <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-not-progressive_n_5bdca881e4b09d43e31edfa3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> how she was initially frustrated at her inability to get things done in the state legislature — so she decided to stop being a “bomb-thrower” and start working with Republicans. Perhaps now, after so many years of embedding with the GOP to get things done (this is the first time she has ever served in a legislative chamber controlled by Democrats), she has internalized the conservatism of her peers — and even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/29/kyrsten-sinema-arizona-democrats-060187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embraced bipartisanship as a policy goal unto itself</a>. (That would explain her fierce opposition to ending the filibuster and her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/30/politics/krysten-sinema-infrastructure-deal-backlash/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dogged negotiation</a> of a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill earlier this year.) What else, besides personal conviction, can explain why she has maintained her contrarianism in the face of <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-biden-reconciliation_n_61548b6ae4b075408bd1e9fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frustrated colleagues</a>, <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2021/10/05/protesters-confront-sinema-directly-she-calls-the-move-unacceptable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggressive protesters</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/us/kyrsten-sinema-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the potential end of her political career</a>? It could be that she really is acting on principle. Or it could be that she thinks this is her smartest move politically. Or it could be some combination of both. Unfortunately, we might never know for sure.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How Fast Is The Economy Recovering?<br>
By Julia Wolfe and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</p>
<p>For nearly a year, the economy has been on a long, exhausting slog toward post-pandemic “normalcy.” And it isn’t over yet.</p>
<p>This page — which we plan to update every month — will tell us how far we still have to go before the economy is back where it was before the pandemic shut down much of American life.</p>
<p>We have made significant progress, of course: After hitting the highest level of unemployment the country has seen since the Great Depression in April, the unemployment rate has steadily fallen.</p>
<p>But as of this month, we’re still 3.2 percentage points higher than the pre-pandemic unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Change from January 2020 in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate<br>
Jan.<br>
Dec.<br>
+11.3<br>
+3.2<br>
The unemployment rate in December was 6.7%, according to the latest jobs report, unchanged from 6.7% in November.</p>
<p>Crucially, the recovery isn’t affecting all workers equally. Just as Black and Hispanic communities have struggled with higher rates of infection and death since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, communities of color are continuing to bear the brunt of high unemployment and economic insecurity, even as the overall numbers fall.</p>

Even in good times, Black unemployment often hovers at levels much higher than for white Americans. But the pandemic has exacerbated that stubborn inequality, and now we’re in the midst of a profoundly unequal economic crisis. Low-wage workers — who are disproportionately likely to be Black and Hispanic — have been hardest hit by the pandemic because they generally work in sectors, like retail and hospitality, where their work can’t be done from home. Those workplaces pose significant public health risks in a pandemic, and have been subjected to full or partial shutdowns as infections ebb and flow.</p>
<p>As a result, we’re much closer to economic normalcy in sectors like construction and professional and business services than we are in sectors like leisure and hospitality.</p>

Some sectors have been able to adjust (more or less) to the realities of the pandemic, but others, like leisure and hospitality and education and health services, have left their workers in a painful no-win situation. They face precarious employment, with temporary furloughs or permanent layoffs always on the horizon, plus the unenviable prospect of going to work every day with the risk of infection hanging over their heads.</p>
<p>These disparities are important to remember because even when employment appears to be approaching pre-pandemic normalcy, a lot of people aren’t part of that economic rebound — and those workers are still disproportionately likely to be people of color, young and low-wage.</p>
<p>Check back next month for an update on how close — or far — we are to the levels of unemployment we saw before the pandemic.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">As President Biden and other Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/30/us/government-shutdown-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work to pass</a> an omnibus budget bill, members of the party are at odds over the topline spending number, with figures ranging between <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/30/manchin-proposed-15t-topline-number-to-schumer-this-summer-514803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 trillion</a> to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/budget-reconciliation-bill-build-back-better-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion</a>. Biden has said it’s likely the bill <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-floats-roughly-2-trillion-price-tag-for-reconciliation-08740ed0-2db3-4ce7-8088-2a1d36644e38.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will end up in the $2 trillion range</a>, which means progressives’ priorities will surely be shrunk, cut or reworked. Progressive lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/podcasts/the-daily/biden-infrastructure-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have signaled</a> that they’re open to compromise, but some are warning that there’s <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/democrats-look-to-break-impasse-on-spending-climate-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least one area</a> they’ll refuse to give ground on: climate-related provisions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Climate change could thus prove to be one of the main sticking points between progressives and centrists in the party. From the progressives’ point of view, the reconciliation bill <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/15/1036954961/congress-is-debating-its-biggest-climate-change-bill-ever-heres-whats-at-stake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be the federal government’s best shot</a> at tackling the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/20/climate-crisis-environment-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly escalating climate crisis</a> in the near future. And New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that climate provisions are not something Congress can “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-on-face-the-nation-october-3-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kick down the line</a>.” Meanwhile, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, one of the key centrists needed to pass the bill who has already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-is-so-willing-and-able-to-block-his-partys-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully blocked</a> some of Biden’s priority items, has said that he <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/manchin-slams-3-5t-plan-says-climate-bill-makes-no-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposes the current bill’s primary climate provision</a>: paying utilities to switch to clean energy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So where does the public stand on combating climate change? Even before <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/07/24/amid-summer-fire-floods-moment-truth-climate-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent devastating weather events</a>, Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have long said</a> that the federal government wasn’t doing enough. And polls now suggest that public opinion is more on the side of progressives. But the big caveat here is how Americans prioritize action on climate change versus other issues.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-starting-make-climate-agenda-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-78546775</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, a majority of Americans want action on climate. According to a newly released survey from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_100421/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a>, 60 percent of U.S. adults said that climate change was “very” or “extremely” important for the federal government to address. Furthermore, 56 percent of U.S. adults said climate change was a “very serious” problem — up from 41 percent in the same poll in December 2015. A recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/14/americans-are-less-concerned-but-more-divided-on-climate-change-than-people-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Pew Research Center</a> found that 60 percent of U.S. adults said they were worried about the personal impacts of climate change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/climate/republicans-climate-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become slightly more open</a> to climate proposals, but there’s still a big partisan divide on the issue. Monmouth found only 30 percent of Republicans said they supported government action on climate change, versus 92 percent of Democrats. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355427/americans-concerned-global-warming.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup survey</a> released earlier this week yielded similar results. Combining survey data from 2017 to 2021, Gallup found that 65 percent of U.S. adults said they “worry a great deal” or a “fair amount” about global warming. Among Democrats, that number jumped to 91 percent; among Republicans, it was only 32 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other surveys, though, suggest there’s widespread support for enacting specific federal policies to combat climate change. Per a 2020 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Pew</a>, 79 percent of U.S. adults said their country should prioritize developing alternative sources of energy. Seventy-eight percent of Republicans and 90 percent of Democrats supported providing businesses with a tax credit if they developed carbon capture/storage, while 64 percent of Republicans and 93 percent of Democrats said they wanted tougher restrictions on carbon emissions from power plants. In fact, a majority of Republicans — and an overwhelming majority of Democrats — favored all five climate policies that Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/ps_2020-06-23_government-and-climate_00-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked about</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, recent research has also shown that the budget bill’s climate-related proposals are wildly popular with the public. According to <a href="https://publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Reconciliation_Budget_Report_0921.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study from the University of Maryland</a>, which analyzed several polls on proposals in the reconciliation budget, 85 percent of registered voters supported reestablishing the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/09/16/civilian-climate-corps-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> and 83 percent supported the creation of a jobs program hiring unemployed coal workers to close down coal mines and remediate the landscape.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But here’s the catch: While Americans believe tackling climate change is important, that doesn’t mean they see it as the<em> most</em> important issue. In the Monmouth survey mentioned earlier, issues like jobs and unemployment (77 percent), the COVID-19 pandemic (72 percent) and racial inequality (65 percent) topped Americans’ list of “extremely important” or “very important” concerns for the federal government to address. A <a href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/94/2021/09/Politico-HSPH-Sept-Oct-2021-poll-report-topline-092821.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Harvard poll</a> conducted in mid-September found that climate-related spending did not land in the top five “extremely important” issues that U.S. adults wanted included in the budget bill. The highest-priority climate-related issue — increasing spending on conservation efforts to curb wildfires and carbon emissions — came in at sixth place, while a policy to encourage people to buy electric cars ranked dead last in the list of 20 priorities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Politics to address climate change will need to overcome other obstacles as well. The oil and gas industry is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/climate/api-exxon-biden-climate-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lobbying against some of the bill’s</a> climate-related proposals, for example. And Manchin, who will need to sign off on the bill’s final language, represents West Virginia, which is among the nation’s top producers of <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=69&amp;t=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coal</a> and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/where-our-natural-gas-comes-from.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural gas</a>. He is currently the top recipient of campaign donations from the coal, mining and oil and gas industries, per <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/joe-manchin/industries?cid=N00032838&amp;cycle=2022&amp;type=C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSecrets</a>. He also has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal financial stakes in the fossil fuel industry</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For now, though, considering that progressive Democrats successfully stopped the infrastructure bill from passing last week, it’s notable that they’re already drawing another line in the sand on the spending bill. We’ll be keeping an eye out for what gets cut and what goes into the final bill. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites </strong></h2>



<ul><li>A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/06/two-thirds-of-republicans-want-trump-to-retain-major-political-role-44-want-him-to-run-again-in-2024/">Pew Research Center survey</a> from September found that 67 percent of Republicans would like to see former President Donald Trump remain as a major national political figure. That’s up 10 percentage points from a poll conducted by Pew just after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. </li><li>A recent <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/virginia-2021-dead-heat-in-governor-and-attorney-general-race">Emerson College/Nexstar Media poll</a> showed a tied race for Virginia’s upcoming gubernatorial election, with 49 percent of likely voters supporting Democrat Terry McAuliffe and 49 percent supporting Republican Glenn Youngkin. FiveThirtyEight’s updating average of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/">Virginia governor polls</a> currently has McAuliffe at 47.5 percent<strong> </strong>and Youngkin at 45 percent.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a></li><li>Americans want to get spooky again this Halloween. Per a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/06/halloween-costumes-parties-candy-2021/">new Morning Consult poll</a>, 56 percent of adults said they planned to celebrate Halloween this year, up 14 points from those who planned to celebrate in 2020. This year’s share of celebrating adults is more in line with pre-COVID-19 levels — 57 percent of surveyed Americans said they celebrated Halloween in 2019. </li><li>A majority of Americans view both major political parties unfavorably. Per a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355280/party-favorable-ratings-near-parity-viewed-negatively.aspx">recently released Gallup poll</a>, 55 percent of surveyed adults said they had an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party and 56 percent an unfavorable view of the Republican Party. That being said, the GOP’s favorability rating (now 40 percent) increased 3 points between January and September, while the Democratic Party’s favorability (now 43 percent) dropped by 5 points during the same time period.</li><li>Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s popularity may be suffering from her opposition to the Democrats’ proposed spending bill, according to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/04/sinema-manchin-approval-rating/">a new Morning Consult poll</a>. Sinema’s approval among Arizona voters dropped 6 percentage points since the start of the year, from 48 percent to 42 percent. This drop left voter disapproval of Sinema equal to voter approval of her, at 42 percent. Sinema’s disapproval rating <em>among Democrats</em> dropped 20 points from the beginning of the year, to 40 percent now. But her disapproval among Democrats was somewhat offset by her improved approval rating among Republicans, which increased by 9 points.</li><li>As President Biden and the Democrats continue to negotiate the reconciliation bill — and hold off voting on the bipartisan infrastructure bill — approval of how Biden has handled rebuilding the country’s infrastructure has dipped, according to a new <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-09/topline-abc-biden-approval-09.29.21.pdf">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a>. A majority of Americans (55 percent) approved of Biden’s handling of U.S. infrastructure, but that’s down 7 points since August. Democrats are hoping to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill and reconciliation bill <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/schumer-aims-to-pass-biden-infrastructure-build-back-better-plans-in-october.html">by the end of October</a>.</li><li>Facebook <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids">paused its development of Instagram Kids</a> — a version of the app made specifically for children under 13 years old. The Sept. 27 pause followed the leak of internal studies — by recently revealed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043194385/whistleblowers-testimony-facebook-instagram">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> — that had found that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">Instagram was negatively affecting the mental health of teen girls</a>. For some parents, the pause of Instagram Kids may come as a relief. A recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/05/instagram-kids-social-media-polling/">Morning Consult poll</a> found that 53 percent of parents with kids aged 5 to 13 either strongly or somewhat opposed the creation of Instagram Kids. Additionally, 87 percent of those parents said they were concerned about the impact of social media on the mental health of children. </li><li>A small majority of American adults (51 percent) said there shouldn’t be more government regulation for social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Sixty-one percent of Republicans agreed with this sentiment, while 59 percent of Democrats disagreed and thought there should be more regulation of these platforms, per a recent <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us10052021_uype37.pdf">Quinnipiac University poll</a>.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

Including leaners, the poll found a 49-49 tie; without leaners, McAuliffe had 49 percent and Youngkin 48 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Over a year and a half ago, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, an estimated 767,000 people in the U.S. have died from the disease, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">120.2 million have been infected</a>. Though vaccination rates have increased and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new cases have decreased</a> in recent weeks, COVID-19 continues to affect the lives of people across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/uncontrolled-spread-scott-gottlieb/1139568341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new book</a>, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a Pfizer board member and former head of the Food and Drug Administration, argues that the U.S. was unable to control the spread of the novel coronavirus because of structural failures, and offers recommendations on how to prepare for future pandemics. In this episode of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politics podcast</a>, he joins FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver and Maggie Koerth to discuss why the U.S. was so unprepared and how much the country’s response to the public health crisis has improved since the onset of the pandemic.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The use of the debt ceiling as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-debt-deal-the-triumph-of-the-old-washington/2011/08/02/gIQARSFfqI_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative hostage</a> started in earnest in 2011, when a divided government in Washington <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/the-not-so-happy-anniversary-of-the-debt-ceiling-crisis/260458/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly caused a debt default</a>. Energized by the tea party movement, Republicans <a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/a-familiar-landmine-the-looming-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to back an increase in the debt ceiling</a> unless then-President Barack Obama agreed to budget cuts, and they also refused to raise taxes as part of a bipartisan bargain. A last-minute agreement followed, but the delay still led to a downgrade in the country’s credit rating. Yet we’ve seen <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/debt-limit-through-the-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued clashes over the cap ever since</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those conflicts have escalated further in the current round. Although Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/politics/debt-ceiling-congress-republicans.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have just about reached a deal</a> to go ahead with a simple majority vote on a short-term debt ceiling increase, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-republicans-refusing-raise-debt-ceiling/story?id=80394658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans remain intent on filibustering</a> a straight up-or-down vote on a longer-term suspension or increase of the limit in December. Democrats control the Senate, which is split 50-50, through Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote. But that’s well short of the 60 votes required by the filibuster to advance to a final vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What I see as new here is filibustering debt limit increases and forcing a Senate majority party that doesn’t have 60 seats to try to come up with some way to raise the debt ceiling — even though it doesn’t have 60 seats and can’t get any help from the minority party,” said <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/frances-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frances Lee</a>, a political scientist at Princeton University who studies congressional politics.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Failing to raise the debt limit would result in a default on U.S. debt, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/01/economy/debt-ceiling-next-steps/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could cripple the economy</a> and <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#_Hlk431978571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause terrible repercussions for everyday Americans</a>. The date the country runs out of money is quickly approaching: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/treasury-secretary-warns-calamity-congress-raise-debt-limit/story?id=80283655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> it could be as soon as Oct. 18. While the parties seem set on a short-term agreement to push that deadline back to at least December, Republicans continue to say that, for a longer-term increase, Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-play-debt-limit-brinksmanship-nation-barrels-default/story?id=80417215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must raise the cap on their own</a> using the more complex <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconciliation process</a>, which allows passage of certain fiscal legislation with only a simple majority. And, while there are paths out of this predicament, this amplified disagreement is emblematic of the dangers the debt ceiling presents to our political system, especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when partisan enmity is so high</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here, then, is a look at how we got here; what could prevent politicians from using the debt ceiling to put Congress in a political stranglehold; and why it’s unlikely that the debt ceiling will go away anytime soon.</p>

<h2><strong>How the battle over the debt ceiling escalated</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congress has always placed limits on federal debt, but it <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#established" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first established the debt ceiling</a> in 1917 over concerns about debt piling up during World War I. About two decades later, in 1939, <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20151102_RL31967_4040b7fa5a66b382fbc01594e94477dfa8bacf46.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cap came into its modern form</a> after modifications applied it to nearly all federal debt. The idea was that aggregating most debt would give the Treasury Department more flexibility to manage it while maintaining Congress’s <a href="https://history.house.gov/institution/origins-development/power-of-the-purse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">constitutionally mandated control of the nation’s finances</a>. Over time, the state of the debt ceiling has also come to symbolize the federal government’s frugality or wastefulness.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the limit’s means as a check on spending is questionable considering that the national debt <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYGFD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only gone up</a> since the late 1930s. More importantly, as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product, debt has surged since the 1980s, following a long-running decrease after World War II, as the chart below shows. In other words, the country’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> — a measure of our debt that factors in our ability to pay it off by looking at it relative to the size of the nation’s economy — has grown immensely.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Both Republicans and Democrats own the national debt  " aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z8PQ5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Who’s to blame? Well, both parties, and … circumstances. The steepest rises in debt-to-GDP ratio came during the presidencies of two Republicans (Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump) and one Democrat (Barack Obama). However, some of these increases happened partly because of crises. When Obama came into office during the Great Recession, a loss of tax revenues due to the economic downturn and a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$831 billion stimulus package</a> led to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/06/25/10-years-later-4-fiscal-policy-lessons-from-the-global-financial-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large budget deficits</a>. And in 2020, during Trump’s presidency, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/government-stimulus-efforts-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis-4799723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimulus efforts to combat</a> the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a further rise. Yet much of this was of their own making, such as the <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tax-cuts-wont-make-america-great-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax cuts passed</a> during the presidencies of Reagan and Trump that ballooned deficits and increased the national debt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s never been an easy vote, but Congress has raised the debt ceiling more than 100 times. Its history as a political tinderbox <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/146682/1/862691109.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long predates our current era</a>. “The debt ceiling has been a problem going back to the 1950s, because it’s difficult for Congress to support an increase,” said Lee. “It looks to their constituents like they are free spending, don't care about the deficit, that they're voting themselves a blank check. That's how it gets understood.” This misunderstanding of the debt ceiling -- which affects only our ability to pay what we already owe -- <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-fight-over-the-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to be a problem</a>, too, as many Americans still mistakenly believe it authorizes new spending.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s different in the latest debt-ceiling fight</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Prior to this current fight, if one party had full control but lacked 60 seats in the Senate, the minority party <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t block the majority from advancing</a> debt ceiling legislation. With a looming deal to allow a short-term increase, that has remained true -- for now. But later this year, Republican opposition may compel Democrats to raise the cap on their own <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/22/potential-fallback-for-debt-ceiling-fraught-with-complications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using reconciliation</a>, a special legislative process that requires just a simple majority but can only be used sparingly. While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/27/democrats-reject-grueling-debt-limit-514256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not unheard of</a> to increase the limit via reconciliation, having the minority <em>force</em> the majority to raise it this way is new.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/laura-blessing-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Blessing</a>, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute who studies budgetary politics, viewed this fight as potentially “a new era of just insane levels of brinkmanship” because there doesn’t appear to be any path to a bipartisan agreement on a long-term debt ceiling increase. Blessing noted that it was then-Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who came together at the last minute to salvage things in 2011. But McConnell “has changed his tune in terms of how he thinks the debt ceiling should work,” she observed, as he now argues the party in power has sole responsibility for raising it. “And there is not, at least not publicly, any sort of negotiating position that [Republicans are] using this for,” said Blessing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It seems that de facto, they're attempting to slow down the Biden administration legislative train by putting this kind of a roadblock in the works. It’s just the most dangerous roadblock that you can possibly imagine.”</p>

<h2><strong>Why it’s going to be hard to remove the debt ceiling cudgel from our politics</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we’ve seen, the debt ceiling has done little to reduce federal spending, in part because the cap affects the country’s ability to pay off already-existing financial obligations and is handled separately from legislation that actually authorizes expenditures. Additionally, the debt ceiling has provided opportunities for partisan maneuvering that can take us to the brink of default. So it’s probably past time to rethink the debt ceiling. “You've got this fiscal tool that is antiquated and can only harm people and that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22684328/us-debt-ceiling-government-shutdown-biden-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtually no other country around the world has</a>,” said Blessing. “You could procedurally blunt this.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One move would be to reinstitute some version of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-reconciliation-partisan-budget-negotiations-spending-federal-deficit-11629753688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gephardt Rule</a>, which from 1979 to 1995 linked an increase in the debt ceiling to the passage of the budget. When Congress passed its fiscal plan, it simultaneously authorized any necessary borrowing. But after the GOP captured all of Congress in the 1994 election, it mostly did away with this rule. Unfortunately, reinstating this rule might not be enough, in part because the budgetary process <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/its-not-news-congresss-budget-process-wreck-it-should-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t functioned properly</a> for years now. “The federal budget process has been broken for the past 10 years. We have not passed a budget resolution most of the time,” observed Blessing. “So even if you went back to a classic fix, that classic fix would be a problem because things have broken down so much.” In fact, after Democrats captured the House in 2018, <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/01/03/rules-package-would-renew-gephardt-rule-with-a-major-twist-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they implemented a new version of the Gephardt Rule</a> that suspends the debt limit rather than establishing a new ceiling. That hasn’t fixed things, partly because the Senate still has to approve of the suspension. Blessing said that Senate rules could also be adjusted to include something similar to the Gephardt Rule, but that could be difficult to do in such a narrowly divided chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a similar but more ambitious vein, Georgetown University law professor David Super <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/20/only-language-mcconnell-understands-is-power-act-accordingly-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has argued that</a> Senate Democrats could use a stand-alone reconciliation vote to pass legislation that directly ties the debt ceiling to whatever the national debt happens to be. And with Senate Republicans opposed to assisting a long-term debt ceiling hike, Democrats <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1445111822483345411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may indeed have to raise it</a> via reconciliation. In a bit of good news for Democrats, though, Punchbowl News <a href="https://email.punchbowl.news/t/ViewEmail/t/DD8030506F7149122540EF23F30FEDED/0D79378D1BBC29E51D419C9787CC9684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earlier this week</a> that the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that a separate reconciliation vote on the debt ceiling wouldn’t disrupt Democrats’ ongoing legislative efforts to pass a large social spending package, which is also being done via reconciliation. Democrats could try to mimic Super’s plan or raise the debt ceiling to an astronomically high number that would essentially make it meaningless for the foreseeable future. Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, chairman of the House Budget Committee, <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/debt-creativity-includes-mint-the-coin-gazillion-dollar-limit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in late September</a> that he was in favor of “eliminating the law or raising the debt limit to a gazillion dollars.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not clear whether Super’s approach or raising the debt ceiling to an extreme might be palatable to many Democrats, who may instead prefer a smaller increase. “It's a painful vote for members of Congress,” said Lee. “They don't want to have to vote for it because it makes them look irresponsible to their constituents.” And sure enough, Republicans are licking their chops at the prospect of using this vote in the 2022 midterms, especially by linking it to the Democrats’ ambitious spending plans. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, <a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1441066579496685568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> that the committee’s midterm election ads will hit Democrats on a debt limit increase.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And therein lies the rub with the debt ceiling: It’s really a political tool, not a fiscal instrument. “A reason why it's hard to reform is that it's a valuable mechanism for forcing a conversation about deficits and gives Congress leverage to demand concessions,” said Lee. “In the case of unified government, it’s the chance for the party out of power to make some political headway against the party in power, to say they're governing in an irresponsible manner.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, even if many Democrats want to change how the debt ceiling works, Blessing pointed out that such a reform could be too much for members of Congress to take on while Democrats are also trying to pass a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-will-be-disappointed-party-pares-agenda-white-house-2021-10-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still-developing social spending plan</a>. “I don't see them having the bandwidth to do that right now,” said Blessing. “You're asking a lot of people to take votes that are going to make them a little squeamish, particularly for well-known and moderate Democrats, and asking them to deal with debt limit reform on top of that. That is kind of a big ask.” The short-term deal to raise the debt ceiling does give Democrats a little more space to work out the party’s exact social spending legislation, but it’s unclear <a href="https://email.punchbowl.news/t/ViewEmail/t/C16F789594BD16622540EF23F30FEDED/CFF70EDA230965EECE63909E3969C05F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether they’ll have enough time</a> to finish those deliberations before the debt issue once again becomes pressing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet another wrinkle is that the Republican filibuster of a long-term debt ceiling hike has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/debt-ceiling-filibuster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reanimated discussions</a> within the Democratic caucus over changes to the traditional filibuster. Some Democrats, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/politics/biden-debt-ceiling-filibuster/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including President Biden</a>, have raised the idea of altering the rules to allow a simple majority vote to raise the debt ceiling, or even something less specific, such as a <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsaywise/status/1445487774698672132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-day elimination of the filibuster</a>. However, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema <a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have publicly opposed</a> changes to the filibuster rules. And earlier this week, Manchin <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1445122612665933826?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a> on adjusting the filibuster for a debt ceiling hike. Still, Lee wondered if there may have been some calculation by the Democratic leadership in not trying to address the debt limit earlier this year, even though everyone knew well ahead of time that the fight was coming. “This is not a surprise, so why are they letting it come to crisis now at the same time as they have to deal with the infrastructure bill and the reconciliation negotiations on the Build Back Better plan?” asked Lee. “I'm totally speculating, but it is a pressure point for the filibuster.” The filibuster’s future may have played into McConnell’s decision to yield on a short-term increase, as forcing senators such as Manchin and Sinema to choose between defending the filibuster and avoiding default <a href="https://twitter.com/LPDonovan/status/1445887228266307584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have generated</a> enough pressure to truly threaten the filibuster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, changes to the filibuster remain unlikely, and while there are other, <a href="https://www.axios.com/trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-mint-janet-yellen-223e7722-d7ba-47c9-b5f6-49a841d181de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more outrageous ideas</a> for overcoming the debt ceiling, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2014/07/20/333032601/kicking-the-can-down-the-road-a-habit-thats-hard-to-kick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not at all a surprise</a> that Congress has opted to kick the can a few feet down the road with a short-term increase. Come December, Congress will be right back at this same juncture. But as long as the debt ceiling exists in its current form, Congress will keep having these fights over raising it -- even if doing so seems to align with <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einstein-s-parable-of-quantum-insanity/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CInsanity%20is%20doing%20the%20same,usually%20attributed%20to%20Albert%20Einstein." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einstein’s definition of insanity</a>. “As a good governance person, I would like them to procedurally blunt this thing, because I don't think that they have the votes to get rid of it,” said Blessing. “It's just, how do you crowbar that into the congressional calendar with everything else that they're handling, I think is the real question.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): New data released by the FBI last week showed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/fbi-murders-2020-cities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a spike in homicides in 2020</a>, while major crimes overall in the U.S. fell. This marked one of the biggest one-year increases on record, and in addition to the sheer numbers involved, it was also notable that it wasn’t a regional or big-cities-only story — it was a story that affected nearly every part of the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And while it’s very unclear what the spike in murder will mean moving forward — there is some evidence that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/upshot/murder-rise-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 has already been less deadly</a>, for instance — it does raise larger questions around how we think and talk about violent crime in the U.S., especially as it pertains to our politics. For instance, crime and policing were major issues in the 2020 presidential election, with some evidence <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-2020-autopsy-midterms/2021/05/18/6114af82-b80d-11eb-a5fe-bb49dc89a248_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that it may have hurt Democrats</a>. It’s already been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/29/politics/new-york-mayor-primary-eric-adams-rising-crime/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a key issue in the 2021 elections</a>, too; although it isn’t clear whether <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/23/buffalo-mayor-socialist-india-walton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ messaging on policing and crime has hurt them</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s talk about the politics of crime. First of all, what do we even mean when we talk about crime?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/jacob-kaplan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Kaplan</a>, crime researcher at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs): When people talk about crime they’re usually using the FBI’s list of “major crimes” as a guide (whether they realize that or not). The FBI’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/ucr-srs-user-manual-v1.pdf/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list stems back to 1929</a> and includes eight crimes that are serious and generally well-reported — murder, robbery, aggravated assault, rape, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These crimes are then often summed up into a single value of “major crimes,” but the bulk of the crimes in this category is often property crimes, specifically theft.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/latest-crime-data-us-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80334237</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/jennifer-doleac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Doleac</a>, economics professor at Texas A&amp;M University): And crime means different things to different people. The FBI tracks serious crime, as Jacob said — and that’s the stuff most people worry about. But lower-level crime (trespassing, drug possession, shoplifting) is far more common, yet not consistently tracked.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/lisa-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Miller</a>, political science professor at Rutgers University):<strong> </strong>As Jennifer is getting at, it’s important to distinguish between different types of crime. Violent crime, especially homicide, is particularly worrisome, even if it hasn’t directly affected a given community. People are understandably fearful when they start hearing that murders are increasing. So I think that if it’s violence that is on the rise, that really is troubling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/amelia-thomson-deveaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</a>, senior writer): Right, the distinction between property crime and violent crime seems really important. Property crime has been on the decline; it’s violent crime that’s spiking. This is not to say that people aren’t concerned about property crime — but I think when we’re talking about crime in a political context, violence is what drives a lot of the fears and knee-jerk reactions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> And it wasn’t just murder that went up in 2020, either. Aggravated assault — an assault that involved a weapon or seriously injured the victim — went up too, with assaults involving a gun driving a lot of the uptick.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/maggie-koerth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie Koerth</a>, senior science writer): Oh, that’s a really interesting question, Sarah, because it’s bigger than crime statistics. I think it’s about whether people feel safe in their communities. And that can be based on a lot of things. Some real risk to life and limb and some perceptions of risk. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I remember being really struck by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-convinced-crime-is-rising-in-the-u-s-theyre-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the work of Wesley Skogan</a>, who worked in Chicago in the 1990s, documenting the things that people who requested police assistance wanted solved. And what he found was that people were often thinking about things like litter and loud music as emblematic of safety problems or their fear for their communities — even when those things aren’t, strictly speaking, crime. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> The terms can get pretty mushy here, too. If we say that violence is rising, are we talking about murders? Aggravated assault? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Jennifer was suggesting, “crime” and “violence” can mean different things to different people that don’t map easily onto the data we have. And of course, politicians don’t make clean distinctions when they’re talking about crime and violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>I agree with Amelia that violence is what drives fear, though Maggie’s point is really important, too — sometimes a lot of things get conflated. But in <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/crime-and-punishment-in-post-war-britain-mob-rule-as-democratic-corrective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own research</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/incarceration-nation/9ABCAFF7C3E47BCC7F32D800DF3EDF09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in others’</a>, rising violence is something that really registers for people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> “Crime” is such a vague term and can range from shoplifting to murder that even academics have a hard time agreeing on what offenses should be included.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> That’s completely right, Jacob. And it tends to be defined through policing data, too — which is kind of odd in itself, since arrests are just the beginning of a<em> long</em> criminal justice process that doesn’t necessarily end in a conviction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> Yeah, I think if we had much better court/prosecutor data, we’d have completely different conversations about crime. But there’s almost no good public data on that (though Philadelphia’s district attorney’s office <a href="https://billypenn.com/2019/10/03/philly-da-krasner-criminal-justice-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is one exception</a>), so as Amelia says, we’re reliant on data that is first reported to or observed by the police and then reported by the police to the FBI.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One thing we do see in the data, though, is that<strong> </strong>the 2020 murder spike is also relatively broad — affecting a lot more people than just “gang members,” as <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/retaliatory-gang-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some organizations</a> have claimed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to my analysis of FBI data for agencies that reported detailed murder info in both 2019 and 2020, nearly every single group of murder victims experienced an uptick last year — though it’s important to stress that some of these groups have really low incident rates to begin with, which can result in large swings between years.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> Woah, Jacob. Does that mean that violence against husbands is way up and violence against wives is down?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> Yes, but remember: Few husbands are murdered. For instance, 58 husbands were killed in 2019, compared with 79 in 2020. Whereas, for wives, 330 were murdered in 2019, compared with 294 in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> Gotcha. That makes a lot more sense. So the big takeaway from that chart is less about the different types of victims affected, and more that murder increases in 2020 aren’t something that was happening to a narrow swath of the population?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> Right. Nearly every relationship group had an increased number of murders in 2020, regardless of the relationship type, so one takeaway from the uptick in murders in 2020 is that it’s not isolated to certain types of murders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Jacob, do we have a sense yet for why the murder spike is so broad?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> I don’t think we’ll be able to answer why it’s so broad for a while — especially not until the other, more detailed FBI data comes out from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/nibrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Incident-Based Reporting System later this year.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there is evidence at this point that it’s not just an increase in gun violence in 2020; other use of deadly weapons also increased.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, however, the quality of the data does seem to have dropped in 2020. There was just a lot more incomplete data. True, the data quality is generally pretty unsatisfactory, given that reporting is voluntary so not all agencies report in the first place, but I’d guess that there was an effect had by the transition to how the FBI is now collecting this data and the resource constraints caused by COVID-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Well, that answers one question I had, Jacob. I had seen <a href="https://www.vox.com/22529989/2020-murders-guns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a theory floated</a> that people were simply carrying more guns in 2020, and that this explains some of the increase. But if use of other weapons increased too, that’s plainly not the answer!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> There is good evidence that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-police-increase-gun-seizures-but-shootings-rise-11618494435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people were carrying more guns</a>, and gun murders did go up more than other types of murders. But it’s not the only story.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> That’s interesting. One thought I had prior to you saying that: Research that has suggested <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more guns in a household or a community is correlated with an increased risk of homicide</a> for the people who live there. Like, it wasn’t shocking to me to see a massive increase in gun purchasing and a big increase in gun murders happening in tandem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But clearly that’s not the whole story here.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/policing-happen-77102704</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>Is it possible that the broadness of the spike in murder is a function of decline in trust and legitimacy as a result of the pandemic? Or polarization and general political unrest, more generally? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Lisa, do you mean that people were less likely to call the police or other authorities when they were in situations that could lead to violence, and that perhaps this explains the spike?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>Amelia, I was thinking more about theories of violence self-help — that is, people are less likely to restrain the urge to act out violently when there is less of a sense of shared legitimacy and social trust. Or the idea that <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Losing-Legitimacy-Street-Crime-And-The-Decline-Of-Social-Institutions-In/Lafree/p/book/9780813334516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminologist Gary LaFree</a> and <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674035201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historian Randolph Roth</a> have put forth that suggests societies with higher levels of social trust and political legitimacy experience lower rates of homicide. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, when those relations break down — or if they are not deeply established in the first place — we see higher levels of homicide. And we certainly seem to be living in such a time period now, where trust and legitimacy were already pretty low even before the pandemic. I wonder if the pandemic may have exacerbated those problems.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> You guys, why can’t crime patterns neatly stick to theories of crime and human behavior? (I kid.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> As you all are getting at, there is no one answer for why there was an increase in violent crime, but what are some of the factors we can point to? We’ve talked about the role guns played in this and how that’s not the whole story. But what role did the pandemic play? Or last summer’s protests for racial justice that followed George Floyd’s murder? Is there a “<a href="https://theconversation.com/more-guns-pandemic-stress-and-a-police-legitimacy-crisis-created-perfect-conditions-for-homicide-spike-in-2020-168823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police legitimacy crisis</a>” as political scientist Justin Nix has argued?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac: </strong>I’ve had the chance to preview a few as-of-yet unpublished studies with conflicting answers about what happens to the reporting of crime to police after high-profile police killings. It seems to matter sometimes but not always — perhaps because communities that were most affected didn’t trust the police much in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> of a “Ferguson effect,” where police appear to pull back in the face of criticism/protests. And, of course, it’s hard to isolate the effect of the pandemic as everyone is stressed out and many people lost jobs and income over the past year and a half, so those issues could be contributing to the increase in violence, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are just a bunch of possible explanations and no good way to nail down whether one is better than others. We may never know, given how much was going on during this period.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> And when you consider that we still don’t have a consensus for why violent crime increased in the 1980s and then decreased in the 1990s — and even continued its decrease up until now — it’s going to be really hard to figure out what’s happening now, like Jennifer said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Yeah, the difficulty of untangling different, simultaneous social forces is something that a bunch of experts raised when I was talking to them about <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-doesnt-know-why-crime-rises-or-falls-neither-does-biden-or-any-other-politician/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why crime rose and fell</a> a few decades ago. You can’t go back and do a lot of controlled experiments to figure it out, unfortunately!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jacob.kaplan:</strong> And even if you could, what worked in the 1990s may not work now.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> But the political dimensions are really interesting to me. Criminal justice reform takes a loooooong time. So even when politicians do focus on it, the incentive is to do something that has a quick impact they can point to. Which is not always what’s best or most effective.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac: </strong>It’s a challenging conversation to have now, given some of the politics around police reform, but I think police reform is still very important to improving trust between communities and law enforcement. We have lots of evidence that police are very effective at reducing violent crime, like homicide. <a href="http://morganwilliamsjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chalfin_et_al_2021_WP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One paper</a> from a group of economists and public policy scholars finds that hiring more police officers reduces homicide rates and disproportionately benefits Black communities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the nonprofit Criminal Justice Expert Panel (which I co-direct) recently <a href="https://cjexpertpanel.org/surveys/reducing-gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveyed leading crime researchers about popular options</a> for reducing gun violence, such as gang-takedowns/hot-spot policing, community-led violence interrupters and focused deterrence on community members known to be at-risk. We found that researchers were most bullish on the first option (gang-takedowns/hot-spot policing) and somewhat optimistic about the third (focused deterrence), though with lots of caveats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The evidence on focused deterrence (which involves police) and community-led violence interrupters (which do not), however, is pretty weak and mixed. That means, despite both being popular among advocates of police reform, we’re not actually sure those policies are proven. It doesn’t mean they’re not promising, but it’s complicated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>What I find interesting here is that many of the policies and programs — which are evidence-based — are the types of programs that have historically come under fire from <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/defunding-the-police-will-actually-make-us-safer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groups critical of the police</a>. “Gang takedowns,” hot-spot policing and focused deterrence sound a lot like the kind of aggressive policing — including stop and frisk — that is likely to run into resistance from groups that are seeking to minimize, not expand, the role of policing in confronting crime. While the public would like to see the police involved <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/6/16/voters-support-the-use-of-nonpolice-first-responders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in fewer social problems</a>, there is <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/usa-today-crime-and-safety-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread support</a> for the police dealing with serious crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> One of the things I thought was interesting <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-police-reform-a-fundamentally-flawed-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when Amelia and I were reporting on police reforms</a> is that all those things COULD represent aggressive policing — or they might not. It depends on how they’re implemented, and they’re implemented in such different ways that it’s often hard to compare data. And it ends up making these conversations harder, too. Because some people might imagine “hot-spot policing” and think of stop and frisk. And some people might imagine something more like a beat cop with a presence in the community. And it could mean either or both.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> And one of the challenges for me in thinking about what’s “evidence-based” is that the experiences of the people who are living in high-crime communities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/17/we-listened-people-highly-policed-us-communities/?utm_campaign=wp_monkeycage&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be hard to incorporate</a> in that kind of research. Maybe a particular reform or approach does reduce crime in the short term — but does it make people living in those places feel safer in the long run? That’s obviously harder to measure, but it’s important to explore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> We’ve talked about some of the reasons why violent crime might have spiked in 2020, as well as possible ways to curb it going forward, but what are some of the risks if elected officials ignore the problem? Is this <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an issue that is particularly challenging for Democrats</a> because of where some on the political left stand on police reform?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> Well, to state the obvious, it’s bad if politicians are ignoring a trend that is making people’s lives worse or more dangerous. So if people are truly feeling less safe, that’s important for politicians to address. The problem is that it’s hard to figure out how much of people’s feelings <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/16/voters-perceptions-of-crime-continue-to-conflict-with-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are being driven</a> by what politicians are saying about crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>I think of this in two ways — the short-term and the long-term. In the long-term, if this is a temporary rise in violence, it’s possible it won’t have a big electoral impact. In the short term, I do think it carries risks for some Democrats if they are primarily responsive to the groups demanding that cities <a href="https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/6-reasons-why-its-time-to-defund-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divest from policing or shrink police forces</a>. People want <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195331684.001.0001/acprof-9780195331684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more police when violence is rising</a>. That doesn’t mean they want police to be abusive or violent. But reducing police services during such a time has some political peril.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>jennifer.doleac: </strong>Another possible risk here is that the momentum behind criminal justice reform is lost. There has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-prison-reform-has-bipartisan-support-but-its-moving-slowly/2020/01/08/81edfbd6-3268-11ea-898f-eb846b7e9feb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad support for meaningful reforms</a> across the criminal justice system, for many years now. That’s likely in part because people have felt safe enough to be open to scaling back things like policing and incarceration. But if violent crime starts rising, that support might vanish, even if those reforms were moving us in the right direction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>ameliatd:</strong> It’s not a good thing that murders are up! But it’s hard to have these discussions in a nuanced way. Nor is it often in politicians’ best interest to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Electorally, though, is it worse for Democrats? I’m not sure. I think the bigger risk is that, as Jennifer and others are saying, reform policies that were getting floated on the left get scaled back because of fears about the electoral consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>maggie.koerth:</strong> And whether it’s electorally bad or not, it’s bad for the reforms — because the perception of electoral challenges is there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Do you all see politics forcing a choice between reform and safety? Or rather, safety from police and safety from criminals? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>lisa.miller: </strong>I think some politicians will present the choice that way, but I don’t think that is inevitable.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What I can say — from 25 years of researching the politics of violent crime in local, state, national and cross-national contexts — is that a serious crime wave is likely to result in more policing and more imprisonment. That has <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190228705.001.0001/acprof-9780190228705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happened in every context I’ve examined</a>. But policing and prisons don’t have to be the only responses, and the responses don’t have to be on a mass scale. There are many ways to increase policing, and even confinement, that are not as brutal as the system we have in the U.S.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">President Joe Biden spent the beginning of his term comfortably above water in the polls. On July 20, the six-month anniversary of his inauguration, his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average job approval rating</a> stood at 52.3 percent, and his average disapproval rating stood at 42.5 percent — numbers that were fairly representative of his first semester. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-approval-rating-has-barely-budged-in-his-first-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">honeymoon period</a> came to a halt in late summer. The delta variant of the coronavirus led to a surge in cases and deaths starting in late July, accompanied by renewed fears about the economy and inflation; by Aug. 15, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s approval rating had dropped</a> 2.3 percentage points (to 50.0 percent), and his disapproval rating had risen 1.3 points (to 43.8 percent). That same day, the Taliban <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/taliban-seize-jalalabad-cut-off-afghan-capital-east-79462637" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized control of Kabul</a>, the capital of Afghanistan, completing a stunningly fast collapse of the country’s government following the withdrawal of American troops. The Taliban takeover, and the ensuing <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/afghanistan-faces-humanitarian-crisis-taliban-takes-control-79521011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humanitarian crisis</a>, appeared to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerate the decrease in Biden’s popularity</a>. By Aug. 30, more Americans disapproved of Biden’s job performance than approved of it, and on Sept. 8, his approval/disapproval spread was 45.0 percent to 49.1 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the time, we theorized that Biden’s approval rating might recover before too long, especially once the news cycle moved on from the crisis in Afghanistan. After all, presidents’ approval ratings <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to revert to the mean</a>, and fluctuations in former President Donald Trump’s approval rating were especially short-lived. But we’re now more than a month removed from Biden’s difficult August, and there have been no signs of a rebound in his approval rating. At the end of the day on Oct. 5, Biden’s approval/disapproval spread was 44.8 percent to 47.9 percent. That approval rating, in fact, is so far the lowest of his presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s approval rating has failed to improve even as Afghanistan has faded from the headlines. According to <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv&amp;t=summary&amp;k=Afghanistan&amp;ts=custom&amp;sdt=20210801000000&amp;edt=20210930235959&amp;fs=station%3ACNN&amp;fs=station%3AFOXNEWS&amp;fs=station%3AMSNBC&amp;fcs=comb&amp;fdn=raw&amp;fdr=day&amp;fdt=-05%3A00&amp;svt=zoom&amp;svts=zoom&amp;swvt=zoom&amp;ssc=yes&amp;sshc=yes&amp;swc=yes&amp;stcl=yes&amp;c=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed-captioning data</a> from the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Television News Archive</a>, from Aug. 12 through Sept. 1, the three major cable-news networks (CNN, Fox News and MSNBC) mentioned Afghanistan in an average of 1,320 15-second clips per day. From Sept. 2 through Sept. 30, however, they mentioned the country in an average of only 403 clips per day. (This is, however, still more often than Afghanistan was in the news before the Taliban’s takeover. From Aug. 1 through Aug. 11, the three networks mentioned Afghanistan in an average of just 56 clips per day.)</p>

The timing of it suggested it was also driven by the resurgent pandemic, dissatisfaction with the economy, or even natural post-honeymoon reversion to a mean that is more realistic in these polarized times. In other words, a myriad of factors.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Accordingly, there may be no easy fix for Biden. Even an improvement in the COVID-19 situation may not improve his political fortunes: According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data compiled by The New York Times</a>, the rolling average of newly detected COVID-19 cases nationally has decreased since mid-September, but <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s average approval rating on the issue of the coronavirus</a> has remained steady. (As of Oct. 5,<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5 p.m. Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> 50.5 percent of Americans approved of his handling of the pandemic, and 40.7 percent disapproved.) </p>

It doesn’t mean, however, that Biden won’t receive a political boost if and when the pandemic truly ends. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other news developments could help or hurt Biden politically as well, such as whether Democrats in Congress pass their infrastructure and budget reconciliation bills or if the government defaults on its debt. So we’ll have to wait and see what happens to Biden’s approval rating going forward — which will be important for, among other reasons, assessing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how big of a shellacking Democrats will receive in the 2022 midterm elections</a> (or if they will receive one at all). But for now at least, Biden has a lower approval rating at this point in his term than all but two presidents<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerald Ford and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> since 1945, so if he’s going to regain his popularity, he’s got an unusually big hole to dig himself out of.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Narrow majorities and an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-an-ambitious-agenda-heres-what-they-should-learn-from-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious policy agenda</a> have proven to be a tough combination for Democrats. In the past few weeks, congressional Democrats have been involved in a number of talks among party factions and with the Biden administration over the fate of two major bills: their <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan infrastructure bill</a> and their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-congress-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion spending plan</a>. At this point, too, both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/us/politics/pelosi-infrastructure-house-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive</a> and more <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/politics/house-moderate-democrats-infrastructure-strategy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate Democrats</a> have threatened to walk away from the deals — one reason why so <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/25/biden-agenda-democrats-congress-514263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many headlines are declaring</a> that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/01/30/people-used-to-joke-about-democrats-in-disarray-theyre-not-joking-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are in disarray</a>. Moreover, regardless of the outcome of these specific bills, it is likely that struggles between moderate and progressive members of the party will continue to be an issue going forward.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But does this mean that the internal fault lines in the Democratic Party are likely to be detrimental to its functioning? Or are we just seeing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-23/are-democrats-in-disarray-or-just-negotiating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy negotiating</a> in a party that represents a diverse array of constituencies and interests?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On one hand, the resonance of the “Democrats in disarray” trope is due to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-too-much-media-attention-could-hurt-the-democrats-new-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the media’s interest in covering conflict</a>, and as was true historically, the Democratic Party remains a patchwork party. Coalitions have certainly changed — gone are the days of the <a href="https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt/the-american-franchise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uneasy “New Deal Coalition”</a> between civil rights supporters and the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Dixiecrat_Revolt_and_the_End_of_the/EWu2AX7Gx4YC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=the+dixiecrat+revolt&amp;pg=PP5&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement’s opponents</a> — but Democrats must now balance<strong> </strong>a multiracial coalition that is multifaceted in what it wants politically. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, the past several election cycles have featured debates between progressive and moderate Democrats over how far to the left the party should go in its stance on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/09/2020-election-news-democrats-embrace-15-minimum-wage-against-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the minimum wage</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21005124/2020-presidential-candidates-health-care-democratic-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a universal health care system</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/14/20880659/2020-democratic-debates-climate-change-six-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressing climate change</a>.<strong> </strong>Splits in the Democratic Party are further complicated by the fact that support from voters without a college degree, who tend to be less likely to <a href="https://www.marottaonmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Understanding-Shifts-in-Democratic-Party-Ideology-Article.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identify as liberal</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is declining</a>, while college-educated voters, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who tend to be more liberal</a>, are growing in influence. These ideological divides are also evident by age: Younger voters, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/election-young-voters-biden-democratic-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are generally more progressive</a> — especially on issues like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/10/30/young-voters-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> — are another important constituency shaping disagreements on economic and cultural issues in the party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, no matter how uneasy the coalition of progressives and moderates might be at times, Democrats are overall much closer ideologically than they were previously.<strong> </strong>Additionally, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative partisanship</a> means that no faction in the Democratic Party is likely to defect to the Republican Party or do anything that would help Republicans electorally (like splinter off and form a new political group). Finally, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalized nature</a> of our party politics means that all members’ fortunes are increasingly tied to the party brand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, even though there is less ideological diversity in the Democratic Party today — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/328367/americans-political-ideology-held-steady-2020.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very few Democrats identify as conservative</a>, for instance — the question of just how liberal Democrats are willing to go is still a big one that can cause a lot of problems for the party. As underscored by the recent negotiations over infrastructure and the budget, it’s possible, too, that some of these ideological fights are pretty muddy. In the House, there’s the progressive faction, represented by <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJayapal/status/1445025926627004416?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Pramila Jayapal</a>; the moderate faction, represented by <a href="https://www.insidernj.com/the-gottheimer-ascendancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Josh Gottheimer</a> and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-drove-9-moderate-house-democrats-to-hold-up-their-partys-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight other House moderates</a> who have worked to limit the spending in the bills; and the faction of “mainstream” liberals, who are ready and willing to cut deals, represented by leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three ideological factions is certainly challenging to manage, but it also makes sense for a party that represents such a wide range of constituencies. Often, compromises can be found to honor different preferences and priorities. On Friday, for instance, President Biden and Pelosi said that <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-floats-roughly-2-trillion-price-tag-for-reconciliation-08740ed0-2db3-4ce7-8088-2a1d36644e38.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting on the bipartisan infrastructure bill must again be delayed</a> until Democrats are able to make progress on their party’s spending plan. This move was a victory for progressives in that they had threatened to tank the bipartisan bill without being able to also vote on the Democrats’ ambitious budget. Cutting the spending plan’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/politics/progressives-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-democrats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 trillion price tag</a> — something moderates in the party have long pushed for — also points to the limits of what progressives will be able to demand in future negotiations. Remember, though, this big-tent party approach to politics isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s part of governing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is a more concerning possibility that Democrats are divided not only on questions of policy but also on an establishment versus anti-establishment dimension. Hints of this appear in the efforts of Democratic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/03/joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-democrats-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin</a> to cultivate political reputations independent from — even in defiance of — their party. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/22/bernie-sanders-just-declared-war-on-the-democratic-establishment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-establishment</a> rhetoric has sometimes been a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-pelosi-versus-squad-paradigm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staple of the left</a>, too. Sen. Bernie Sanders liked to use these appeals during his two presidential bids, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/18/progressives-democratic-party-despair-255675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presenting himself to supporters</a> as a rebuke to the party establishment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former FiveThirtyEighter <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-two-cracks-in-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Enten and I wrote</a> about this phenomenon in the Republican Party in 2017, and four years later, it doesn’t seem like it was a positive development for the GOP. That’s because unlike policy, “outsider status” isn’t something that can be easily solved by compromise. As a result, the Republican Party has become less open to <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/for-2020-2003/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissenting views</a> and a big-tent approach to policy and instead more dominated by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-might-still-be-trumps-party-but-that-doesnt-mean-theres-room-for-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a loyalty to former President Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible a similar fate <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/virginia-democrats-challengers-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could befall Democrats</a>. After all, Democrats’ two major bills could still fall apart, suggesting that the party’s differences are a serious hindrance to accomplishing Biden’s agenda. It’s also possible that some Democratic factions <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/primary-distrust-political-distrust-and-support-for-the-insurgent-candidacies-of-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-in-the-2016-primary/578E3061392DDE1BF3BE3F615054F97A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distrust the party’s leadership</a> enough to create a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/democrats-divided-progressives-centrists-say-trust-gone-a3d66f83ddac9b18e607f46429dbc408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent fault line</a> around “outsider” status, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/us/politics/tea-party-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Tea Party movement did for the Republicans</a>. However, the lack of a polarizing internal figure like Trump works in Democrats’ favor, and most congressional Democrats seem to at least want <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1041793588/a-looming-partial-government-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative victories</a>, not just take public stances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what will determine whether intra-party disagreement proves to be a healthy back-and-forth among Democrats or a dysfunctional rivalry? There are a few things to look for. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, the depth of the policy disagreements. So far, it hasn’t seemed like there was much disagreement over the Democrats’ need to pursue both bills — just over the strategy and dollar amount. That said, within the party, you can still see the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/31/are-we-entering-a-new-political-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stirrings of disagreement</a> around whether the country needs some of its basic structures overhauled — including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/18/democrats-campaign-is-fight-over-future-american-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy and income inequality</a>, voting rights protections, and questions like <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/statehood-for-washington-d-c-and-puerto-rico-background-and-political-implications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitting new states</a> or <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/15/democrats-introduce-legislation-expand-supreme-court/7233345002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restructuring the courts</a>. These issues could become widely held Democratic priorities, or they could expose serious variation in the way different legislators and their voters view American politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other danger is that the divisions among Democrats start to look like those in the party system at large — that is, more splits rooted in <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo27527354.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social identities</a> that are increasingly focused on winning rather than on identifying common goals. Put another way, if any faction of the Democratic party becomes more interested in <a href="https://www.legbranch.org/honest-messengers-how-symbolic-messaging-votes-in-congress-match-vote-choices-on-real-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging than legislating</a>, it’ll lose incentives to compromise. In fact, the incentives will ultimately go the other way, making it more attractive to take a stand than to pass a bill. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the Democratic Party doesn’t seem close to this situation right now. While it may not always seem like it, the different factions in the Democratic Party still represent policy differences — not fault lines. That’s namely because ideological differences still don’t map perfectly onto the party’s different constituencies. Yes, some of the party’s moderates, like Manchin, represent constituencies further from the mainstream of the Democratic Party — <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/which-us-states-are-the-oldest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">places with</a> more <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/WV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white, older voters</a>. But this isn’t true of all moderate Democrats. Rep. Carolyn Bordeaux of Georgia, for instance, represents a majority-minority district that has <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US1307-congressional-district-7-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial populations</a> of Black, Latino and Asian residents. And while someone like Jayapal, who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, represents a far more diverse district with a lot of <a href="https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=53&amp;cd=07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college-educated voters</a>, Rep. Ilhan Omar, who isn’t that different from Jayapal politically, hails from a district with a <a href="https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=27&amp;cd=05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much lower share</a> of college-educated voters. As a result, ideological differences are not likely to create permanently warring factions in the Democratic Party — at least at this point. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Party divisions are inevitable in big-tent coalitions. Policy disagreements across the ideological spectrum are healthy: It’s arguably the efforts to flatten out these divisions among Republicans that have made the past few years so troubling for the Republican Party and its role in American democracy. The nature of partisan politics has also made it harder for internal factions to splinter from the Democratic Party. Trying to form a third party would tank electoral prospects and all but ensure Republican victories at the federal level. And Republicans are unlikely to go after progressives, regardless of how disgruntled that group might become with the Democratic leadership. This should allow progressives and moderates to form flexible coalitions in the long term, and hold off the biggest threat to party stability — one faction getting angry enough to leave altogether. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The government avoided a shutdown last week, but questions remain over how much of President Biden’s agenda Congress will pass. Democrats delayed a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill after progressives said they would not vote for it without an agreement on a separate social programs bill. That latter bill is still in flux, though: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin suggested a price tag <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/30/manchin-proposed-15t-topline-number-to-schumer-this-summer-514803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion less</a> than what other Democrats originally proposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew tries to unpack what’s driving Democrats’ decisions and who will have to compromise to get both bills passed. They also address a listener question that suggests Republicans achieve their policy goals more often than Democrats. They discuss whether that assumption is really true, why partisans often <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/25/winners-and-losers-in-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feel the opposing party wins more</a> and how to measure victory in politics. Finally, they preview next month’s gubernatorial election in Virginia and what it can tell us about the 2022 midterms.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court is more conservative than it’s been in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/politics/supreme-court-conservative/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost a century</a>. ​​Its new term begins today, and by next June, when the term ends, Americans might finally understand what that means. Public opinion of the court is already <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a record low</a> after the court allowed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a strict abortion law to go into effect in Texas</a> in early September. Now, the justices are preparing to hear the court’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990846329/supreme-court-to-take-up-first-major-gun-rights-case-in-more-than-a-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first major gun rights case since 2010</a> as well as a case on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the future of abortion in the U.S.</a> Both cases could result in decisions that are far more extreme than most Americans want. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the past, a desire to preserve the court’s apolitical reputation <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-can-stop-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the justices</a> from straying too far from public opinion. That could happen again — in fact, Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-big-rulings-were-surprisingly-mainstream-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has so far proven remarkably adept</a> at producing decisions that protect the court’s reputation and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ab215fc5f71b8d24e0360f69f011cf67" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are often portrayed</a> as more moderate and mainstream than they really are. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This term, though, the other conservative justices might be fine with taking a very public right turn. Neither <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-views-on-gun-control-have-changed-in-the-last-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding gun rights</a> nor <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-dont-want-roe-v-wade-repealed-but-many-also-support-restrictions-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturning Roe v. Wade</a> would be popular, yet the court is considering both — a sign of how conservative it has already become. The question now is whether the risk of a backlash is enough to keep the conservative majority from, say, overturning Roe in an election year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The justices are plainly conscious of public attitudes toward the court,” said <a href="https://polisci.osu.edu/people/baum.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence Baum</a>, a political science professor at Ohio State University. “But that’s only one consideration for the justices and not necessarily the most important one — particularly on issues like abortion or gun rights where they may have intense personal preferences about the right outcome.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/texas-abortion-ban-rest-country-fivethirtyeight-79824406</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The justices are already entering the term with mixed reviews from the general public. <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/22/poll-support-u-s-supreme-court-drops/5804331001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Marquette University Law School poll conducted in September</a> found that only 49 percent of Americans approved of the court, down from 60 percent just a year earlier. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354908/approval-supreme-court-down-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll conducted in September</a> found a similar drop: Only 40 percent of U.S. adults approved of the court, down from 53 percent a year earlier. According to Gallup, a majority (53 percent) of U.S. adults now disapprove of the way the court is handling its job.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Approval of the Supreme Court is at a record low" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Erg3e/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In theory, the justices should have no reason to watch their polling numbers. Our system is actually designed that way: Federal judges have life tenure in part <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed78.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to insulate them from the vagaries of politics</a>. But research suggests that the justices are influenced by what Americans think, at least to a certain extent. For example, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2087255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several studies</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00485.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have found</a> that the Supreme Court’s ideological tilt tracks with public opinion over time, which is unlikely to be coincidental. And <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/clark-tom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clark</a>, a political scientist at Emory University, found in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00411.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate review</a> of congressional bills that when Congress introduced more bills designed to curb the court, the justices struck down fewer laws. According to Clark, that suggests that the court saw the bills as a signal from Congress that they were going too far, even though the bills were unlikely to pass.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this year, President Biden arguably introduced his own version of a court-curbing bill, in the form of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/us/politics/biden-supreme-court-packing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a commission to study</a> expanding the Supreme Court. But the conservatives don’t have a lot to fear there, at least for now, because the commission seems <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/10/22375792/supreme-court-biden-commission-reform-court-packing-federalist-society" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely to recommend</a> big changes. And even if it did, GOP senators won’t support court reform, which means Democrats <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56893296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would have to abolish the filibuster</a> to make that happen — currently <a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a no-go in the Senate</a>. All in all, the conservative justices don't have a lot of reason to see Biden's move as a threat.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It's also possible that Supreme Court justices mostly care about their reputation among a select group of Americans. Baum and <a href="https://law2.wm.edu/faculty/bios/fulltime/nedevi.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neal Devins</a>, a professor of law and government at the College of William &amp; Mary, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-company-they-keep-9780190278052?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued</a> that Supreme Court justices are more interested in how they’re regarded by elites. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is significant for understanding why the conservative justices’ behavior has become more predictably right-wing. Baum and Devins argue that as elites have grown more politically polarized, the justices’ partisan tendencies have hardened as well. In other words, the people influencing the conservative justices' thoughts are probably much more right-wing than the public at large. On top of that, some of the justices may be willing to risk backlash for the outcome they believe is correct. “Is legitimacy something that’s enough to get a justice to move away from something [he or she] strongly feels?” Baum told me. With the possible exception of Roberts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/john-roberts-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is particularly focused on the court’s image</a>, Baum doesn’t think the public’s views will be enough to sway a justice who cares deeply about the issue they’re deciding.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this might be right. On one hand, it’s not obvious that a single unpopular ruling -- even if it’s high-profile -- would be enough to sow widespread doubt in the Supreme Court’s legitimacy. Take the outcome in Bush v. Gore, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/us/bush-prevails-single-vote-justices-end-recount-blocking-gore-after-5-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where a divided Supreme Court</a>, split along partisan lines, effectively handed the presidency to George W. Bush. The ruling was intensely controversial at the time, but it <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to have had</a> little lasting impact on the court’s image. And although it might be hard to imagine, the same could be true of a decision that overturns or reshapes Roe — particularly if the justices  merely limit the constitutional right to abortion, rather than eliminate it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the question of how a highly conservative Supreme Court majority will navigate public opinion isn’t going away. And it becomes even more relevant if the conservatives maintain control of the court for years or even decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In the past, even if the court was trending conservative overall, it wasn’t like the conservatives always won and the liberals always lost,” said <a href="https://pppa.wsu.edu/michael-salamone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Salamone</a>, a political science professor at Washington State University who studies the Supreme Court and public opinion. “Now it’s looking like conservative victories are going to be a lot more consistent and a lot more far-reaching.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, this new term might be a turning point — and not just because of the importance of the cases or the risk of a backlash to an individual decision. The next few months might be the beginning of a new era in which the conservative justices move sharply away from where most Americans stand on major issues, and dare politicians to do something about it.</p>

			<title>Where Breitbart’s False Claim That Democrats Want Republicans To Stay Unvaccinated Came From</title>

			<category>Say What?</category>
			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the latest edition of our column that excavates the origins of public figures’ factually dubious comments. We explain what their claims are referring to, the evidence (or lack thereof) behind them and where they sprang from in the first place.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Who said what …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few weeks ago, Breitbart News — the right-wing, hyperpartisan news site <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/steve-bannon-breitbart-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formerly run by Steve Bannon</a> — published a truly <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galaxy brain</a> column. Editor-at-large <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2021/09/10/nolte-howard-stern-proves-democrats-want-unvaccinated-trump-voters-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Nolte argued</a> that Democrats have been promoting the COVID-19 vaccine not to save lives but instead to trick Republican voters into <em>not</em> getting the jab. Nolte’s theory concluded that this, in turn, would lead to unvaccinated Republicans getting sick and dying from COVID-19, ultimately helping Democrats electorally. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte claimed that liberals, in a sinister application of reverse psychology, knew that aggressively pushing the vaccine would lead those on the right to <em>resist</em>, putting them at greater risk for severe infection or death. “In a country where elections are decided on razor-thin margins, does it not benefit one side if their opponents simply drop dead?” Nolte wrote. He then said that the real way to stick it to liberals would be to embrace the “Trump Vaccine” for the life-saving modern miracle that it is.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sometimes flawed logic can still lead you to the correct conclusion.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/white-evangelicals-rethinking-politics-fivethirtyeight-80316696</p>


<h2><strong>Some background …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte’s take has emerged from the toxic politicization of the pandemic in the U.S. Since the COVID-19 vaccine rollout began in the U.S, there has been a partisan gap in vaccination rates. When comparing the rate of fully vaccinated people living in counties that voted for Trump in 2020 with those in counties that voted for Biden, blue counties had a higher vaccination rate by 12.9 percentage points, according <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>. Similarly, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/covid19-vaccine-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> has shown that Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say they are unsure of whether they will get the vaccine. Republicans are also more likely to say they do not plan on getting vaccinated, according to that same poll. And it’s true that more right-leaning areas of the country are seeing more deaths from COVID-19, too: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent New York Times analysis</a> showed states with some of the highest 2020 vote share for Trump also have the highest death rates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These differences in vaccination rates and COVID-19 death rates can be attributed to a few factors, including misinformation online and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the erosion of trust</a> in institutions such as the medical system and the media over the past few years. It can also be partly attributed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-0433cfa3b684b50d0c67ed254f8d8c39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rhetoric from Republican leaders</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/conservative-talk-radio-covid-deaths/2021/08/31/a912a89c-0a66-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figures on the right</a>, especially when you consider that similar partisan gaps <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/7/6/22554198/political-polarization-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have not been seen in other countries</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is no evidence that those who have encouraged Americans to get vaccinated secretly hoped they would do the opposite. </p>

<h2><strong>Where the comment came from …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the Brietbart column’s argument may seem unhinged, Nolte is in fact tapping into a number of right-wing tropes. Conspiratorial thinking has become a habit on the right — think the Big Lie or QAnon — so proposing a conspiracy to explain Republicans’ low vaccination rates may not be anathema for many of Nolte’s readers. Similarly, allegations of Democrats or leftists running false flag operations — where the responsible party for an event makes it look like another party is in fact behind the act — are common among the far-right. Many have claimed, for example, that the rioters who broke into the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 were actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/us/politics/antifa-conspiracy-capitol-riot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of antifa disguised</a> to look like Trump supporters in order to make the right look bad. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The notion that politicians may be using reverse psychology when referencing the vaccine is also familiar to many on the right, albeit inverted from Nolte’s presentation of it. Those who oppose the vaccine — particularly those who incorrectly believe it to be harmful — have been surprised to hear former President Donald Trump promote it, and reverse psychology has been a useful explanation for his seeming deviation from their worldview. These theories claim that Trump’s encouragement of vaccinations would make the vaccine <em>less</em> appealing to anti-Trump voters, while arguing that those who support Trump are wise enough to “do their own research” and avoid it despite his recommendation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As far as him promoting it, my thought is [he is using] reverse psychology for the sheep with [<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/politics/trump-derangement-syndrome/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump Derangement Syndrome</a>] [who] will automatically just do the opposite of what he says,” one Telegram user wrote in a QAnon chat group. “What if Trump is promoting the vaccine to get the ‘Never’ Trumpers to rethink their decision,” wrote another in the same chat. “Anything he promotes they will do the reverse. He must know that those of us that are aware of the real and apparent dangers will NOT get it, even with his endorsement.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nolte also specifically tapped into another American tension: As the partisan gap persists, some on the left have shifted from encouraging those on the right to get vaccinated, to getting frustrated and angry that they still haven’t. This has manifested in sometimes flippant, sometimes cruel reactions to the high rates of infection and death among unvaccinated Americans. Nolte highlighted Howard Stern, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/09/09/howard-stern-unvaccinated-freedom-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who recently suggested</a> on his radio show that unvaccinated individuals who become sick should be denied medical care. Stern also said it was “funny” that some conservative radio hosts who spoke out against the vaccine <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/conservative-talk-radio-covid-deaths/2021/08/31/a912a89c-0a66-11ec-aea1-42a8138f132a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later died of COVID-19</a>. There’s also <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/09/hermancainaward-subreddit-antivaxxer-deaths-cataloged.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the r/HermanCainAward subreddit</a>, named after the Republican politician who died of COVID-19 in 2020, a group with 343,000 members that exists exclusively to mock people who expressed anti-vaccine views and later died of COVID-19.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, if Nolte’s column convinces some vaccine-resisters to get the shot, one <em>might</em> argue that the end justifies the means. But so far the response to the column on the right hasn’t been positive. On Breitbart’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/95475020353/posts/10168131523170354" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook post</a> sharing the column, many commenters rejected the argument, noting that their personal motivations for not getting vaccinated had nothing to do with what Democrats said, and pointing out that some unvaccinated Americans are on the left. “This is a stupid take. You have clearly bought into the democrat talking point that it’s only republicans not getting vaccinated when the reality is that people across the board are not getting vaccinated,” one Facebook user commented. Similar sentiments were shared on Telegram and the pro-Trump message board patriots.win. “Me not getting the Vax has absolutely nothing to do with what the left is saying!” one user wrote in a QAnon Telegram group. Another user in the same group noted: “But didn’t Trump get his vax? It isn’t about Trump, it’s about our personal health.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using conspiratorial thinking to bring conspiracy theorists back to reality may not be the most effective tactic after all. As one Telegram user put it: “Sounds like they’re trying to use reverse psychology by saying they are already using reverse psychology.” </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats in Congress have their work cut out for them this fall. They were able to cut a deal with Republican lawmakers to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/politics/government-funding-shutdown-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avert a government shutdown</a>, but when it comes to passing the rest of President Biden’s agenda, including both an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/us/politics/government-shutdown-congress-infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious $3.5 trillion spending plan</a> and a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-passes-11-trillion-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-big/story?id=79378221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan infrastructure deal</a>, Democrats have much to sort out. It’s still too early to say how much jeopardy either bill is in — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-house-democrats-may-be-more-united-than-they-seem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assessing Democratic intraparty divisions is difficult</a> — but the fact that Senate Republicans have said <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/46-republican-senators-vow-not-233657646.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ll refuse</a> to help <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-mcconnell-stops-schumers-latest-attempt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise the debt ceiling</a> creates a real legislative challenge for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/treasury-secretary-warns-calamity-congress-raise-debt-limit/story?id=80283655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said the U.S. could run out of money as early as Oct. 18</a>, making it impossible for the U.S. to pay its current financial obligations and creating a risk of debt default that she said would be a “calamity” for the economy. And because almost all Senate Republicans have indicated they won’t vote to raise the debt ceiling, they’ve now created a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/politics/debt-limit-house-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game of chicken</a> in which they are arguing that Democrats alone must pass an increase <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2021-05-25_IN11681_619c43d079c47dc0723890acd6318b5b1cd01e60.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through budget reconciliation,</a> while Democrats counter that the GOP should join them in a bipartisan vote to raise it, which is generally how it <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to work in the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, at this point, a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/27/debt-ceiling-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new poll from Politico/Morning Consult</a> suggests public opinion may not push either party to change course, especially Republicans. Overall, 31 percent of registered voters said they would mostly blame Democrats if the country defaults on its debt, while 20 percent said they would primarily blame the GOP. However, the plurality (39 percent) said they would blame both parties equally, while 11 percent said they didn’t know or had no opinion.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also torn on whether to raise the debt ceiling, even though there could be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/09/28/how-worried-should-we-be-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-lifted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severely damaging ramifications</a> for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-default-6-million-jobs-15-trillion-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to raise it</a>. A survey conducted earlier this week by <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/574495-what-americas-thinking-september-29-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hill/HarrisX</a> found that 54 percent of registered voters opposed raising the cap, while 46 percent supported the raise. (The poll didn’t include some kind of “don’t know” option, which, as we’ll see, may be important.) Meanwhile, a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/ab8vvo6g3z/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly poll from The Economist/YouGov</a> found that 34 percent of adults favored raising it and 32 percent opposed, with the remaining 34 percent undecided. In both surveys, Republicans were strongly opposed to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats were about as strongly inclined to support an increase. Independents’ stance on the issue was murkier, but the polls suggested that these voters were slightly more opposed to raising the debt ceiling than they were supportive of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s likely that many Americans don’t understand what the debt ceiling is or what raising it entails. Consider the high share of respondents who said they were unsure in The Economist/YouGov’s survey. Part of what’s tricky here is the debt ceiling refers to <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt and financial obligations the U.S. has already accrued</a> — such as interest on the country’s debt or previously authorized spending, like Social Security benefits. That is, the debt limit is not a tool that authorizes <em>new</em> spending, as such expenditures are decided in completely separate legislation, like a bill for the next federal budget.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, we don’t have recent polling that examines Americans’ understanding of the debt limit, but past polls back up the idea that many people don’t grasp what it is or what the risks are if it’s not increased. In a 2013 <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/4rsof3kpkv/tabs_HP_debt_limit_20131016%20TABS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HuffPost/YouGov</a> poll, for instance, 42 percent of Americans correctly responded that a higher debt ceiling allowed the country to pay interest on its debt and spending that’s already been authorized, but 39 percent mistakenly said that the debt ceiling directly increased government spending and the amount of debt the U.S. holds. This survey also found plenty of uncertainty, as 20 percent said they weren’t sure what raising the debt ceiling meant. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2011/05/24/more-concern-about-raising-debt-limit-than-government-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll by the Washington Post/Pew Research Center</a> from 2011 — when the debt-ceiling debate <a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/a-familiar-landmine-the-looming-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was particularly fraught</a> — also reflected a misunderstanding of the consequences of raising or not raising the debt limit. In the poll, more Americans were worried about what would happen if the debt ceiling was raised than if it wasn’t: 48 percent were more concerned that raising the debt ceiling would lead to more spending and debt, while 35 percent were more worried that not raising the cap would force a debt default and cause economic harm. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The political consequences of the public’s general lack of understanding are important, though, because it may guide the parties’ position on the debt ceiling. And Republicans may benefit the most, as their current opposition to raising the debt ceiling might be viewed by voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/politics/republicans-block-government-funding-bill-debt-limit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as part of their rejection of Democrats’ spending plans</a>. This comes despite the fact that the debt-limit debate is about paying off existing financial obligations — like previously authorized spending and interest on debt accrued <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by past administrations from both parties</a> — rather than any future obligations that the Democrats’ budget proposal might generate. Just how the debt-limit fight will sort itself out in the coming weeks is unclear, but should neither party blink or come to a bipartisan resolution, the country would enter uncharted territory, facing potentially disastrous financial fallout. And in that case, the question of which party is to blame might be a lot more complicated for voters.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1">Over 650 people</a> who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 seeking to overturn the 2020 election have been arrested and charged. But as the FBI tries to identify more rioters, 48 percent of U.S. adults thought the penalties were not severe enough, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/28/declining-share-of-republicans-say-it-is-important-to-prosecute-jan-6-rioters/?utm_content=buffer5d7b4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Pew Research Center poll</a> that asked about the storming of the Capitol and the related House investigation. Yet, 57 percent of Republicans said there was already too much attention on Jan. 6, and Americans overall are unconfident in the investigation’s fairness, with a majority of Americans (54 percent) not too confident or not at all confident.</li><li>The Hispanic population represents 51 percent of the U.S. population growth between 2010 and 2020, with 19 percent of the country now identifying as either Hispanic or Latino, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html">data from the 2020 census</a>. The majority of Hispanic Americans (54 percent) don’t have a preference on whether they describe themselves as Hispanic or Latino, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/23/who-is-hispanic/?utm_content=bufferb2d71&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">according to Pew</a>. However, when it comes to Latinx, only 3 percent of Hispanic Americans use the term and another 76 percent said they haven’t even heard of it.</li><li>On Tuesday, Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/latest-pakistan-begin-vaccinating-children-12-80274052">submitted trial data</a> on COVID-19 vaccine use in children ages 5 to 11 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And this is good for some parents with kids under 12, as a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354998/covid-vaccine-young-child.aspx">recent Gallup poll</a> found that 55 percent of these parents said they would vaccinate their kids pending the FDA’s approval. And as the delta variant <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/22/delta-dominant-variant-mu-who/">continues to spread</a>, 53 percent of parents of children under 18 were worried their child would contract the virus, and pluralities of parents of school-aged children said schools should require all students (47 percent) and teachers and staff (49 percent) to mask up.</li><li>The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine">approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine</a> on Aug. 23, and according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355073/vaccinated-delta-surge-fda-decision.aspx">September survey from Gallup</a>, 75 percent of U.S. adults said they were fully or partially vaccinated. And for the first time since Gallup began polling this question in January, a majority of Republicans (56 percent) were now fully or partially vaccinated. The share of vaccinated Republicans grew 6 percentage points since August. By comparison, 92 percent of Democrats were fully or partially vaccinated.</li><li>John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate, said every country needs to act fast on climate change in a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weve-speed-top-us-climate-negotiator-john-kerry/story?id=80194945">recent interview with ABC News</a> ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference. But a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/09/14/in-response-to-climate-change-citizens-in-advanced-economies-are-willing-to-alter-how-they-live-and-work/">Pew survey</a> of 17 countries found that people thought the world was doing O.K. on climate change. A median of 56 percent of people polled thought their own society was doing a good job handling global climate change. But that doesn’t mean they were confident that this action would make a difference. The same survey found that a median of 52 percent of those polled were not confident that efforts by the international community would significantly reduce the effects of climate change.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, the FBI released nationwide crime statistics for 2020, which will likely contribute to the already tense political debate over crime and policing. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-crime-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The data</a> showed a nearly 30 percent increase in murders compared with the year prior, the largest spike since national record-keeping began in 1960. Nevertheless, murder rates are significantly below what they were throughout the 1990s. Overall, violent crime increased by nearly 6 percent, while property crimes went down by 8 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Crime analyst and co-founder of AH Datalytics <a href="https://www.ahdatalytics.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Asher</a> joins the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a> to unpack the numbers in the report. He discusses what the trends can and can’t tell us about what caused the spike, how crime data is gathered and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-convinced-crime-is-rising-in-the-u-s-theyre-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how Americans perceive the crime rate</a>.</p>
