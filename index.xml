<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats are feeling pretty buoyant these days. Last week, they won a highly competitive special election in New York’s 19th Congressional District, which came on the heels of other <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stronger-than-expected special election performances</a> since the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-overturns-roe-wade-landmark-case-abortion/story?id=85160781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court’s June 24 decision</a> to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion. And earlier this month, pro-abortion rights forces <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-abortion-is-becoming-a-winning-issue-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned back</a> a state constitutional amendment in Kansas that would have allowed for an abortion ban there. Finally, the two parties are also running neck and neck <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in generic ballot polling</a>, which asks voters whether they plan to vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate this fall, after Republicans led by about 2 percentage points prior to the Dobbs ruling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet if we zero in on the House, the overall terrain is still quite favorable to the GOP. After all, FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 midterm election forecast</a> still gives Republicans about a better than 3 in 4 shot of capturing the lower chamber.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deluxe version, as of 5 p.m. Eastern on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>



<figure><div>
<img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/2022-house-change-711-2.png"></div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The GOP has lost ground in the forecast since June, but its continued edge comes down to factors such as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geography</a> (Democrats are <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/vrdi/files/2018/06/Chen-Rodden-unintentional.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concentrated</a> in metropolitan areas), <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-new-national-congressional-map-is-biased-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> (Republicans once again have more favorable seats) and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history</a> (the president’s party almost always loses House seats in midterms). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s one more factor that could really help Republicans this fall: More Democrats than Republicans are leaving the House, either via retirement or to run for another office. Overall, 31 Democrats are departing, compared with just 18 Republicans.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These calculations include Rep. Ted Deutch, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/politics/ted-deutch-retiring-congressman-florida/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;who announced his retirement in February&lt;/a&gt; but also his intention to resign this fall, which will be too late to hold a pre-November special election for his seat. The totals do not, however, include members who announced their retirements but then resigned and were replaced in special elections, such as Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas. The count also doesn’t include members who won special elections during this Congress but are not seeking a full term in November 2022, such as Republican Rep. Connie Conway of California. Finally, these totals do not include members who lost renomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> To be sure, this is a <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/exit-stage-left-or-right-midterm-retirements-and-open-seats-in-the-u-s-house-from-1974-to-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common midterm trend</a> — House members from the president’s party tend to leave Congress in greater numbers because the midterms usually go poorly for their side. But Republicans need to flip just four seats to gain a majority in the House,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats have 221 seats and Republicans 214 if we assign the incumbent party to each vacant seat. However, this might change by one seat if Democrats win the special election for Alaska’s At-Large District, where votes are still being counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> and it’s possible GOP victories in seats left behind by outgoing Democrats will account for at least that many. The table below lays out the most competitive districts that these Democrats and Republicans won’t be contesting. </p>

 <p>The partisan lean is based on the district maps that will be used in the 2022 election, with outgoing representatives assigned to the seat that they most likely would have run in had they sought reelection. Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Not every House departure gives Republicans a leg up, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most districts are relatively safe for one party</a>, which you can see at the end of this article where we present the data for all 49 outgoing members. However, if we look at the most competitive districts that are up for election — defined as having partisan leans between D+15 and R+15<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> — we can clearly see that Democrats were more likely to have abandoned these seats than Republicans. In total, 13 Democrats left these kinds of seats versus just five Republicans, which means more Democratic-held seats are now in danger. Incumbency <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/681670?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t nearly as strong</a> of an electoral boon as it was in the past, but it’s still likely that Democratic incumbents would have outperformed a replacement-level nominee from their party.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigning outgoing representatives to the seat they most likely would have run in was straightforward in most cases, but a few members’ districts were significantly altered in redistricting; this is especially true in districts that aren’t that competitive. For instance, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan’s seat became considerably redder in Ohio’s map, with his old 13th District divided fairly evenly among three seats in Ohio’s new map. In such cases as these, we assigned representatives to the new district that had the largest share of the population from their old district, so Ryan was assigned to the new 14th District, where 39 percent of his current constituents live. You can see a table of all the representatives departing Congress at the end of the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To put this into context, I looked back at the terrain in 2018, when Democrats won 40 seats to take back the House <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amid a strongly pro-Democratic environment</a>. That year, far more Republicans (39) than Democrats (18) retired or sought another office; however, there wasn’t quite the same pattern in Republicans vacating competitive turf — Republicans left 14 seats open with a partisan lean between D+15 and R+15, while Democrats left 10. But thanks to the especially strong environment for Democrats, who won the House popular vote by almost 9 percentage points, Democrats captured 11 of those 14 formerly Republican seats while losing just two of the other 10.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Compared with 2018, though, the 2022 generic ballot polling points to a far more competitive environment, which means Republicans can’t count on sweeping these competitive seats. (Although, we should note that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the generic ballot tends to underestimate</a> Republicans.) That said, this cycle’s Democratic departures have still presented Republicans with a number of flippable seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To name a few: Arizona’s independent redistricting commission <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted the state’s southeastern district to the right</a>, and while Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/only-11-house-members-have-said-theyre-not-running-again-heres-why-thats-important-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired well before the map was finalized</a>, Democrats might wish she’d stuck around to defend an R+7 seat that now looks <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like a good bet to go Republican</a>. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Ron Kind’s GOP-leaning 3rd District in western Wisconsin <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t change much in redistricting</a>, but Kind’s <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/04/ron-kind-derrick-van-orden-wisconsin-3rd-congressional-district-race-us-house/6130509002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close 2020 victory</a> over Republican Derrick Van Orden suggested it’d be tough to hold, and with the 13-term incumbent now retiring, Van Orden <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/wisconsin/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks favored to win the seat</a> this November. Finally, in western Illinois, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic mapmakers actually made</a> Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos’s 17th District <em>bluer</em> — it shifted from R+5 to D+4 — but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/30/cheri-bustos-announces-retirement-485109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bustos had already announced her retirement</a>, and now the seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/illinois/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is rated as a toss-up in our forecast</a> with Bustos’s 2020 opponent, Republican Esther Joy King, facing Democrat Eric Sorensen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that Democrats are also slight favorites in some competitive seats their incumbents left behind, but those districts are far from safe — especially if the environment gets better for the GOP as we get into the fall, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often happens for the out party</a> in midterm elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Failed runs for higher office by Reps. Conor Lamb (U.S. Senate) and Tom Suozzi (governor) have still left marginally Democratic-leaning seats open in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 17th District</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 3rd District</a>. Meanwhile, Colorado Democratic Rep. Ed Perlmutter announced his retirement <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-28-house-democrats-arent-running-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the suburban-Denver-based 7th District</a> after the state’s independent redistricting commission <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it a D+6 seat</a>. As such, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/colorado/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s favored to remain Democratic</a>, although it is still far more competitive than it would have been under the old D+15 lines. Finally, in eastern North Carolina, Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article255896141.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left behind the state’s 1st District</a> when the GOP-controlled legislature <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/cst_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">erased its Democratic-leaning advantage</a>, but the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court-drawn map</a> that replaced the legislature’s lines gave Democrats a bit of a reprieve, giving <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/north-carolina/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the formerly D+7 seat</a> a partisan lean of D+5.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are limits to incumbency, though, as it’s unlikely incumbency would have saved Democrats’ chances in four seats in Florida, Ohio and Tennessee, where Republican-drawn maps have probably ensured GOP wins. For instance, Reps. Charlie Crist and Stephanie Murphy’s seats <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharply shifted to the right in Florida</a>, while Rep. Tim Ryan’s seat was <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obliterated in Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Jim Cooper’s Nashville-area seat</a> swung all the way from D+17 to R+15. (As some of these districts fell outside the competitive range, you can see some of these members in the table below.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans, meanwhile, just don’t have as many departures that threaten GOP control. Just two seats in New York might cost Republicans: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/14/1073112515/republican-rep-john-katko-who-voted-for-trumps-impeachment-is-retiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. John Katko’s seat in the 22nd,</a> which has a slight Democratic lean, though Katko <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/2020s-crossover-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had prevailed under these conditions before</a>, and Rep. Lee Zeldin’s seat in the 1st District, which ultimately retained a partisan lean of R+5 and is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat favored to remain in GOP hands</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, we’re not talking about a <em>huge</em> number of seats affected by departures this year, but every seat counts in a political universe with fewer swing seats and more dark-blue and dark-red turf. Moreover, the disproportionate number of Democratic departures and the fact that many have come in potentially competitive seats could give the GOP a boost in November. Republicans only need to flip four seats to gain the barest of majorities, so anything that bolsters their chances is meaningful.</p>

 <p>The partisan lean is based on the district maps that will be used in the 2022 election, with outgoing representatives assigned to the seat that they most likely would have run in had they sought reelection. Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When Kansas voters <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kansas-abortion-vote-recount-e874f56806a9d63b473b24580ad7ea0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a> rejected a ballot initiative that would have made it easier for the state legislature to restrict or ban abortion, it was only the latest example of otherwise red-state voters backing a measure seemingly out of step with their usual politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past decade, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Minimum_wage_on_the_ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters in 12 states</a> have passed minimum wage increases, including states as reliably Republican as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/upshot/election-results-2014-minimum-wage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Dakota</a> and <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article221172400.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a>. <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/medicaid-expansion-ballot-measures-brewing-in-three-more-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six red states have also expanded Medicaid eligibility</a> via ballot initiative after their Republican legislatures failed to do so under the new rules created by the Affordable Care Act. And since a nationwide movement to legalize marijuana began in the late 1990s, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_marijuana_on_the_ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a whopping 36 states have either legalized or decriminalized medical marijuana</a>, including by ballot initiative in conservative states <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Marijuana_laws_and_ballot_measures_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Utah and Oklahoma</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the reason these measures have passed is because <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’re popular</a>. Still, in many of these cases, they were unlikely to have passed Republican-controlled state legislatures. It’s why in some states, the state legislatures are now pushing back, trying to make it harder to pass ballot measures. “We do see a direct relationship between progressive measures passing in red states and legislators creating barriers to the ballot initiative process, or really looking to eliminate it all together,” said Corrine Rivera Fowler, the director of policy and legal advocacy at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a progressive group that organizes to put initiatives on the ballot around the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, in turn, perhaps raises a more fundamental question: Why do voters in these states so frequently support progressive ballot legislation while also voting for candidates who oppose these very efforts? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Arkansas, in particular, is an interesting case. One of the only states in the South <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/chart-of-the-initiative-states.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to have a ballot initiative system</a> for amending the state constitution <em>and</em> passing new state laws, it also <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Signature_requirements_for_ballot_measures_in_Arkansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fairly low threshold</a> for getting issues onto the ballot.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mississippi had a process similar to Arkansas’s, but it was &lt;a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/05/31/mississippi-ballot-initiative-state-law-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;struck down by the courts&lt;/a&gt;. Florida, meanwhile, has a ballot initiative system for amending the state constitution, but not for passing new state laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> Moreover, ballot initiatives in the state require just a simple majority to pass. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Using ballot initiatives, Arkansas voters have in the last decade <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arkansas_Issue_5,_Minimum_Wage_Increase_Initiative_(2018)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased the state’s minimum wage</a> twice and <a href="https://static.ark.org/eeuploads/arml/Arkansas_Medical_Marijuana_Amendment_of_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legalized medical marijuana</a> (the first Southern state to do so). This November, meanwhile, voters can decide whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use, although whether the votes will be counted <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/arkansas-supreme-court-orders-state-to-put-marijuana-legalization-initiative-on-ballot-but-votes-may-not-be-counted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remains in legal limbo</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Partly because of the success of these efforts, Arkansas will also vote on another ballot initiative in November: Issue 2, which has been pushed forward by the state legislature and will make ballot initiatives more difficult to pass. Ballot initiatives, whether they are for statutes or constitutional amendments, would require a 60 percent majority rather than a simple majority in order to pass. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The initiative’s sponsor, state Rep. David Ray, a Republican from a suburb of Little Rock, <a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2022-02-24/coalition-forms-to-oppose-arkansas-measure-requiring-supermajority-to-pass-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told a local NPR affiliate</a> that the state’s process that allows voters to pass laws and to amend the state constitution was too easy. “That process is fairly easy for big money or out-of-state interests to hijack because all they have to do is spend a large sum of money in a relatively short window of time and temporarily convince people that something is a good idea,” <a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2022-02-24/coalition-forms-to-oppose-arkansas-measure-requiring-supermajority-to-pass-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray said</a>. “And then viola, it’s in the constitution forever and ever.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t the first time the Arkansas state legislature has tried to change the ballot initiative process. In 2020, it referred a constitutional amendment that would increase the number of signatures required <a href="https://www.sos.arkansas.gov/uploads/elections/Issue_3_for_Website.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get initiatives on the ballot</a>, but the amendment <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arkansas_Issue_3,_Initiative_Process_and_Legislative_Referral_Requirements_Amendment_(2020)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost 56 to 44 percent</a>. And this year, state legislatures in <a href="https://azpbs.org/horizon/2022/08/proposition-128-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> and South Dakota, along with Arkansas, all proposed ballot initiatives that would change the ballot initiative process, either making it harder for voters to pass measures or granting the state legislature more control over the process. In Colorado, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Include_Income_Tax_Effects_in_Initiative_Ballot_Language_Measure_(2022)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ballot initiative would require fiscal impact summaries</a> to be prepared before signature gathering and displayed on petitions, adding steps to the process. South Dakota voters <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Constitutional_Amendment_C,_60%25_Vote_Requirement_for_Ballot_Measures_Increasing_Taxes_or_Appropriating_%2410_Million_Measure_(June_2022)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected that effort</a> in their state’s June primary. The Arkansas measure also doesn’t seem popular: A February poll from Talk Business &amp; Politics and Hendrix College found that 53 percent of people said they’d <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2022/02/poll-marijuana-legalization-growing-in-popularity-higher-threshold-on-ballot-issues-unpopular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably or definitely vote against it</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if these measures fail, legislatures still have other methods at their disposal that could make ballot initiatives harder to pass, or to get them in front of voters in the first place. They can pass laws on their own that add new requirements around the <a href="https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills221/hlrbillspdf/4678H.01I.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">language</a> for proposals, the rules around <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/76387?SessionId=125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtaining the</a> <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0218.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signatures</a> <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=2021-SB-0308&amp;query=on" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required</a> to get initiatives on the ballot or require <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/22624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra</a> or earlier steps to the approval process. “As you see states become more single-minded, that means some states are going to try to rein in the mechanisms of control that are out there,” Craig Burnett, a political scientist at Hofstra University, said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While people <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40421585?read-now=1&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally seem to like ballot initiatives</a>, there is good evidence that voters don’t know a lot about most ballot initiatives before they reach the voting booth. Political scientists Janine Parry of the University of Arkansas, Jay Barth of Hendrix College in Arkansas and Burnett found in a 2019 paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330691258_Direct_Democracy_Educative_Effects_and_the_MisMeasurement_of_Ballot_Measure_Awareness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that only about 24 to 30 percent</a> of voters could identify a single ballot initiative before going to the polls in two election years in Arkansas, 2014 and 2016. “There’s some breakthrough with … morals issues, the things that folks have an opinion on,” Barth said. “But that’s kind of the exception rather than the rule.” That paper also argued that many of the ways political scientists have tried to measure what voters know about ballot initiatives before they go to the polls actually overestimates voter knowledge. This means the ballot initiative might not always deliver on its promises of a more engaged and informed electorate, especially if voters <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/11/6/21549654/california-ballot-initiative-proposition-direct-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are asked to make too many complicated decisions</a> they don’t have time to research.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the time, though, it doesn’t matter that voters aren’t steeped in the details of ballot initiatives. In fact, it actually might be a good thing, as it means voters aren’t relying on partisanship heuristics and other clues to make their choices. Instead, the first time many voters learn about ballot initiatives is when they see them in the voting booth, and they make their decisions then.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that ballot initiatives are often separated from politics might make these measures easier for some voters to support, too. People identify with a party for many more reasons than one issue alone, and so they’re not going to change their party affiliation or vote over something like a ballot measure. “The power of partisanship is very strong,” Barth said. “At the end of the day, [voters] can have Republicans in office who share many of their values, but they still, through the direct democracy process, can get these certain policies that they care a lot about put in place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because voters often don’t know much about ballot initiatives before voting, they’re also not usually comparing them to candidates’ stances on those issues, either. Moreover, candidates can be incentivized to not take a stand: There might be an initiative that’s popular with the state overall but not with their base or with their district. “The average legislator, I think probably very smartly, would dodge those questions, right? They’d say, ‘Well, it’s, it’s up to the people to decide,’” Burnett said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kansas’s abortion vote is a good example of the difference between partisan incentives and voter preference. Before the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in June, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only about 10 to 15 percent of voters</a> nationwide supported the sorts of near-total bans that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/09/republicans-keep-passing-extreme-anti-abortion-bans-without-popular-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republican-led state legislatures are passing</a>. But a key component of the Republican Party’s base, white evangelicals, is <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2022/january/evangelical-abortion-views-age-gap-younger-pro-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more likely</a> to think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases than the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">population as a whole</a>, which is part of the reason the party is enacting those unpopular laws. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why in Kansas, the group organizing voters against the recent amendment emphasized broad common ground on the issue of abortion — rather than talking about specific kinds of restrictions, which can divide <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/abortion-birth-control-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more sharply along partisan lines</a>. “I think what we did that was important was that we made it OK for people to have differing views on choice,” said Ashley All, the communications director for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, a bipartisan group that opposed amending the state constitution. “Regardless of their personal beliefs about the issue … they always came back to the fact that they believe that should be a decision that a woman can make for herself and her family.” She said Kansan voters didn’t see the issue in terms of pro-life or pro-choice, but instead as “fundamental rights to make decisions about your own body.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s also another component to this: Voters seem to like the idea of constraining the legislature instead of giving them total control over the democratic process. After all, Kansans chose to keep a previous constitutional amendment that enshrined abortion rights so that the legislature <em>couldn’t</em> pass stricter laws. Barth says another ballot initiative may test this idea in November in Arkansas. The legislature also put an initiative on the ballot that would give legislators the <a href="https://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/141076/for-these-issues-thank-your-lawmakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ability to call themselves into a special legislative session</a>, which currently, only the governor has the ability to do. This is largely in response to <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2021/04/panel-advances-proposed-constitutional-amendment-to-allow-legislature-to-call-itself-into-special-session/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the emergency measures Gov. Asa Hutchinson enacted</a> during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I do think it’s going to be a real test on where folks come down on how much power the legislature should have,” Barth said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what the Kansas votes, and all of these votes, might underscore is that the mood is shifting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision, at least on abortion. An Ipsos/USA Today Poll published Aug. 10 found that <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/state-level-abortion-ballots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent of respondents</a> would support their state using a ballot measure to determine abortion rights at the state level. “This is such a hot issue, and the numbers are so stable in terms of public opinion … are people going to be wanting their elected representatives to take positions on [abortion initiatives]?” Burnett said. “That, I think, is something new.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Burnett said this could be true with other similarly easy-to-understand issues that voters already have strong attitudes about, which could raise the profile of ballot initiatives more generally. Rivera Fowler says her group is working to add ballot initiatives to 2024 ballots in many states that would help bolster, rather than attack, direct democracy in those states. Additionally, while the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center doesn’t campaign for or support particular candidates, it is working with state partners to educate voters more on how these issues are linked, and that the actions candidates take, or don’t take, once they’re in office matter, too. “Voters are not connecting policy and politics,” she said. “And we need to help them understand that those two are very much related.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">After plenty of back-and-forth within the Democratic Party, President Biden announced a plan to use executive action to forgive up to $20,000 of student loan debt per person last week. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses which Americans will be impacted and how the executive action will impact politics and the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then the team debates if a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/25/upshot/female-voters-dobbs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a> of voter registration data showing a surge of women registering to vote after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion is a good or bad use of data. Finally, the crew analyzes why Biden’s approval rating has increased by nearly 5 percentage points since late July.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When former President Donald Trump was in the White House, he bragged on Twitter, “As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win!” And he was right: In Republican primaries in 2018 and 2020, a Trump endorsement was like a golden ticket to the general election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now that he is out of office, though, Trump’s endorsees are not winning as often as they used to — a potential concern for the ex-president as he considers another presidential campaign in 2024. But that doesn’t mean his influence in the party is waning. Rather, the decline in Trump’s endorsement win rate probably has more to do with him picking tougher fights than with voters turning their backs on him. And in absolute terms, his endorsees still win far more often than they lose. So while there are signs that Trump’s influence within the GOP is slipping, he remains a powerful figure within the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the surface, Trump’s endorsement record is almost perfect. According to data collected by FiveThirtyEight, the ex-president has endorsed 189 Republican candidates in Senate, House and gubernatorial primaries that have taken place through Aug. 23.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we are only counting candidates who had Trump’s endorsement on the day of their primary. That means we are not counting Rep. Mo Brooks, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/04/trump-gives-mo-brooks-complete-and-total-endorsement-in-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Alabama Senate&lt;/a&gt; only to later &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/03/trump-pulls-mo-brooks-endorsement-new-alabama-senate-endorsement-coming-soon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rescind his endorsement&lt;/a&gt;; Michigan state Rep. Steve Carra, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.sturgisjournal.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/08/donald-trump-has-endorsed-steve-carra-bid-unseat-u-s-rep-fred-upton/5762731001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Congress&lt;/a&gt; but who eventually &lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2022/03/after-trump-endorses-opponent-state-rep-steve-carra-drops-out-of-race-for-us-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dropped out&lt;/a&gt;; former Trump administration official Morgan Ortagus, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.mainstreet-nashville.com/news/trump-endorses-ortagus-to-represent-nashville-in-congress/article_d9976c4c-7ed2-11ec-940f-3bf4432ffc7e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Congress&lt;/a&gt; but who &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/20/morgan-ortagus-baxter-lee-robby-starbuck-removed-tennessee-republican-primary/7381732001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;did not qualify for the ballot&lt;/a&gt;; or Army veteran Sean Parnell, whom Trump &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/trump-endorses-sean-parnell-pennsylvania-senate-race-20210901.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed for Pennsylvania Senate&lt;/a&gt; but who &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/sean-parnell-custody-decision-pa-senate-2022-20211122.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suspended his campaign&lt;/a&gt; amid scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> And 180 of them — 95 percent — won the Republican nomination or advanced to the general election.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Alaska’s, California’s and Washington’s all-party primaries, multiple candidates from the same party can make the November ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we shouldn’t take that statistic at face value. A lot of these endorsements were of candidates who would almost certainly win anyway — an example of Trump padding his win rate to exaggerate his clout. For instance, 61 of the candidates Trump endorsed faced no opposition, and another 84 were incumbents, who rarely lose their primaries. In fact, only one Trump-endorsed incumbent lost: Rep. Madison Cawthorn. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/latest-trump-investigations-impact-midterms-88771394</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">That means of Trump’s 189 endorsements, just 44 were of nonincumbents in contested primaries — the riskiest kind of endorsements to make.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 45 percent of Trump’s endorsements at that point fell into this “risky” category, a significantly higher share than in 2020. However, as the primary season unfolded, Trump &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-70-percent-of-trumps-endorsees-believe-the-2020-election-was-fraudulent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;loaded up&lt;/a&gt; on incumbent and uncontested endorsements, and now these “risky” endorsements constitute just 23 percent of the total. That’s basically identical to the 2020 cycle (22 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> And only 36 of these candidates won — giving Trump a lower win rate of 82 percent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">An 82 percent win rate would be the envy of most endorsers, but for Trump, it’s a bit of a letdown. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2020</a>, those same types of candidates won 96 percent of their races (24 out of 25), and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-looked-at-hundreds-of-endorsements-heres-who-republicans-are-listening-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2018</a>, his win rate among this group was 89 percent (17 out of 19).<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the win rates in the linked articles are slightly different. The 2020 article was published before the end of primary season, and the 2018 article did not include races in which Trump endorsed against an incumbent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One big reason for this decrease is that Trump took a different endorsement strategy this year: He actively tried <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to defeat many sitting governors and members of Congress</a>, who of course are very difficult to beat. In total, Trump endorsed 10 nonincumbents who were running against incumbents,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including his former aide Max Miller, whom redistricting put in the same district as Rep. Bob Gibbs. Gibbs ended up &lt;a href="https://www.cantonrep.com/story/news/2022/04/06/congressman-bob-gibbs-retire/9482327002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;withdrawing from the race&lt;/a&gt;, but his name was still on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> and just six of them won or advanced to the general election — a 60 percent win rate that goes a long way toward explaining Trump’s lower overall win rate in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, more of these bets paid off than didn’t, and notably, Trump used these endorsements to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-70-percent-of-trumps-endorsees-believe-the-2020-election-was-fraudulent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reshape the party in his image</a>. In total, six of the incumbents he targeted for defeat supported the effort to impeach him for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and only two of them survived: Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because of Alaska’s new top-four primary system, Trump’s endorsee &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; advanced to the general election. This race won’t truly be resolved until November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Trump embarked on a crusade this year to rid the party of his critics, and it was largely successful. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s win rate in incumbent-less contested primaries (30 out of 34, or 88 percent) was also lower than in 2020 (96 percent), but it wasn’t unprecedented; he had the same win rate in these types of primaries in 2018. This may have been because Trump endorsed some pretty flawed candidates this cycle, too. Three of the four losers in this category faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Eight women accused business owner Charles Herbster (who ran for Nebraska governor) of <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unwanted sexual advances</a>. Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (who ran for Senate) allegedly <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/woman-testifies-that-greitens-groped-and-hit-her-governor-blasts-lies-and-tabloid-trash/article_23265ac0-6cfe-597e-9b62-92df8d0b1e62.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit, groped and blackmailed</a> a woman he was having an affair with, in addition to allegedly coercing her to perform oral sex.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article263965801.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endorsed two candidates&lt;/a&gt; in this race, so he was guaranteed to notch a loss regardless. He endorsed “ERIC,” which was &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/lobbying-trumps-missouri-endorsement-00049183" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;designed to cover&lt;/a&gt; both Greitens and state Attorney General Eric Schmitt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> And former state Rep. Vernon Jones (who ran for Georgia’s 10th District) was <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/rape-allegation-shadows-vernon-jones/85-4efb1016-2350-48bf-9a9c-69a87003e465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused of rape</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of these failed endorsements also suggest (surely to Trump’s chagrin) that, when the Republican establishment decides to go toe-to-toe with him, the establishment sometimes wins. In the Nebraska gubernatorial primary, the state’s outgoing governor <a href="https://www.wowt.com/2022/01/18/gov-ricketts-endorses-jim-pillen-nebraska-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, who wound up defeating Herbster. And in the Missouri Senate race, major Republican donors and allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/eric-greitens-attempted-comeback-00049388" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent millions of dollars</a> to stop Greitens. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, several of Trump’s losses in this category were limited to Georgia, a particularly brutal state for Trump this cycle. Republicans there rejected not only Jones but also attorney Jake Evans (who ran in the 6th District) and former Sen. David Perdue (who ran for governor against incumbent Brian Kemp). Notably, Trump’s endorsees for <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-attorney-general-chris-carr-jen-jordan-headed-for-november-showdown/HMFS42LPQJF2DDIAF43BMNKLRA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general</a>, <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/05/25/raffensperger-declares-victory-over-election-denialism-in-georgia-gop-secretary-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secretary of state</a> and <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2022/05/26/669359.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurance commissioner</a> also lost in Georgia, but those last three don’t show up in our numbers since we don’t track down-ballot races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, Trump’s endorsement has not been a silver bullet. Other factors, such as incumbency or candidate weakness, sometimes overcame it. But it’s also important to remember that these losses are exceptions to the rule; his endorsement still carries a lot of weight. For instance, we said just a few paragraphs ago that a 60 percent win rate against incumbents was low — and for Trump, it is — but it’s also remarkably high when you consider that incumbents historically win renomination <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of the time</a> or more!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider, too, how many candidates probably wouldn’t have won without Trump’s endorsement. It’s difficult to quantify exactly how many votes Trump’s endorsement is worth, but take someone like author J.D. Vance. He was languishing in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRF-OH-22-Sen-GOP-Primary-0414-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second</a>, <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/OH-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-March-2-6_release-March-8-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third</a> or even <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1514671343052242951?s=20&amp;t=pGEtbZjhrIZ_2n8JjRRrtA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth</a> place in the GOP primary for Ohio Senate until Trump <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/04/donald-trump-endorses-jd-vance-in-ohios-crowded-republican-us-senate-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>. Then he led in almost <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/OH-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-April-20-24_release-April-26-....pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-OH-Sen-GOP-0501-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public</a> <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/ohio-2022-poll-trump-endorsement-boosts-jd-vance-in-four-way-ohio-senate-race-governor-dewine-holds-lead-for-republican-nomination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of the race — and eventually triumphed over a divided field, with 32 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, former TV anchor Kari Lake was a conspiracy theorist who had never run for office before, but with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/07/trump-gop-kari-lake-00050215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump in her corner</a>, she won the Republican nomination for Arizona governor over a candidate backed by much of the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/18/mike-pence-endorses-karrin-taylor-robson-arizona-governor/10083790002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP</a> <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/ducey-endorses-karrin-taylor-robson-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishment</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Also in Arizona, venture capitalist and Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters had led only in polls sponsored by his supporters, but after Trump endorsed him in June, he led in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TRF-AZ-GOP-0612-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ArizonaResults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successive</a> <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/az-gop-senate-race-masters-of-his-own-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> and eventually won with 40 percent of the vote. In the primary for Wisconsin governor, meanwhile, business owner Tim Michels <a href="https://captimes.com/news/government/republican-tim-michels-launches-campaign-for-wisconsin-governor/article_52ea3fe6-045b-5071-a628-0861e6d823b6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race late</a> and won — erasing what had been a <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MLSP69Toplines.html#Q40a:_Rep_primary_for_Gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide lead</a> for former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch — thanks in part to <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/06/02/donald-trump-endorses-tim-michels-wisconsin-governor/7488047001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a>. And finally, Trump’s pick for Pennsylvania Senate, celebrity physician Mehmet Oz, also won his primary by just 953 votes; considering all of Oz’s baggage as a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/does-dr-oz-live-in-pennsylvania-20211202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey transplant</a> who once held <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-conservative-policy-pa-senate-race-20220419.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberal views on abortion and guns</a>, it seems very likely that he owes his win to Trump as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s more, some candidates who were probably already on their way to winning appeared to receive a nice boost in support after Trump endorsed them. State Sen. Doug Mastriano held only about a <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TRF-PA-GOP-Gov-Primary-0508-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-percentage-point lead</a> in <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2022/Toplines-PaGOPPrimary-SPR-May2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the GOP primary for Pennsylvania governor, but after Trump <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/05/14/doug-mastriano-donald-trump-pennsylvania-state-senate-governor-election-primary-republican/stories/202205140042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a> the weekend before the primary, Mastriano seemed to experience a surge in support, winning by more than 23 points. Similarly, <a href="https://mirs-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/4723-MI%20GOP%20GOV%20PRESS%20RELEASE-FIELD%20COPY-%20CROSSTABS%207-26-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent</a> <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MI-Gov-GOP-0728-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> of the Michigan gubernatorial primary taken just before Trump <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/29/trump-endorses-tudor-dixon-michigan-governor/10115243002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> TV commentator Tudor Dixon gave her only single-digit leads over her opponents, but a few days later, she won the primary by 18 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even some candidates who didn’t face serious competition benefited from Trump’s support in the <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/invisible-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invisible primary</a>, demonstrating his influence among GOP elites as well. For example, Trump’s very first endorsement of the cycle was of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, one of his former press secretaries, for Arkansas governor. At the time of his endorsement, there were two high-ranking Arkansas officeholders — Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge — in that race, but they eventually <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2021/02/griffin-to-exit-governors-race-will-seek-ag-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> and <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/nov/09/leslie-rutledge-drops-out-arkansas-governors-race-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared the field</a> for Sanders. Likewise, Trump’s support for former football player Herschel Walker for Senate in Georgia probably prevented stronger candidates, like <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2021/08/25/herschel-walker-running-for-senate-rep-buddy-carter-donald-trump-endorsement-raphael-warnock-georgia/5586553001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Buddy Carter</a>, from entering the race (in fact, Walker, who until recently lived in Texas, may not have run at all without <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/10/donald-trump-urges-herschel-walker-to-enter-georgia-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s urging</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if you were hoping that Trump’s 2022 endorsement record would give you a definitive answer about whether his grip on the GOP has weakened since leaving office, you’re out of luck. The best we can say is that it’s clear that his endorsement is often still pretty powerful — but it’s not invincible either. And that’s probably a good way to think about Trump’s future in the party, too. Polls show that he remains <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely popular</a> among the GOP base — but that a healthy slice of the party is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/us/politics/trump-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready to move on from him</a> with regard to 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, regardless of how far Republican voters are willing to follow Trump, it’s clear that they continue to crave the populist, illiberal ethos he represents. Consider that when his endorsed candidates did lose their primaries this year, it usually wasn’t to the anti-Trump wing of the party; it was to candidates who also embraced Trump even though he didn’t embrace them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The candidates who defeated Evans and Jones in Georgia, for instance, were still firm believers in Trump’s baseless claims that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-120-republicans-who-deny-the-2020-election-results-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a>. Meanwhile, even though Trump backed a challenger against him, Idaho Gov. Brad Little still <a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2020/12/11/gov-little-joins-with-idaho-gop-in-supporting-texas-lawsuit-on-election-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported a lawsuit</a> to overturn the election. And Rep. Nancy Mace, a <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/newsmaker-scs-nancy-mace-speaks-out-about-jan-6-and-her-former-boss-donald-trump/article_0134c7f8-61ce-11ec-8f9a-c317e9d5151b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocal critic of Trump’s actions on Jan. 6</a>, backtracked from that stance, releasing a <a href="https://m.facebook.com/nancyrmace/videos/im-standing-in-front-of-trump-tower-with-a-message-this-morningsc01-lowcountryfi/1054561101770084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fawning video in front of Trump Tower</a> during her primary. Even Kemp, who accepted the 2020 election’s legitimacy, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/kemp-counters-perdues-pro-trump-message-with-more-trump/4BRHOROHRJE5HJWQF4Y6XFRB34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired ads</a> that tapped into Trump’s “America First” nationalism. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, even if Trump’s personal influence on the GOP is waning, Trump<em>ism</em> is definitely here to stay.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Recently, an image that listed books banned in Florida libraries and schools began making the rounds on Twitter. The <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/florida-book-bans-schools-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 titles</a>, spanning classics from “To Kill a Mockingbird” to “A Wrinkle in Time,” caught the eyes of many, including <a href="https://twitter.com/rweingarten/status/1561516929826918402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Randi Weingarten</a>, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers, a major teacher’s labor union in the U.S. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Only one problem: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-florida-schools-to-kill-a-mockingbird-201081596097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The list was fake</a>. There is no banned-book list at the state level in Florida.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t to say that books haven’t been banned in Florida public schools. Earlier this year, the nonprofit organization <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-florida-texas-orlando-ron-desantis-282b16bfe9771d31786b670fdecd306c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEN America</a> reported that between July 2021 and March 2022, they’d found over 200 instances of book banning across seven Florida school districts. It’s just that these bans usually don’t include books like “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Rather, many of the books that banned in some districts in Florida — and elsewhere — are books that tackle <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/librarians-uniting-battle-school-book-ban-laws/story?id=83678096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race, gender identity and sexual orientation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lately, Republican-controlled states like Florida have experienced increased efforts to ban books that touch on these issues. In <a href="https://www.ala.org/news/sites/ala.org.news/files/content/State-of-Americas-Libraries-2020-web-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>, the American Library Association tracked 377 challenges to materials in schools, libraries and universities, and in <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/banned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a>, the ALA tracked 729 — an increase of over 90 percent. And as we head into a new academic year, some students are already attending schools where their reading options are now more restricted. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/18/1117708153/bible-anne-frank-books-banned-texas-school-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keller, Texas</a>, for example, over 40 books have been banned this year, including a graphic-novel adaptation of “The Diary of Anne Frank” as well as multiple texts with LGBTQ characters. And in some parts of the country, there aren’t book bans, per se, but <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/central-bucks-schools-book-ban-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community members can challenge any book</a> taught in schools that they find to be inappropriate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet polls suggest that most Americans aren’t on board with banning books, not even those on controversial topics. In February, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/book-bans-opinion-poll-2022-02-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CBS News/YouGov poll</a> found that 87 percent of Americans opposed bans on books that discuss race, and the same share opposed bans on books depicting slavery. This aligns with two other polls from this year: A <a href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Harris-March-2022-topline-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UChicago Harris/AP-NORC survey</a> from March found that only 12 percent of Americans supported schools banning books that concern “divisive topics,” and <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/voters-oppose-book-bans-libraries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a March poll</a> by Hart Research Associates/North Star Opinion Research, on behalf of the ALA, found that 71 percent of voters opposed efforts to remove books from public libraries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the ALA poll found little difference between Republicans (70 percent) and Democrats (75 percent) on the issue. Similarly, that CBS News/YouGov poll found that Americans on both sides of the political aisle were opposed to banning books, although it also found stark differences when it came to how issues of race should be taught in the classroom, and it’s this divide that has muddied the banned-book debate currently raging in schools.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, even though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-anti-critical-race-theory-bills-are-taking-aim-at-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there isn’t evidence</a> that critical race theory, an academic <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal framework</a> asserting that racism is systemic and embedded in many American institutions, is being taught in classrooms across the U.S., many parents are worried that it is being taught thanks to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/critical-race-theory-thrust-spotlight-misinformation/story?id=82443791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican politicians’ and conservatives’ messaging on the topic</a>. And as that CBS/YouGov poll found, Republicans have a very negative view of critical race theory, with 86 percent viewing it unfavorably, compared with 81 percent of Democrats who viewed it favorably. Moreover, in <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/23/republicans-democrats-disagree-school-problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov poll</a> published this week, Americans were asked how concerned they were about 17 different issues facing their local schools, and Republicans said they were most concerned that students were being “indoctrinated with liberal ideas” (62 percent), while Democrats said they were most concerned about book bans (57 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the partisan differences over education in public schools, it isn’t currently a top issue for many voters in this year’s midterms. Earlier this month, the Pew Research Center asked registered voters about the importance of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/23/midterm-election-preferences-voter-engagement-views-of-campaign-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 issues</a> to their vote this fall, and while 58 percent did consider education “very important,” that result was clustered among a few others like gun policy (62 percent), voting policies (59 percent) and Supreme Court appointments (58 percent). The No. 1 issue was the economy, with 77 percent saying it was very important to their vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, education may not be the top priority that Americans expect to influence their vote this November, but it remains a controversial topic. And if the overwhelming unpopularity of book bans is any measure, the issue could still influence how voters make their decisions. </p>



<h2>Other polling bites </h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/24/744c1/3">A YouGov poll</a> conducted Aug. 24 found that over half of Americans “strongly” (37 percent) or “somewhat strongly” supported (20 percent) President Biden’s recent decision to forgive $10,000 of student loan debt for Americans earning less than $125,000. Support rose to 80 percent among Democrats, while only 35 percent of Republicans supported the decision. Opinions were also skewed heavily by age, with 30- to 44-year-old Americans voicing the most support (66 percent) and those over 65 most likely to oppose the news. </li><li>When it comes to eating out and how Americans get their groceries, concerns about the pandemic largely seem to have abated. Dining out is on the rebound, with 83 percent saying they now eat at restaurants once a month or more, compared to 87 percent in 2019 and 74 percent in 2021, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/397706/person-grocery-shopping-rebounds-online.aspx">according to a July 5-26 Gallup survey</a>. Meanwhile, almost all Americans also said they shop for groceries in person at least weekly (82 percent) or monthly (15 percent). That’s comparable to pre-pandemic data, although the coronavirus does seem to have changed at least some Americans’ grocery habits for good: Twenty-eight percent now say they now order groceries online at least once a month, up slightly from last year (23 percent) and considerably from 2019 (11 percent).</li><li>Following Kansas’s referendum on abortion earlier this month, a <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/three-in-five-americans-and-independents-are-pro-choice-following-the-recent-referendum-in-kansas/">Navigator Research poll</a> found that a clear majority (60 percent) of Americans self-identified as “pro-choice,” while only about a third identified as “pro-life.” Notably, there’s a distinct divide among racial groups, though, with a lower share of white Americans (57 percent) who were pro-abortion-rights compared to Black Americans (65 percent), Hispanic Americans (66 percent) and Asian American/Pacific Islander Americans (68 percent). And unsurprisingly, there continue to be party divides, although gender is also a significant factor among independents. Asked where they’d stand if a similar referendum took place in their own state, Democratic men (87 percent), Democratic women (85 percent) and independent women (75 percent) were far more likely to say they’d vote in favor of protecting abortion rights than independent men (48 percent), Republican women (40 percent) and Republican men (35 percent). </li><li>While <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/05/reality-tv-the-circle-netflix/">a Morning Consult analysis from last year</a> suggested reality TV is increasing in popularity, recent data from YouGov found a split in whether Americans prefer watching it or potentially starring in it. Only about a fifth said they’d be very (10 percent) or somewhat interested (11 percent) <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/19/723e1/1">in appearing on a dating reality show</a>, as opposed to 62 percent who were not interested at all. Those numbers tick up a little in the context of <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/19/723e1/2">a makeover reality show</a>: Thirty-two percent said they’d be very or somewhat interested versus 49 percent who voiced no interest at all. And <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/19/723e1/3">enthusiasm trends upward even more for home-renovation reality shows</a>, with half of Americans saying they’d be interested in participating and only 34 percent reporting no interest at all. So much for Bachelor Nation. </li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the days leading up to the Arizona Republican primary for governor, candidate Kari Lake warned that something was going very wrong. “We’re already detecting some stealing going on,” Lake <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/26/arizona-governor-candidate-kari-lake-already-claims-fraud-election-primary/10159862002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said at a campaign stop</a> the week before the election. Hours before the polls closed, <a href="https://www.wral.com/kari-lake-will-win-gop-nomination-for-arizona-governor-cnn-projects/20404186/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she hadn’t changed her tune</a>. “If we don’t win, there’s some cheating going on. And we already know that.” But when the race was over, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kari-lake-projected-winner-arizona-governor-republican-primary/story?id=87949812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake was the new</a> Republican nominee for governor in Arizona. This created a bit of a logical pickle for Lake: How did she win an election that was rigged?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We out-voted the fraud,” Lake <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/08/03/kari-lake-declares-victory-in-the-republican-governors-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said at a press conference</a> the next day, adding that her campaign had evidence of fraud that she would not detail with the media, but would give to “the authorities.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lake is not the only candidate this primary season who has had to figure out how to — or whether to — unring fraud’s bell. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-120-republicans-who-deny-the-2020-election-results-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some candidates</a> have stayed in the safe space of just saying 2020 was rigged. Others have claimed their own race as suspect. Either way, the risks are clear: Every time a candidate says the system is rigged, their supporters are more likely to become convinced the system is rigged. And victory doesn’t always end the candidate’s claims: Many keep at it, win or lose.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not only smaller races where it’s happening. It’s happening in races of all sizes,” said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and public policy institute. “Part of what’s concerning about it is how widespread this tactic has become.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By my count, at least a dozen primary candidates have lost their election and then immediately cried fraud. Tina Peters, who ran in the GOP primary for secretary of state in Colorado (and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-an-election-official-believes-the-big-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a long history</a> with election denialism), <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tina-peters-blames-election-fraud-finishing-3rd-colorado-primary-1720206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed fraud after her third-place</a> finish, saying, “We didn’t lose. We just found out more fraud.” Two candidates for the Republican primaries for Senate and governor in Michigan <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/03/ryan-kelley-4th-place-makes-dubious-claim-says-not-conceding/10222781002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made similar claims</a> after losing by wide margins. Joey Gilbert, a candidate for the Republican governor’s race in Nevada, <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/joey-gilbert-requests-statewide-recount-after-losing-gop-governor-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called for a recount</a> after losing the race to Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo by about 26,000 votes, citing “disingenuous activity” and claiming that he, in fact, won.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Georgia, Republican candidate for governor Kandiss Taylor ended up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/24/us/elections/results-georgia.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-elections-2022&amp;region=BOTTOM_NAV&amp;context=election_recirc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing the primary by 70 points</a>, coming in third with less than 4 percent of the vote behind incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp and Trump-endorsed former Sen. David Perdue. Yet Taylor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g07ItvGZGdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has refused to concede</a>. She is suspicious of the election machines used in Georgia (both ballot marking devices and tabulators), says the election was “rigged” against her and has demanded a hand recount of all of the ballots. But she also told FiveThirtyEight that she doesn’t know if a recount would change the results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I have no idea. We don’t know,” she said. “It’s not really, for me, about turning over the election. It’s more about the machines going away and us having checks and balances.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A similar sentiment has been shared by a slate of GOP primary election losers in Kentucky, <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/17/kentucky-elections-board-certifies-winners-for-ballot-in-recount-races/65400161007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six of whom have pursued recounts</a> even when losing by large margins. The candidates have not made explicit claims of fraud and instead say their goal is simply to “check the tech” and verify the results. But Michael Adams, Kentucky’s secretary of state and a Republican, said that explanation is just a cover.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They’re not telling the truth. They love moving the goalposts,” Adams said, pointing to one candidate who successfully petitioned for a recount (and raised the money to pay for it), only to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/put-end-madness-kentucky-elections-173457827.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file a new complaint</a> after the recount confirmed the original results. “They love making these reasonable-sounding arguments and then they get called on it and they show their true colors.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an interview with FiveThirtyEight, Rhonda Palazzo, one of the Kentucky candidates who sought a recount (though in a legitimately narrow race, with a difference of just 58 votes), said she wasn’t making any accusations of fraud, but also referenced the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-usa-mules/fact-check-does-2000-mules-provide-evidence-of-voter-fraud-in-the-2020-u-s-presidential-election-idUSL2N2XJ0OQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely debunked</a> conspiracy theory documentary “2000 Mules,” which claims that a network of “mules” stuffed ballot boxes around the country in 2020, using specious evidence. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But many election deniers, like Lake, are winning their elections, which presents them with more of a conundrum. When you’ve spent months complaining that the election system is rigged, what do you say when you win? For some candidates, the solution is to go mum. Doug Mastriano, the Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, had <a href="https://www.witf.org/2022/06/09/how-doug-mastriano-promoted-election-lies-between-election-day-and-january-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a long history</a> of parroting Trump’s claims of a stolen election, right up until he won his primary. When he declared victory on election night, he had nothing to say about the rigged election system. And he’s not alone — <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2022-06-16/election-deniers-quiet-on-fraud-claims-after-primary-wins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republican nominees were all too happy</a> to accept the results of their own races after spending months casting doubts on the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some raised complaints of fraud even after they had won. After Jim Marchant, the Republican nominee for secretary of state in Nevada, won his race, he said he was “not really confident in the result.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Fraud is a harsh word, but there could have been anomalies — malicious or accidental — based on what I’ve heard,” Marchant <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/conservatives-win-big-in-nevada-statewide-contests-2593169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>, but added that he still accepted his victory. “What am I supposed to do, not win?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These candidates are all singing different verses of the same song, a way to continue to sow doubt in the election system while benefiting from the support of voters who believe in such claims. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-120-republicans-who-deny-the-2020-election-results-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given the number of election deniers who have won</a> their primaries so far, it’s likely we’ll hear an encore come November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Jerrold Nadler won his Manhattan primary against fellow Rep. Carolyn Maloney in a walk on Tuesday. And in downtown Manhattan, the former federal prosecutor and lead counsel in Trump’s first impeachment inquiry, Dan Goldman, pulled out a victory in a crowded field. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Elsewhere in the state, Democrats overperformed in two special elections, including a win in New York’s 19th District, which is 4 percentage points more Republican than the nation, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses what these results mean for the midterms this fall and where other indicators of the political environment are pointing.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In your <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typical midterm election</a> with an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular Democratic president</a>, you’d expect Republicans to be flying high. But the evidence is mounting that the national political environment right now actually leans toward <em>Democrats</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, Democrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro in a special election for New York’s swingy 19th Congressional District by 2 percentage points, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=88696554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51 percent to 49 percent</a>.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> At the same time, Republican Joe Sempolinski defeated Democrat Max Della Pia by a closer-than-expected margin of 7 points in the special election for New York’s solid-red 23rd District. On their own, these elections could be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismissed as flukes</a>, chalked up to local factors or particularly strong or weak candidates. But given how these two elections are part of a larger pattern of good results for Democrats over the last two months, they suddenly look a lot more like signal than noise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We at FiveThirtyEight often track the results of special elections (i.e., elections that occur at unusual times because an office unexpectedly becomes vacant) because of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints they provide to the national mood</a>. When a party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently does well in special elections</a> — defined not by winning or losing, but by outperforming a state or district’s baseline partisanship — it’s often a sign that the national political environment favors that party, and is therefore a <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/1/9/1698453/-Special-elections-are-correlated-with-House-election-results-and-that-s-good-news-for-Democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good omen for that party</a> in the upcoming regular general election.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/key-issues-abortion-rights-affect-primaries-ahead-midterms-88747544</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Up until mid-June, special elections for the U.S. House during the Biden presidency were pointing to a national political environment that was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-special-elections-so-far-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutral or a little bit Republican-leaning</a>. On average, Republicans did 2 points better in those elections than you’d expect based on the districts’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan leans</a>.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> That all changed, though, starting in late June — immediately after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-overturns-roe-wade-landmark-case-abortion/story?id=85160781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturning the constitutional right to abortion</a>. There have been four first-past-the-post special House elections since that decision, and Democrats have outperformed their expected margins in those elections by an average of 9 points.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">(There is one data point missing from this analysis, however: the <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/02/08/alaska-ranked-choice-voting-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice</a> special election in Alaska’s at-large district. Currently, Republicans have <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SSPG/ElectionSummaryReportRPTS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 percentage points</a> more first-place votes than Democrats in that race, despite Alaska’s R+15 partisan lean. But it’s not clear how meaningful that is, given the <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/08/11/why-republicans-in-alaskas-first-ranked-choice-election-reserve-their-venom-for-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusual dynamics</a> at play in a ranked-choice election. In fact, when the ranked-choice votes are tabulated on Aug. 31, it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1562305696200380418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite possible</a> that the Democratic candidate will receive more votes than the last Republican standing — which would be an even <em>bigger</em> upset than Ryan’s win. We’ll just have to wait and see.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The pattern of Democratic overperformance started with the June 28 special election in Nebraska’s 1st District. No one expected this district with an R+17 partisan lean to be competitive, but it was a nailbiter: Republicans won by <a href="https://electionresults.nebraska.gov/resultsSW.aspx?text=Race&amp;type=CG&amp;map=DIST" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 5 points</a>. Then, on Aug. 9, Democrats came even closer (<a href="https://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/20220809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within 4 points</a>) in a similarly red district, Minnesota’s 1st (partisan lean R+15). This was still just two data points, though. But then, of course, came Tuesday’s special elections in New York. In the 19th District, Democrats’ winning margin was 6 points better than the district’s R+4 partisan lean, and in the 23rd District, it was 9 points better. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bottom line is these two data points put to rest any notion that the Nebraska and Minnesota results were a fluke; special-election results are clearly indicating that the political winds are now at Democrats’ backs. And it’s not just special-election results. Democrats and their allies have also done well in other, non-special elections since Dobbs. The results of Washington’s top-two primaries (which, unusually, pit Democrats and Republicans against each other and have historically done a good job predicting the November elections) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/16/democrats-midterms-hopes-washington-00052049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were not consistent with past “red wave” midterm elections</a>. And a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-vote-in-kansas-looks-like-its-going-to-be-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas ballot measure</a> that would have clarified that the state constitution does <em>not</em> protect abortion rights <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article264681054.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed by a large, 18-point margin</a> despite the state’s conservative leanings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, one of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best indicators</a> we have of the national environment in a midterm year has also gotten better for Democrats since Dobbs — although it is currently showing more of a neutral political environment than a Democratic-leaning one. On the day of the Dobbs decision, Republicans led polls of the generic congressional ballot, or polls that ask Americans which party they plan to support for Congress, by 2.3 points, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s average</a>. But since then, Democrats have gained 2.7 points, and on Wednesday,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 11:45 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> they hold a small lead in these polls.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="920" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/generic-ballot-2-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This is unusual, given that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-midterm-chances-dont-hinge-on-bidens-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls usually get <em>worse</em></a>, not better, for the president’s party as a midterm election draws closer. That could be a sign that 2022 could be the rare midterm that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-this-be-an-asterisk-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bucks the usual trend</a> of the president’s party getting a “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/11/03/131046118/obama-humbled-by-election-shellacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shellacking</a>.” And if so, Democrats may have the Supreme Court to thank. Correlation isn’t causation, but given the precise timing (Republicans overperformed in special elections on June 7 and June 14, then Democrats started their hot streak on June 28), it seems quite likely that the Dobbs decision is responsible for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shift in the political environment</a>. In other words, it could be akin to other major news events that turned midterm elections on their heads: former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998, and the Sept. 11 attacks and subsequent war on terror in 2002. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also worth noting there has been other good news for Democrats in recent weeks: They <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/16/biden-inflation-reduction-act-signing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, a major climate, health-care and tax bill. Gas prices have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/energy/gas-prices-inflation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly declined</a>, potentially weakening the potency of Republican attacks on inflation. And President Biden’s approval rating has slowly been <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticking back up</a>. All these things could have contributed to Democrats’ special-election success too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But none of this is a guarantee of Democratic success in the midterms. As quickly as those developments broke, others — perhaps better for Republicans — can replace them. The polls could still move away from Democrats, in keeping with historical precedent. Of course, events thus far have suggested we aren’t in a typical midterm situation; for instance, maybe the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch from registered-voter polls to likely-voter polls</a> won’t benefit Republicans as much as expected because <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/nbc-news-poll-57-voters-say-investigations-trump-continue-rcna43989" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are so fired up</a>. But there are still two and a half months until Election Day. And while it’s hard to deny that Democrats have the momentum right now, it’s an open question of whether they can sustain it.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What happens when redistricting produces big changes in the third- and fourth-most populous states in the country? You get a bunch of fascinating primaries. Florida and New York have a huge number on tap today, along with a couple primary runoffs of interest in Oklahoma. My colleague Nathaniel Rakich covered <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-is-holding-another-primary-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Empire State’s multitude of high-profile races yesterday</a>, so now we’ll run through the 11 primaries to watch in Florida and two runoffs in Oklahoma.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<h2><strong>Florida</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 20th, 23rd and 27th congressional districts; governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the top of the ballot, Florida Democrats must pick their nominee in the race for <strong>governor</strong> against Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, and there are two key contenders in that race: Rep. Charlie Crist, a <a href="https://www.nga.org/governor/charlie-crist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former <em>Republican </em>governor</a> and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2014&amp;fips=12&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee</a>, and Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, whose <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/11/18/this-is-how-nikki-fried-won-the-only-statewide-office-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow 2018 win</a> marks the only statewide victory by a Florida Democrat since 2012.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most polls since June have put Crist ahead, including a poll released Monday from <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/549748-final-poll-charlie-crist-headed-to-victory-in-florida-democratic-primary-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Pete Polls/FloridaPolitics.com</a> that found him leading 59 percent to 30 percent, which echoed findings <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/544017-poll-charlie-crist-maintains-dominating-lead-in-democratic-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from earlier this month</a>. And <a href="https://charliecrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/August-2022-Florida-Primary-Change-Research.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent polls</a> conducted <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/548125-charlie-crist-releases-another-internal-showing-dominating-primary-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on behalf</a> of Crist’s campaign have shown him ahead as well, as did Fried’s latest poll, a <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinCate/status/1557353944153833473?s=20&amp;t=DBJ-ay5-9XKEdENFpJc6Ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling survey</a> conducted two weeks ago that found Crist ahead 42 percent to 35 percent. In something of an outlier, however, another recent poll from the University of North Florida <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/587232872/UNF-PORL-August-Survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found Fried narrowly ahead</a>, 47 percent to 43 percent, so she can’t be written off.</p>

She has <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiFried/status/1541873276833697797?s=20&amp;t=kzWS8TOJcS7N_xi63UUaEw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed Crist opposes abortion rights</a>, and her political action committee <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1555006708187111429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has run ads criticizing</a> Crist for appointing an anti-abortion state Supreme Court justice during his tenure as governor. Fried has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/charlie-crist-nikki-fried-blast-airwaves-rcna42904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also attacked Crist</a> for <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article2290614.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his work as a state legislator</a> in the 1990s to pass mandatory minimums for prison time, an issue that has <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/141027_iachr_racial_disparities_aclu_submission_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately affected communities of color</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Crist has shot back, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/E6gpRuYA5vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with ads highlighting</a> his 2010 veto of Republican-backed legislation to restrict abortion rights and his high ratings from pro-abortion rights organizations. He’s also <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/99fe0fce-3c92-460c-be55-efa9080c1031/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit Fried for her past support</a> of some GOP politicians and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/547942-nikki-fried-again-answers-for-matt-gaetz-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for her association</a> with Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, who is under investigation for violating sex trafficking laws. Crist <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/08/18/the-wave-of-television-ads-ahead-of-florida-primary-00052579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has had the financial upper hand</a>, too, as he and his PAC have spent about twice as much on ads as Fried, $4.9 million to $2.4 million. He’s also <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/535311-one-of-floridas-biggest-unions-backs-charlie-crist-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received backing from major labor groups</a> such as the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But whoever advances out of the Democratic primary will face an uphill fight against DeSantis in November. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a> gives the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republican-rally-ron-desantis-kari-lake-blake-masters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored 2024 presidential contender</a> about a 9 in 10 chance of winning, aided by <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/08/15/frieds-contends-environment-group-paid-for-reporters-writing-about-her-00051769" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the eye-popping</a> $135 million or so in his campaign account, a figure that dwarfs the war chests of Crist and Fried.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As for Florida’s high-profile congressional primaries, most are taking place in seats that are relatively safe for one party, as 25 of the state’s 28 districts are rated “solid Democratic” or “solid Republican,” according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our election forecast</a>. In fact, there’s only one must-watch House primary that involves the underdog party, and that’s in the <strong>27th District</strong>, which on paper <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is the most competitive seat in Florida</a> with a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+1.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> Democrats face an uphill battle against first-term Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar, who is Cuban American, in this heavily Latino district in Miami, but state Sen. Annette Taddeo and Miami City Commissioner Ken Russell are fighting for the Democratic nomination <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/542685-survey-finds-annette-taddeo-within-striking-distance-of-maria-elvira-salazar-in-cd-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the hopes</a> of <a href="https://www.termlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/USTL-FL27-Toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">springing an upset</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The other notable South Florida primary is in the deep blue <strong>20th District</strong>, a plurality-Black seat represented by Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick.

<p data-paragraph="main">Shifting our sights to central Florida, the GOP primary will probably pick the next representative from the Tampa Bay-area <strong>13th District</strong>, a seat that Crist left behind to run for governor and that shifted from R+1 to R+12 in redistricting.

<p data-paragraph="main">Nearby, the newly-drawn <strong>15th District</strong> east of Tampa is an R+7 seat that could be competitive in November, but its crowded GOP primary will probably pick the district’s next representative. It’s not clear whom Republicans will back, but former Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, state Sen. Kelli Stargel and state Rep. Jackie Toledo have emerged as the front-runners. We have a handful of independent polls of this primary, but they differ quite a bit. An early July poll <a href="https://sunshinesummit.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Florida-Battleground-CD-Brushfires_7-13-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by the Tyson Group</a> found Stargel at 13 percent, followed by Lee and Toledo at 10 percent, and was used to <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/07/14/new-gop-poll-shows-whos-ahead-in-crowded-primaries-00045758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set a qualification threshold</a> for debates. But more recent surveys <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/543393-poll-laurel-lee-opens-up-massive-lead-in-cd-15-gop-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early August</a> and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/549339-poll-majority-of-gop-voters-who-already-cast-cd-15-ballots-support-laurel-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just before the primary</a> by St. Pete Polls/FloridaPolitics.com found Lee in the mid-to-high 40s, well ahead of Stargel at around 20 percent and Toledo, who dropped into the single-digits in the later poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lee’s lead could be down to her financial edge, especially her aid from outside groups. She <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL15241/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> $663,000 on her own, but the Conservative Action Fund and Americans for Prosperity <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=FL15&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have spent</a> $1.4 million on her behalf. Stargel <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL15233/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t raised as much</a> — $348,000 ($100,000 from her own pocket) — but Conservative Warriors PAC has spent $946,000 supporting her or opposing Lee or Toledo. This has <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/08/11/floridas-smooth-2020-election-gets-bashed-in-gop-primary-00051038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included ads</a> portraying Lee <a href="https://youtu.be/Eujxft-_AMc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as weak on election security</a> because she didn’t support an audit of Florida’s 2020 results (note that Trump <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=12&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won Florida by 3 points</a>). But Lee and her allies <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2022/08/01/how-republican-candidates-are-using-desantis-00048860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried to portray her as close to DeSantis</a>, who is popular with Republicans, by <a href="https://vimeo.com/735265695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running ads</a> arguing that she was DeSantis’s pick “to safeguard our elections,” a clear play to GOP primary voters’ Trump-inspired concerns about election security. Toledo is also in the mix, having raised $559,000, but she hasn’t gotten much outside backing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another former swing seat that redistricting shifted heavily to the right is the <strong>7th District</strong> north of Orlando, which went from D+5 to R+14.

<p data-paragraph="main">West of Orlando, the GOP primary for the R+19 <strong>11th District</strong> features a contest between Rep. Daniel Webster and far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has called herself a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/19/21375159/laura-loomer-congress-republican-florida-trump-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proud Islamophobe</a>” and has been banned by multiple social-media platforms. As an incumbent, Webster is favored, but we can’t rule out Loomer surprising him. After all, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/11/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’s outraised</a> Webster $763,000 to $595,000, and voters aren’t necessarily that familiar with him as Webster currently represents only about one-third of this district following redistricting. Still, Webster did enter the home stretch of the campaign with more than three times as much money as Loomer, $378,000 to $112,000. Loomer has tried to portray Webster, who is 73, as too old to be in Congress, but that’s a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/laura-loomer-attacks-opponent-for-his-age-in-famously-elderly-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questionable line of attack</a> in a district that includes <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/opinions/mark-meadows-the-villages-florida-nostalgia-trump-hemmer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Villages</a>, a huge and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very Republican-leaning</a> retirement community.</p>

Gray, a <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/441464-democrat-terence-gray-announces-candidacy-in-cd-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-known figure</a> in Orlando’s Black community, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL10226/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> just $317,000, while Brown’s comeback campaign — she represented a predominantly Black district that included part of Orlando <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/7695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 1993 to 2017</a> — seems doomed. <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL10358/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She’s raised</a> just $90,000, and <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2022/05/18/former-rep-corrine-brown-will-continue-to-get-her-pension-after-guilty-plea-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she pleaded guilty in May</a> to a felony charge of obstructing internal revenue laws for a charity she ran. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Florida’s panhandle, Gaetz faces meaningful opposition in the deep-red <strong>1st District</strong>’s GOP primary in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/27/sex-trafficking-allegations-matt-gaetz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the wake of an ongoing federal investigation</a> into whether he engaged in sexual activities with a 17-year old girl and paid for women to cross state lines to have sex. Former FedEx executive Mark Lombardo has tried to use the scandal against Gaetz, running ads tying Gaetz’s investigation <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/31/facebook-posts/yes-matt-gaetz-was-lone-no-vote-human-trafficking-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to his lone dissenting vote</a> on a 2017 human trafficking bill signed into law by Trump. Lombardo has also <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matt-gaetz-fbi-informant-campaign-ad_n_62fdad64e4b0a85a819884df" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made unsubstantiated claims</a> that <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matt-gaetz-fbi-informant-campaign-ad_n_62fdad64e4b0a85a819884df" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaetz was an informant against Trump</a> who tipped off the FBI to classified documents that it recently seized at Mar-a-Lago. It’s difficult to know just how much trouble Gaetz is in, though, as we have no polling to rely on. Moreover, Gaetz <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintains a huge financial edge</a> over Lombardo: The incumbent had spent $6.5 million as of Aug. 3 to Lombardo’s $515,000, and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL01282/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of Lombardo’s money is self-funded</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, redistricting in northern Florida did away with the plurality-Black district running from Tallahassee to Jacksonville, and the new R+15 <strong>4th</strong> <strong>District</strong> will almost certainly elect a Republican in the fall. The GOP primary has developed into a two-man race between state Senate President Pro Tempore Aaron Bean and Navy veteran Erick Aguilar. Bean looks favored, though, based on the little polling we’ve seen. An early August survey from <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/544424-poll-aaron-bean-in-dominating-position-ahead-of-cd-4-gop-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Pete Polls/FloridaPolitics.com</a> found Bean well ahead with 59 percent to Aguilar’s 16 percent. Bean also enjoys endorsements from heavy hitters such as Rubio. And while DeSantis has not endorsed here, <a href="https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2022/07/14/florida-republican-aguilar-trump-00045643" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s been an ally of Bean</a>, too. Still, Aguilar <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/FL/04/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised</a> Bean, $1.3 million to $511,000, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0FL04140/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks in part to</a> $450,000 in self-funding, so he can’t be written off. However, Bean <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=FL04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has received</a> $1.3 million in outside support to offset Aguilar’s edge while Aguilar has earned no outside backing.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 2nd Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the aftermath of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/21-republican-primaries-and-a-special-election-to-watch-on-june-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its June 28 primary</a>, the Sooner State has two notable GOP runoffs. Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin and former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon will meet in a runoff in the special election for <strong>Senate</strong> to succeed Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, <a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/oklahoma-sen-jim-inhofe-to-announce-resignation-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who announced</a> earlier this year that he would resign at the end of the current Congress. Mullin looks like the favorite. He handily led in the <a href="https://results.okelections.us/OKER/?elecDate=20220628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first round of voting</a> with about 44 percent of the vote, while Shannon had around 18 percent in the 13-candidate primary field. Moreover, Trump <a href="https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-donald-trump-endorses-markwayne-mullin/40573070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has since endorsed Mullin</a>, and polls and money give Mullin an edge, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most polls have Mullin sitting right near the 50 percent mark, but the extent of Mullin’s lead has varied. A <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/630018f943e12207204b0ef4/poll:-race-for-gop-senate-nomination-tightens-in-oklahoma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll released on</a> Friday by SoonerPoll/News 9/News On 6 gave Mullin a 10-point edge, 49 percent to 39 percent, which was closer than Mullin’s 49 percent to 31 percent advantage in a poll conducted a couple of days earlier by <a href="https://www.amberintegrated.com/news/amber-integrated-releases-survey-of-likely-gop-run-off-election-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amber Integrated</a>. But <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00498345/1623196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mullin has</a> also <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00808360/1623359/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily outspent Shannon</a> since the primary, $634,000 to $92,000 as of Aug. 3. Shannon has struggled to outflank Mullin on the right, as their lone debate showed they <a href="https://www.newson6.com/story/62e9ac551e8392072d656c4d/mullin-shannon-talk-issues-in-prerunoff-senatorial-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely agree on most issues</a>, including support for abortion bans and Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was rigged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, a huge list of candidates jumped into the GOP primary to succeed Mullin in the dark-red <strong>2nd District</strong> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/oklahoma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in eastern Oklahoma</a>, and the outcome was much closer as state Rep. Avery Frix and former state Sen. Josh Brecheen <a href="https://results.okelections.us/OKER/?elecDate=20220628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced to a runoff with only</a> 15 and 14 percent of the vote, respectively. It looks like the runoff is going to be extremely competitive, too, as two surveys, one released in <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/62e9a49d4213e7071f5d09bf/poll:-oklahomas-cd2-gop-race-still-neckandneck-between-brecheen-frix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early August</a> and one <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/63001d8a963ad107263bc2c9/congressional-race-between-frix-brecheen-a-nailbiter-poll-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just before the primary</a> by SoonerPoll/News 9/News On 6, found the two running close together. Frix led by 6 points in the most recent poll, but 42 percent of primary voters were still undecided, which could make for an unpredictable outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both candidates <a href="https://www.newson6.com/story/62f193ca856a4607267a8a61/district-2-race-heats-up-over-dark-money-funded-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have played up</a> their pro-Trump positions, yet <a href="https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/super-pacs-are-spending-big-on-gop-candidates-in-oklahomas-open-u-s-house-and-senate-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending by outside groups</a> questioning those conservative bona fides has turned this into an expensive contest. The pro-Brecheen School Freedom Fund (<a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/about/schoolfreedomfund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed by the Club for Growth</a>) has spent $1.8 million <a href="https://twitter.com/reesejgorman/status/1552745059312979969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on mail pieces</a> and TV ads that have claimed Frix supported tax hikes as a state legislator. But the pro-Frix Fund for a Working Congress has countered with $1.3 million in ads, which have claimed that Brecheen wants to do away with the Electoral College or that if Brecheen “had his way Hillary Clinton would be President.” This outside influx in spending has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/OK/02/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far outpaced candidate spending</a> in what looks to be anyone’s race.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In late April, New York was all set to hold its primary election as scheduled on June 28 when word came down from the New York Court of Appeals: The state’s Democratic-drawn congressional map was an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unconstitutional partisan gerrymander</a> and would have to be redrawn. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The move threw both the calendar and campaigns into chaos. The need for more time to draw a new map led to the <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/news/2022/04/29/ny-s-congressional--state-primaries-to-be-held-aug--23--judge-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postponement of New York’s primaries</a> for Congress<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the state Senate, whose map was also thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> to Aug. 23 — this Tuesday. And the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/court_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new map</a> has radically changed the configuration of several districts, separating many incumbents from their geographic base and setting off a game of electoral musical chairs. As a result, at least one incumbent, and possibly as many as five, will lose their primaries.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, there’s the usual menagerie of competitive primaries for rare open seats, plus two special elections that will continue to shed light on whether the national political environment has shifted toward Democrats in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson. So without further ado, here are all the races you should be watching in New York this week.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reason we know at least one incumbent will lose their primary? Two of them are running against each other in the Democratic primary for New York’s <strong>12th District</strong>. Rep. Jerrold Nadler has represented the Upper West Side of Manhattan for 30 years, while Rep. Carolyn Maloney has represented the Upper East Side for virtually the same amount of time.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were first elected in 1992, but because Nadler’s district was vacant at the time, he was sworn in two months before Maloney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> But this year, the two neighborhoods were (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/21/only-new-york-upper-west-sides-nadler-taking-upper-east-sides-maloney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite controversially</a>) drawn into the same seat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On paper, Maloney should be the favorite: She has outraised Nadler <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY14037/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.0 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY17071/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.9 million</a>, and 61 percent of the new district’s residents were also in her old district (the remaining 39 percent were in Nadler’s). However, not everyone in Maloney’s old district loves her; in 2020, she barely survived a primary challenge from attorney Suraj Patel. Though redistricting removed the most pro-Patel parts of Maloney’s old district (Queens and Brooklyn), Maloney defeated Patel only 50 percent to 37 percent in the Manhattan portion of the district in 2020. And much to Maloney’s chagrin, Patel is running here again in 2022, and he’s raised a serious amount of money too (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NY12129/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ideology hasn’t been a major dividing line in the race, though. All three candidates support liberal policies, and both Nadler and Maloney have snagged major progressive endorsements: <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1536695096632037376?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Elizabeth Warren</a> and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/01/jerry-nadler-gets-working-families-party-endorsement-over-carolyn-maloney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Families Party</a> for Nadler, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-election-2022-rep-carolyn-maloney-gloria-steinem-endorsement-20220126-xvffiqpepfaafigofd6sy2zltm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gloria Steinem</a> for Maloney. Instead, they’ve been campaigning more on identity. In a district with a significant Jewish population, Nadler has emphasized that he is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/nyregion/jewish-congress-nadler-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last Jewish person representing New York City in the House</a>. Maloney, who shattered multiple glass ceilings early in her career, has argued that the Dobbs decision has made it especially important to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/nyregion/carolyn-maloney-women-nadler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send a woman to Congress</a>. And the 38-year-old Patel is running against the two septuagenarians on an implicit message of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/nyregion/suraj-patel-nadler-maloney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generational change</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the campaign’s closing days, Nadler has started to break out of the pack. In early August, Maloney had to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/carolyn-maloney-apologizes-to-joe-biden-for-saying-he-won-t-run-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apologize</a> after her opponents <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/08/03/maloney-attempts-to-clean-up-comments-about-biden-s-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pounced on her</a> for a debate answer in which she said she didn’t think President Biden would run for reelection. Nadler also picked up two potentially meaningful endorsements: one from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/opinion/new-york-congress-jerrold-nadler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, the other from <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/08/15/schumer-endorses-nadler-over-maloney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer</a>. The <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/new-york-district-12-poll-nadler-extends-lead-over-maloney-and-patel-in-ny-12-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent polling</a> (fielded Aug. 12-17 by Emerson College) now gives Nadler 43 percent support, Maloney 24 percent and Patel 14 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting could also cost Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones his seat — but, in a twist, because he tried to <em>avoid</em> a member-versus-member primary. When New York’s new congressional map was finalized, Jones’s neighbor, Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (no relation to Carolyn), got drawn out of his 18th District into Jones’s 17th District. Despite the fact that 74 percent of Maloney’s constituents remained in the 18th, Maloney quickly announced he would run for reelection in the (bluer) 17th — <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/us-elections-government/ny-mondaire-jones-sean-patrick-maloney-democratic-redistricting-20220517-rzoghopsmrbclglt2tkdaybeju-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without, Jones said, giving him a heads-up</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That left Jones, a progressive rising star and one of the two <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/03/mondaire-jones-congress-house-of-representatives/4112104001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first openly gay Black members of Congress</a>, with only bad choices about where to run for reelection. Ultimately, he made the surprising decision to move <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1527872550696628224?s=20&amp;t=TCZRffNPPuWFa1GakKLanw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an hour’s drive south</a> and run in the deep-blue <strong>10th District</strong> in the heart of New York City — a seat with zero overlap with his political base.</p>

For instance, state Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou has eaten into Jones’s progressive support, sporting <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/08/endorsements-new-yorks-10th-congressional-district/374474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> from the Working Families Party and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. New York City Council member Carlina Rivera is also running with the support of <a href="https://www.amny.com/politics/speaker-adrienne-adams-endorses-carlina-rivera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influential local leaders</a>, one of the state’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/07/05/seiu-1199-backs-carlina-rivera-in-crowded-dem-primary-ny-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful unions</a> and several Hispanic groups, one of which is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/18/latino-pac-drops-500-000-in-last-minute-ad-buy-for-new-york-congressional-candidate-00052438" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending $500,000</a> on her behalf. Meanwhile, former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, who at the time of her election in 1972 was the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Oral-History/Women/Representative-Holtzman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youngest woman</a> ever elected to Congress,<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That distinction is &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/2018/11/07/pardee-school-alumna-youngest-woman-ever-elected-to-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;now held&lt;/a&gt; by fellow New Yorker Rep.

&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>23</sup></a> is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/23/nyregion/liz-holtzman-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking a comeback</a> after 42 years away from Washington. State Assembly member Jo Anne Simon could also be boosted by the fact that she’s the only candidate who currently holds office on the Brooklyn side of the district. And even former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio briefly ran for the seat, although he <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasio-drops-out-of-crowded-congressional-race-citing-low-poll-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out</a> in July due to lack of support.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, the home stretch of the campaign has been defined by yet another candidate: former federal prosecutor Daniel Goldman, who served as the lead Democratic counsel for then-President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial. Goldman has already used his personal wealth (he is an heir to the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/21/denim-dynasty-cash-among-ny-10-contributions-flowing-from-outside-the-district-00046920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Levi Strauss jeans fortune</a>) to raise <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY10308/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.4 million</a> for his campaign in the span of just two months (Jones, at <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY17174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.6 million</a>, was the only other candidate to raise more than $640,000). And after spending at least <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/11/goldman-fcc-ny-10-00050938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.8 million</a> on TV ads, Goldman appears to have jumped out to a small lead: An <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/new-york-district-10-primary-poll-goldman-leads-pack-while-niou-rivera-and-jones-remain-top-tier-contenders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College poll</a> conducted Aug. 10-13 put Goldman at 22 percent support, Niou at 17 percent, Jones at 13 percent, Rivera at 13 percent, Simon at 6 percent and Holtzman at 4 percent. On Aug. 13, Goldman also snagged the coveted endorsement of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/opinion/new-york-congress-dan-goldman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, likely tipping even more voters in his direction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in the <strong>17th District</strong>, though, Sean Patrick Maloney may not get off scot-free. Many progressives resented Maloney’s strong-arming of Jones, and one of them, state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/nyregion/biaggi-sean-patrick-maloney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to run against him</a>. Biaggi has experience unseating powerful incumbents — in 2018, she defeated a former leader of the Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of Democratic state senators who formed a governing coalition with Republicans — and progressives like the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/13/wfp-to-drop-maloney-endorsement-and-back-biaggi-00039040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Families Party</a> and <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2022/06/07/aoc-endorses-biaggi-in-primary-against-dccc-chair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep.

Santiago / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Maloney <a href="https://hvmag.com/archive/congressman-sean-patrick-maloney-mr-pragmatic-goes-back-to-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started his House career</a> as a moderate, but he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/us/politics/ocasio-cortez-maloney-new-york-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounded more liberal lately</a>. He is, however, an establishment Democrat through and through: He chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and former President Bill Clinton (who lives in the newly drawn district) has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/nyregion/maloney-clinton-endorsement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him</a>. Those connections have helped Maloney handily outraise Biaggi, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY22139/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.0 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03196/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$807,000</a>. Additionally, any disadvantage Maloney has from representing only 25 percent of the new district’s residents is nullified by the fact that Biaggi’s Senate district does not overlap at all with the new 17th. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, then, both campaigns released <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-369c-d60a-a1fe-76bcde140000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-369e-d7d7-a3c2-f69e2c270000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> in July giving Maloney the lead — though of course, they disagreed on its size. Averaging the two gives Maloney 43 percent and Biaggi 20 percent; however, 38 percent of voters were still undecided. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given his access to money and his more moderate reputation, Maloney would likely be Democrats’ stronger candidate here in the fall. And with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> of D+7, this district <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be vulnerable</a> in a pro-Republican midterm environment. For their part, the GOP has a five-way primary for the seat, with state Assembly member Michael Lawler the apparent front-runner. He has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY17162/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$519,000</a>, more than twice the (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY16099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly self-funded</a>) total of his closest opponent, Somers Council member William Faulkner.</p>

Jamaal Bowman is the latest member of the progressive “Squad” to face a nontrivial primary challenge from their right. <p>Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The final incumbent in potential danger on Tuesday is Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman in New York’s <strong>16th District</strong>. A member of “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Squad</a>,” a group of progressive lawmakers of color, Bowman successfully primaried then-Rep. Eliot Engel from the left two years ago. But as such, Bowman still has enemies within the party, and he faces two nontrivial challengers: Westchester County legislators Vedat Gashi and Catherine Parker. Gashi boasts <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/08/vedat-gashi-eliot-engel-jamaal-bowman-congress-primary-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engel’s endorsement</a> and has outraised Parker <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY16081/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$838,000</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY17281/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$374,000</a>, so he looks like the more serious threat to Bowman. However, the split in the anti-progressive vote will likely redound to the incumbent’s already-considerable advantage. His <a href="https://bowmanforcongress.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> run the gamut from Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Sen. Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, and he has raised more money (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY16143/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.6 million</a>) than Gashi and Parker combined.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next up are the several districts whose incumbents simply aren’t running for reelection, opening the door to primary scrums. Take the <strong>1st District</strong>, a Long Island seat from which Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin is retiring to run for governor. The Suffolk County Republican Party’s executive committee <a href="https://riverheadlocal.com/2022/02/22/in-race-to-succeed-zeldin-in-ny-01-as-democrats-gear-up-for-primary-county-republican-leadership-unites-behind-one-candidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously endorsed</a> Nick LaLota, the chief of staff of the county legislature, in the Republican primary back in February, but then cryptocurrency trader Michelle Bond jumped into the race in May. Since then, Bond has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY01257/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> (including more than $800,000 of her own money), more than twice LaLota’s total (almost <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY01190/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$485,000</a>). Super PACs — including a pro-cryptocurrency group <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/160714/crypto-booster-michelle-bond-is-running-for-congress-with-help-from-her-ftx-exec-boyfriend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded by Bond’s boyfriend</a>! — have also spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NY01&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> to help Bond win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The campaign has <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-nick-lalota-michelle-bond-1st-congressional-district-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devolved into a series of attacks</a> over both candidates’ past work for Democrats and weak ties to the district (LaLota lives outside its boundaries; Bond just moved there this year). But while both candidates have tied themselves to Trump, the extreme pro-Trump group <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-long-island-loud-majority-kevin-smith-shawn-farash-cait-corrigan-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long Island Loud Majority</a> is in Bond’s corner. That may prove damaging, however, if she advances to the general election against presumptive Democratic nominee Bridget Fleming, given that this R+5 seat is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to be competitive this year</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A similar battle between Trumpy and Trumpier is unfolding in another open Republican primary on the opposite end of the state: in the <strong>23rd District</strong>, outside Buffalo. New York GOP Chair Nick Langworthy and real-estate developer Carl Paladino <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/nyregion/carl-paladino-langworthy-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to be political allies</a>, but now they are competing against each other for the right to succeed Rep. Chris Jacobs in this safe-red (R+23) seat. And the primary has gotten <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/12/paladino-langworthy-trade-blows-as-bitter-upstate-ny-gop-house-race-gets-nastier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nasty</a>, with the candidates throwing around epithets like “Cowardly Carl” and “Lying Langworthy.”</p>

(The former president has not weighed in.) But in many ways, Paladino is the OG Trump: He ran a grievance-fueled campaign for governor in 2010 in which he made <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/the-highlights-and-lowlights-of-carl-paladinos-political-career/article_2fccf2e4-6eb4-5840-8b87-90d2a3088a2b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexist and homophobic comments</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SisVSg9jov8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened reporters</a>; in 2017, he was <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/7day-state/article/Report-Carl-Paladino-removed-from-Buffalo-school-11859264.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed from the Buffalo school board</a> after making <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/outrage-and-calls-for-paladino-to-resign-grow-over-obama-comments/article_35135d61-0032-59c4-b759-7e6276836750.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist comments about Michelle Obama</a>. And in this campaign, he has the support of pro-Trump House members like <a href="https://twitter.com/jessemckinley/status/1549052639337336833?s=20&amp;t=PhrrflHYzKj6HSd5-3AdlQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reps. Elise Stefanik and Matt Gaetz</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Paladino has also outraised Langworthy <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY23202/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY23228/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$370,000</a>, but almost all of Paladino’s haul came from his own bank account, while almost all of Langworthy’s is from individual donors, generally a better sign of public support. A pro-Langworthy super PAC has also helped close the spending gap with <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NY23&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> in spending.

A note of caution, though: While the poll itself was not sponsored by any interest group, the person who spearheaded the poll, Barry Zeplowitz, has given money to Langworthy’s campaign and worked for Langworthy previously.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the seat that Republican Rep. John Katko is retiring from — the new <strong>22nd District</strong> — leans Democratic by 2 percentage points, so the GOP primary to replace him has seen a lot less red meat. Former New York GOP Treasurer Steve Wells is the front-runner there, and he has <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/07/cny-race-for-congress-steve-wells-ducks-trump-talk-while-opponent-embraces-ex-prez.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoided talking about Trump</a> on the stump — sometimes to the frustration of voters. That may leave an opening for Navy veteran Brandon Williams, who has embraced the former president (but not his lies that the 2020 election was stolen). Wells has outraised Williams <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY22238/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$691,000</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY22212/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$214,000</a>, but the race appears close enough that the cavalry has intervened: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House GOP leadership, swooped in last week with an almost <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/08/national-gop-group-boosts-steve-wells-with-300k-ad-blitz-as-his-campaign-donations-drop-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300,000 TV-ad buy</a> to help Wells lock down the nomination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Either Wells or Williams will be in for a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tough race this fall</a> against whoever emerges from the Democratic primary here. Four Democrats are in the running, but the clear front-runner is Navy reservist Francis Conole, who has outraised his nearest opponent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY24063/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY24150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$133,000</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have a couple open seats of their own. Rep. Tom Suozzi left the <strong>3rd District</strong> behind to run (unsuccessfully) for governor, and the Democratic primary to replace him sports four serious candidates. The <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-election-2022-tom-suozzi-new-york-governor-campaign-20220613-chn534pnyrgcbc5y2hmcowv2nq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centrist Suozzi</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/JCColtin/status/1546483878117900294?s=20&amp;t=i_AZ9Y-uC7nQPw3LKTANbA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> Nassau County Legislator Josh Lafazan, who is also Democrats’ top fundraiser in this race, with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03162/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.6 million</a>. Lafazan has said he, like Suozzi, would join the bipartisan <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshLafazan/status/1557071069223305224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problem Solvers Caucus</a> in Congress, but his opponents have <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/3rd-congressional-district-democratic-primary-kaiman-zimmerman-lafazan-darrigo-rasool-p3tp6wgu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked him for being <em>too</em> bipartisan</a>, having once accepted the endorsement of the Conservative Party of New York and supported making police officers a protected class.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hoping to capitalize is Democratic National Committee member Robert Zimmerman, who is close behind with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03188/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million raised</a>. Zimmerman, with <a href="https://zimmermanforcongress.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsements</a> from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several current and past members of the New York congressional delegation, is the clear establishment pick and has <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/07/one-most-competitive-long-island-primaries-recent-memory-five-candidates-vie-replace-tom-suozzi/375103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more liberal views</a>. However, the race’s true progressive is community organizer Melanie D’Arrigo, who attempted to primary Suozzi in 2020 and, this time, boasts endorsements from <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a> and <a href="https://indivisible.org/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indivisible</a>. However, she has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NY03075/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $392,000</a>. Former Town of North Hempstead Supervisor Jon Kaiman, <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/07/one-most-competitive-long-island-primaries-recent-memory-five-candidates-vie-replace-tom-suozzi/375103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another centrist</a>, is the last serious contender: He’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY03170/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $644,000</a> and has the support of the well-organized Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no independent polling of the primary, but a <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-cd3-primary-robert-zimmerman-lirr-electric-women-candidates-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July internal poll</a> from Zimmerman’s campaign gave him 17 percent, Kaiman 13 percent, D’Arrigo 12 percent and Lafazan 10 percent. Once you factor in the fact that internal polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to overstate their sponsors</a>, that’s consistent with a four-way toss-up. But the candidates should get used to that: Whoever wins the Democratic nod will be thrown into a highly competitive general election. While the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a> currently says Lafazan would be ever-so-slightly favored to beat presumptive GOP nominee George Santos, a more liberal candidate may be an underdog.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>4th District</strong>, Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice is also retiring, and the <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/08/long-island-supposedly-safe-democratic-district-still-reeling-2021-red-wave/375736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic primary</a> will probably decide who succeeds her in the House (though, with a D+10 partisan lean, the seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t <em>totally</em> safe</a>). On paper, the front-runner is former Town of Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen, a self-described “<a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/03/laura-gillen-hopes-to-follow-in-kathleen-rices-footsteps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate to conservative Democrat</a>” who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY04244/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$630,500</a>. However, some observers think New York Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs is <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/jay-jacobs-rice-corbett-congress-nassau-ioas4adg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">putting a thumb on the scale</a> for Malverne Village Mayor Keith Corbett, who has raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY04269/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$414,000</a>. Despite Gillen’s moderation, Jacobs <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/corbett-congress-4th-district-rice-malverne-t37045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has claimed</a> that Corbett is more electable than she is. (After Gillen allegedly told him serving in Congress has been a dream of hers since she was a little girl, Jacobs replied, “I’m not here to help people with their dreams. I’m here to elect Democrats.”) Gillen’s <a href="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/the-point/the-point-newsday-nassau-redistricting-ny-primary-turnout-laura-gillen-o7kc32fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a> say she has nothing to worry about, but we’ll be keeping an eye on this race just the same.</p>

By far the one that has gotten the most attention is in the <strong>19th District</strong>, which became vacant after Democratic Rep. Antonio Delgado <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-antonio-delgado-lieutenant-governor-hochul-albany-20220525-cj45ukhvonh3nfdaelyq6epyku-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned to become lieutenant governor</a>. Now, Republicans believe they have an excellent chance to flip this R+4 seat. The National Republican Campaign Committee has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cmte=NRCC&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> attacking the Democratic candidate, Ulster County Executive Pat Ryan, with ads like <a href="https://nrcc.org/2022/08/03/new-ny-19-tv-ad-criminals-and-coddlers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> focused on public safety. Meanwhile, Republican Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro is a GOP rising star who still garners name recognition for his unsuccessful 2018 gubernatorial campaign, when he carried this district by <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2018/general/2018GovByCD.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 percentage points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All we have to go off here are internal polls, but we can triangulate that Molinaro is probably a slight favorite. In late July, a <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/02/marc-molinaro-leads-pat-ryan-in-ny-congressional-race-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll commissioned by a pro-Molinaro group</a> found the Republican ahead 50 percent to 40 percent. But then, in early August, a <a href="https://twitter.com/mahoneyw/status/1559233246721974277?s=20&amp;t=q_RPwV3F_nJuRJwQVDijfA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCCC poll</a> put Molinaro at 46 percent and Ryan at 43 percent. Since each of those polls is probably a bit biased toward their side, we can guesstimate that Molinaro’s real lead is in the mid-single digits. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is actually a chance that both Molinaro and Ryan are in Congress next year. That’s because this special election is for the old, pre-redistricting 19th District — but the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> that takes effect for November’s election carves that district up. Ryan is seeking a full term in the new <strong>18th District</strong>, the district Sean Patrick Maloney left behind. (That means Ryan is running in a Democratic primary in a different district at the same time he is competing in this special election. However, he shouldn’t have much trouble defeating his two underfunded opponents, CNN contributor Aisha Mills and financial adviser Moses Mugulusi.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Molinaro is seeking a full term in the <strong>new 19th District</strong>, where he is unopposed in the Republican primary, but in this district, there <em>is</em> a primary to watch on the Democratic side. Attorney Josh Riley has raised the most cash overall (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NY22177/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.4 million</a>), but business owner Jamie Cheney has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NY19135/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $631,000</a> in just three months of campaigning — a faster <em>rate</em> of fundraising.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/election-deniers-running-florida-york-fivethirtyeight-88692918</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s other special election is in the <strong>old 23rd District</strong>, from which Republican Rep. Tom Reed <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/05/10/ny-rep-tom-reed-resigns-cites-extremism-in-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned in May</a> in order to take a job at a lobbying firm. (That said, Reed was already <a href="https://www.localsyr.com/news/local-news/rep-tom-reed-apologizes-after-sexual-harassment-allegations-wont-run-for-governor-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not running for reelection</a> in light of allegations that he had made unwanted sexual advances toward a lobbyist.) Given the seat’s R+15 partisan lean, Steuben County Republican Party Chair Joe Sempolinski is the odds-on favorite to defeat Tioga County Democratic Committee Chair Max Della Pia (however, because Sempolinski is not running in the regularly scheduled primary, he would serve in Congress for only a few months). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re still watching the margin, though, because of what it could say about the national political environment. When one party consistently does better in special elections than the partisan lean of districts would suggest, it has historically been a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good sign for that party</a> in the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming midterms</a>. And while special elections overall since Biden’s inauguration <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-can-special-elections-so-far-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t advantaged one party over the other</a>, things may have shifted since the Dobbs decision in late June. Democrats outperformed their partisan baseline in the two special elections following the decision. The margin in Nebraska’s 1st District was 12 points better for Democrats than partisan lean would have predicted, and the margin in Minnesota’s 1st was 11 points better.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That said, last Tuesday, Alaska held a special House election where <em>Republicans</em> are currently doing 8 points better than partisan lean would suggest — but it’s hard to know how much stock to put in that. That election used ranked-choice voting, and the ranked-choice tabulations haven’t taken place yet (that 8-point overperformance is based solely on voters’ first-place votes). In addition, many absentee ballots still haven’t been counted yet, so the margin of first-place votes will probably change as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is where the special elections in New York will come in handy. They’ll give us two more data points, allowing us to say with more certainty whether the political winds have shifted. If Democrats win in the 19th District and come within, say, single digits in the 23rd, it will be a strong sign that the Dobbs decision really has given Democrats a shot in the arm. If not, though, we may not be in a Democratic-leaning political environment after all.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Ohio is the type of Senate race that Democrats shouldn’t have much business competing in. The state is increasingly red, having voted for former President Donald Trump by 8 percentage points in 2020. True, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown was reelected in Ohio in 2018 — but that was in a strongly Democratic environment that is unlikely to be replicated this November, in what’s expected to be a Republican-leaning year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan had led in five consecutive polls since late July until an <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/ohio-2022-jd-vance-leads-tim-ryan-in-competitive-bid-for-us-senate-gov-dewine-holds-16-point-lead-over-democratic-challenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College poll this week</a> put J.D. Vance — the Trump-endorsed venture capitalist and author of “Hillbilly Elegy” — ahead. Ryan still holds a narrow 1-point lead in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-19-at-7.43.46-AM.png?w=1424 2x"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our election forecast is … confused</a>. The Lite version of our forecast, which just uses the polls, sticks to our polling average and has Ryan as a slight 56 percent favorite.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All odds as of 9 a.m. on Aug. 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> The Classic version, which incorporates “fundamentals” such as Ohio’s Republican lean and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/06/tim-ryan-turned-his-race-surprise-senate-battleground-00050187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan’s fundraising advantage so far</a>, puts Ryan’s chances at 39 percent and Vance as a slight favorite. And the Deluxe forecast, which also accounts for <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expert race ratings</a> — in essence, the conventional wisdom that the race is an uphill climb for Democrats — has Ryan’s chances at 21 percent, making Vance a clear favorite.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ll save the value of expert ratings and the differences between the Classic and Deluxe versions of the forecast for another time. But suffice it to say that they do add to our forecast’s accuracy — or at least they’re supposed to. So there’s no need to, say, blend the Classic and Deluxe forecasts together; the Deluxe forecast should be the one you’d bet on. It already puts the “right” amount of weight on the expert ratings, based on what would have produced the best forecasts empirically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even a 21 percent chance isn’t nothing. So let’s step back and ask a more basic question: Is it <em>plausible</em> that Ryan could win in a state like Ohio in a political environment like the one we’re likely to see in November?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ohio is 12.4 points more Republican than the country as a whole, based on FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric, which is derived from the past two presidential elections and recent state legislative elections.<a data-footnote-id="26" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> And it’s not as though Ohio just had a special thing for Trump, either; lately, it’s been GOP across the board, except for Brown. All of its statewide elected officeholders are Republicans, and both the state House and Senate are strongly Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To better understand the odds Ryan faces, we can create what I call a “simple fundamentals” forecast by adding a state’s partisan lean to the generic congressional ballot’s margin, or the margin by which one of the two parties is winning the race for Congress. (This differs from the more complicated fundamentals formula that our forecast uses, but it still serves as a good sanity check.) And if we add Ohio’s 12.4-point Republican lean to Democrats’ 0.5-point <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead on the generic ballot</a>, the simple fundamentals forecast predicts that Vance will win by 11.9 points.<a data-footnote-id="27" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the generic ballot margin favors Democrats, we actually subtract D+0.5 from R+12.4 for R+11.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But of course, the political climate may not look like this by November. Our forecast, for instance, still thinks it’s more likely than not that the political environment ends up being somewhat Republican leaning. And if, say, the environment winds up favoring the GOP by 3 points, the simple fundamentals forecast would predict Vance wins by around 15 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This raises the question of whether there are recent examples of a Senate candidate outperforming the simple fundamentals forecast by 15 points? Or for that matter — let’s say the political climate remains pretty decent for Democrats — even 10 or 12 points?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The short answer is: Yes. But 10 points versus 15 points makes a pretty big difference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s go back to the last midterm in 2018. Here’s what a simple fundamentals forecast would have shown in each Senate race (excluding a handful of unconventional races)<a data-footnote-id="28" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Vermont and Maine, the winning candidate was technically an independent, although both Sens. Bernie Sanders and Angus King caucus with the Democrats. There was no Republican candidate in California. In the Mississippi special election, a nonpartisan election was held on Nov. 6 with a runoff later. And in New Mexico, Libertarian Gary Johnson was a significant factor, receiving 15 percent of the vote. We’ve excluded these Senate races from our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a> based on FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean as we calculated it at the time, and the generic ballot, which favored Democrats by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.6 points</a> that year. (Conveniently, the generic ballot was very accurate that year: Democrats also won the House popular vote by 8.6 points.)</p>

 <p>We excluded 2018 Senate races in California, Maine, Vermont, New Mexico and the Mississippi special election from our analysis.</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Out of 30 conventional Senate races, the simple fundamentals prediction was off by 10 points or more in eight races. Democratic incumbents outperformed the fundamentals by double digits in Minnesota (Sen. Amy Klobuchar), Montana (Sen. Jon Tester), North Dakota (Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, although she lost anyway) and West Virginia — with Sen. Joe Manchin beating the simple fundamentals projection by an astounding 25 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democratic incumbents underperformed the simple fundamentals by at least 10 points in Massachusetts (Sen. Elizabeth Warren), New Jersey (Sen. Bob Menendez) and Rhode Island (Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse), while Republican incumbent Sen. Roger Wicker outperformed them by 12 points in Mississippi.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, what we can learn from the 2018 midterms is that even in this era of high partisanship, meaningful divergences from the simple fundamentals aren’t <em>that</em> uncommon in midterm years. With that said, they aren’t routine either, and they usually require something a little bit different to be going on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Being an extremely popular incumbent is one way a candidate can overperform the fundamentals, but that doesn’t apply to Ryan. And for what it’s worth, while his margin of victory in his House district was quite spectacular in 2016 — 36 points, in a district that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won by just under 7 points that year — it was less spectacular in 2020, when he drew a more competitive challenger and won by about 8 in a district that President Biden won by 3 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moderate candidates also sometimes outperform the fundamentals, as Manchin and Heitkamp did in 2018, whereas right- or left-wing candidates can underperform them, as in the case of Warren. Does that apply in Ohio? Maybe, but it’s a little bit of a stretch. Ryan’s website <a href="https://timforoh.com/a-post-partisan-populist-tim-ryans-momentim-cuts-through-the-noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brands him</a> as a “post-partisan populist,” but he’s no Manchin. Instead, he has a fairly typical Democratic voting record — he’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/tim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted with Biden 100 percent of the time in this current Congress, for instance</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then again, Ryan’s current advantage in Ohio may have less to do with him and more to do with Vance. Inexperienced candidates tend <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to underperform in Senate races</a>, and Vance has never run for office before.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/democrats-chance-winning-senate-races-ohio-north-carolina-88658882</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Ryan might also have some success in portraying Vance as being too far to the right — Vance previously <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/j-d-vance-ditches-past-161011851.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported cutting Social Security and Medicare</a> — and Ohio has a history of preferring relatively moderate Republicans, such as outgoing Sen. Rob Portman and former Gov. John Kasich. However, in Vance’s case, perhaps it’s safer to say that his views have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/01/04/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-radicalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all over the place</a> as he was willing to change course to win Trump’s endorsement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, another way to underperform the fundamentals is to be tinged by scandal, as Menendez was in 2018 (although the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/nyregion/senator-robert-menendez-corruption.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corruption case against him ended in a mistrial</a>). But there’s nothing comparable in Vance’s case.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that said, there’s nothing that says you need “one neat trick” to win a Senate race. You can grab a little bit from different buckets. Maybe Ryan isn’t Manchin, but maybe he succeeds in presenting himself as a populist moderate, outperforming a generic Democrat by a few percentage points. Maybe Vance’s inexperience makes him easier to define, and Ryan can characterize him as the <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1522349065736015872?s=20&amp;t=QE6wu5-4btZ6gf42Tl6B8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worst of both worlds</a>: too much of a sell-out to Trump for Kasich-voting moderates in the suburbs and too much of a sell-out to Wall Street for blue-collar voters in the exurbs. Ohio is red, but it isn’t Mississippi or Wyoming. It isn’t <em>that</em> high a hurdle to overcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So there are two things I think we can be certain about. First, this will be <em>much</em> easier for Ryan to pull off if the political climate in November winds up favoring Democrats by a couple of points rather than favoring Republicans instead. Yes, it’s a small sample size, but there were plenty of candidates in 2018 who beat the “simple fundamentals” by 10 points; only Manchin did so by more than 15 points, however. Second, Ryan would be much better off if the election was held today instead of in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not that I don’t necessarily believe the polls now, although it’s certainly worth mentioning that Ohio is in a part of the country where the polls have done quite poorly in recent elections. Biden trailed Trump by only 1 point in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Ohio polling average</a>, for instance, but lost the state by 8 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if I were convinced that pollsters have fixed their problems in the Midwest, there are a couple of things that would make me nervous as a Democrat. One is the relatively high number of undecided voters in the race. In our polling average, Ryan has 43.9 percent and Vance has 42.7 percent, meaning that 13.4 percent of voters are not committed to either candidate. That’s on the high side at this stage for a Senate race. It may reflect the fact that Vance is not a terribly familiar name, but Republican voters in Ohio may not care once they see the “R” beside it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This relatively narrow polling advantage for Ryan is also coming at a time when Ryan is <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/columbus/2022/07/20/tim-ryans-ad-strategy-right-leaning-ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using his fundraising advantage to dominate the airwaves</a>. Reinforcements are <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/08/national-republican-group-plans-massive-ad-buy-boosting-jd-vance-signaling-deepening-gop-focus-on-ohios-senate-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming for Vance</a>, though, so Ryan might lose that advantage by November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So does Ryan have a chance? Yes, absolutely. But I think the Deluxe version of the forecast probably does a pretty good job of pegging Ryan’s chances to roughly 1 in 5.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In most parts of the country, the truth has been inescapable this summer. As the U.S. suffers through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/heat-wave-northeast-records.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heat waves</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/31/us/california-mckinney-fire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfires</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/us-drought-august-2022-1849377876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">droughts</a>, climate change feels right at our doorstep (and for those of us without air conditioning, doubly so). While climate change is not solely responsible for these harsh weather conditions, it has made <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/how-to-live-with-it/weather.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them more frequent and more severe</a>. And Americans say they are feeling it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A majority of Americans — 71 percent — said their local community has endured at least one of five forms of extreme weather over the last year: heat, flooding, drought, wildfires or rising sea levels, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/08/12/most-americans-who-have-faced-extreme-weather-see-a-link-to-climate-change-republicans-included/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a survey from the Pew Research Center</a> conducted in May. And regardless of the type experienced, a majority of those who had faced such weather said climate change played a role. This is true even among Republicans, who are generally <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/more-americans-are-pessimistic-about-the-impact-they-can-have-on-climate-change-compared-to-three-years-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to believe</a> climate change is happening. For Republicans who said their local community had experienced extreme heat, for example, 79 percent said climate change contributed a lot or a little, while 21 percent said climate change did not contribute at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether or not they’ve experienced it firsthand, most Americans are worried about climate change. In <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/08/11140636/2207099_crosstabs_MC_ENERGY_SINGLE_USE_PLASTIC_Adults_v1_CC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Morning Consult poll</a> from July, 73 percent of Americans said they were at least somewhat concerned about climate change, including 39 percent who said they were very concerned. However, in this case, public opinion is split along partisan lines. While 91 percent of Democrats said they were very or somewhat concerned about climate change, fewer than half — 47 percent — of Republicans said the same. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, many Americans are feeling the heat and understand its causes. But what are they willing to do about it? Well, many are taking matters into their own hands and trying to make more climate-friendly choices in their personal lives. In that Morning Consult poll, 61 percent of Americans said they had changed their behavior “some” or “a lot” because of concerns about the environment. Democrats and younger Americans were more likely to say they’d changed their behavior. Sixty-six percent of Gen Z respondents said they’d changed behavior, compared with 60 percent of baby boomers and 59 percent of Gen Xers. Fewer than half of all respondents said that they stay away from single-use packaging or that they buy items with limited to no packaging. But most Americans said they recycle, use refillable water bottles, restrict their use of plastics and buy items made of recyclable materials because of concerns over the environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, while they’re willing to make these small changes, many Americans are pessimistic about how much impact individual climate-conscious decisions actually have. Just 52 percent of Americans said their actions have an effect on climate change, according to <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/more-americans-are-pessimistic-about-the-impact-they-can-have-on-climate-change-compared-to-three-years-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll</a> conducted in June. That’s down from 66 percent in 2019. And when asked who has “a great deal” or “a lot” of responsibility for addressing climate change, 45 percent of Americans said individual people did. In comparison, 63 percent said the federal government did. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And there’s substantial agreement among Americans over what the federal government can and should do to address climate change, according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/americans-support-inflation-reduction-act-measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> from earlier this month. A majority of Americans supported measures such as incentives to lower the cost of renewable energy and using government funds to promote oil and gas companies to reduce emissions. These policies are popular even among Republicans: 53 percent of Republicans supported the cost-lowering incentives and 50 percent supported funding to lower emissions from oil and gas companies. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Funnily enough, the federal government has already done both of those things — they were provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-sign-major-health-climate-tax-bill-tuesday/story?id=88412221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed into law</a> on Tuesday. It’s the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/business/biden-climate-tax-inflation-reduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most aggressive</a> climate-change law the country has ever enacted, yet many Americans appear unfamiliar with it. In that same Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted a few days before the bill passed the Senate, just 41 percent of Americans said they were familiar with the legislation. So while the effects of climate change have been hard for Americans to ignore this summer, efforts to fight it have been easier to miss.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites </strong></h2>



<ul><li>Given a list of 11 political topics, Americans were most likely to have shifted their stance on foreign policy, according to an <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/16/how-often-and-why-do-americans-change-their-minds">Aug. 3-5 YouGov survey</a>. Forty-two percent named foreign policy, with drug policy (40 percent) and health care (35 percent) not far behind. The least-chosen issue was free speech, at 17 percent. Most Americans (78 percent) reported changing opinions on one or more of the issues, but that figure varied widely by ideology: Very liberal (90 percent), liberal (86 percent) and moderate (83 percent) Americans reported a shift at higher rates than their conservative (76 percent) and very conservative (63 percent) counterparts. </li><li>An Aug. 10-16 <a href="https://civicscience.com/tiktok-rising-as-a-go-to-search-engine-among-young-shoppers/">CivicScience survey</a> revealed that almost 1 in 5 adults under age 25 (18 percent) turned to TikTok first when online shopping. That’s a much larger share than Americans overall (9 percent) or even Americans ages 25 to 34 (9 percent), according to a concurrent CivicScience survey conducted Aug. 10-15. That second survey counted Amazon as the preferred starting point for Americans researching a new purchase, at 46 percent, and Google was a clear No. 2 at 35 percent. </li><li>Texas smoked the competition in a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2022/08/15/texas-dominates-us-good-bbq">YouGov survey</a> asking Americans which states they associate with having good barbecue — 73 percent chose the Lone Star State, compared with its closest competitor, Tennessee, at 37 percent. The poll, conducted July 28-31, posed the same question for a list of 19 cities, and three of the top four were in Texas: Dallas (41 percent), Austin (38 percent) and Houston (37 percent) were highest alongside Memphis, Tennessee (38 percent). This matches <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/consumer/articles-reports/2020/07/21/americas-favorite-bbq-style">YouGov/Huffington Post polling from July 2020</a> that found Texas-style barbecue as Americans’ favorite regional variation (22 percent) over other types like Carolina- (10 percent) and Alabama-style (10 percent).</li><li><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/396893/americans-not-convinced-marijuana-benefits-society.aspx">Gallup polling conducted</a> July 5-26 found that roughly half of Americans (48 percent) have tried marijuana, a share that’s been mostly on the rise since 2013 (38 percent). While that number didn’t change much across age groups, the research found that adults under age 35 were most likely to currently smoke it (30 percent) or consume edibles (22 percent). While there were no major discrepancies among education levels or gender, political leaning was a different story: Experimenting with weed was most common among Democrats (53 percent) and independents (55 percent). Among Republicans (34 percent), the figure just wasn’t that high. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): We know the 2022 midterm elections haven’t happened yet, but this summer has seen an unusual amount of activity on the 2024 front. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Namely, many Americans, including Democrats, are <em>really</em> down on the idea of President Biden <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-unusually-lukewarm-about-a-second-biden-term/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking a second term</a>, while former President Donald Trump continues to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/technology/trump-search-misinfo-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominate the news cycle</a>. A sizable portion of Americans say they <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/07/2024-biden-trump-worst-thing-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t want Biden or Trump to have a second term</a>, but is there, uh … a path for anyone who isn’t Trump or Biden in 2024?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s tackle this chat in two parts:</p>



<ol><li>First, what is the case for — or against — any other Democratic presidential candidate breaking through?</li><li>And second, what is the case for — or against — any other Republican presidential candidate breaking through?</li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">OK, first up. Is there a Democrat who can take on Biden?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): I don’t think so, Sarah, <em>especially</em> if Trump is the nominee. If Trump announces that he’s running for a second term, I think: 1) Biden will run again, and 2) there won’t be a damaging primary to take him down. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Democrat is going to take Biden on against Trump? Democrats will coalesce around the nominee who can beat Trump, and Biden has already proved that he can.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, senior elections analyst): I’m generally someone who thinks the 2024 nominations are Biden’s and Trump’s if they want them, but I think Biden is particularly safe. There just isn’t an obvious Democratic heir apparent. The closest thing is Vice President Kamala Harris, and she’s not going to run against her own running mate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Right, Nathaniel. I just don’t see notable Democrats wanting to participate in a messy, protracted primary against the sitting president. It would be a terrible look for the party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh</strong> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/kaleigh-rogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaleigh Rogers</a>, tech and politics reporter): It’s no secret that the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/biden-2024-democrats-search-for-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic bench isn’t very deep</a>, and I’m not sure a serious candidate would want to challenge the sitting president. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an earlier time, I could maybe see Sen. Bernie Sanders stepping up to the plate and attracting a decent share of the vote, but in 2024, I don’t think he’d bother, or be successful.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Sanders has <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-2024/40285647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already said</a> that he will not run against Biden. (They’re friends!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> More like frenemies. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Ugh, we need <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/24/politics/cory-booker-andrew-yang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more political</a> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/10/29/elizabeth-warren-julian-castro-friendship-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friendship stories</a>. …</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, senior elections analyst): That’s a good point, Alex, about Democrats likely not wanting to participate in a messy primary. The order of operations to all this is very important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Trump looms large, that may encourage greater Democratic unity. Regardless, though, it’s very hard to take on an incumbent president in a primary — no incumbent has ever lost renomination in the modern presidential primary era. There have been some primary polls testing Biden against a multicandidate field that <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/HHP_July2022_KeyResults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have him leading</a> but <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Midterm2022ToplinesMay2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in the 30s</a> in terms of support. However, I don’t think a crowded field would develop if Biden were running again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, and the incumbent presidents who have faced serious renomination fights (e.g., former President Jimmy Carter) lost their subsequent general election. No Democrat will want to be blamed for tanking Biden’s chances against Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another complication: I know polls show that Democrats largely don’t want Biden to run again, but party elites aren’t acting that way. Just look at the <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/08/03/maloney-attempts-to-clean-up-comments-about-biden-s-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hubbub that ensued</a> after Rep. Carolyn Maloney said she didn’t think Biden would run again in 2024. Her primary opponents jumped all over her, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/carolyn-maloney-apologizes-to-joe-biden-for-saying-he-won-t-run-in-2024#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she had to apologize</a>! To me, that’s the sign of a party united behind their leader. (It’s almost Trump-like!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Yeah, I don’t see anyone running <em>if</em> Biden makes good on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/22/biden-confirm-2024-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his stated intention to run again</a>. But I like to imagine alternate-universe scenarios since “no one” is not a very thrilling answer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Well, if Trump doesn’t run, then I think Biden <em>maybe </em>doesn’t run. (“Maybe” is doing a lot of work here.) But to your point, Kaleigh, that opens the door for other Democrats to enter the race. It’s just that no obvious candidate comes to mind for me currently.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I’m not fully convinced that Biden saying he will run means he actually will. It would be a really bad look for the sitting president to openly say, “Yeah, no, I’m good with one term,” <em>especially</em> at this point in his presidency. But as Alex points out, if for some reason Trump doesn’t run, that does give Biden a chance to step back at the end of this term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yeah, I was going to say there are a couple of pretty big assumptions baked in here. The first is that Trump will in fact be the nominee — we’ll debate that more in a bit!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the second is that Biden actually runs again, as Kaleigh just said. That calculus could change as we get closer to 2024 and Trump isn’t the nominee.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Sarah, I would be surprised if a prominent Democrat runs against Biden. I wouldn’t be surprised, though, if he declines to run for reelection. He would be 86 years old by the end of his second term; it’s just really hard to imagine him serving at that age.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Because campaign decisions don’t always happen in an orderly fashion, it’ll be interesting to see how long Biden waits before he makes a final determination about his 2024 intentions. If Trump jumps in quickly before this November’s election or just after it, Biden will have plenty of time to decide. But if Trump were to unexpectedly wait to announce — or were even to float the idea he won’t run — that could complicate Biden’s decision-making process if he is considering not running again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I guess I’m just skeptical that Biden would throw in the towel without an obvious heir apparent — despite his age.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> I know it’s incredibly early still, but general-election polls show that one of Biden’s strongest factors as a candidate is his performance against Trump, right?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Sarah, I think Biden definitely benefits from a perception that he is still one of Democrats’ most electable options. (After all, he beat Trump in 2020.) But I’m not sure how much the data backs that up. According to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/585432015/20220801-yahoo-tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Yahoo News poll</a> from the beginning of the month, registered voters picked Biden over Trump 45 percent to 42 percent. But they also picked Harris over Trump 45 percent to 44 percent. That’s not a significant difference. And that’s before even getting into the fact that 2024 is two years away and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early general-election polls are pretty meaningless</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> It largely depends on the pollster as to whether Biden leads or Trump leads, but on balance, Biden may lead slightly more often than not. I do think, though, some Democrats believe anyone other than Biden might be weaker against Trump. It’s a question of the known vs. the unknown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Maybe part of the calculus against Biden seeking a second term is that Democrats just don’t want him to, as Nathaniel and Sarah hinted at earlier. A July <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-president-joe-biden-approval-rating-july-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll</a> found that Biden is facing his lowest approval rating since taking office — and Democrats are a large part of the reason why. Per the survey, Biden’s overall approval rating sits at 36 percent, a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-president-joe-biden-approval-rating-july-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-percentage-point drop from the end of June</a>. Most of the discontent appears to be coming within Biden’s own party, too. There was a 9-point decline among Democrats between the two polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, 75 percent of Democrats said they approve of the job Biden is doing as president. Compare that with the previous month, though, when 84 percent of Democrats felt the same. And surprising no one, his approval rating among Republican voters is much, much lower. In July, only 5 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of independent voters approved of the job Biden is doing (which is on par with how Republicans felt in late June, too).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Is it unusual that Biden is this unpopular, especially among members of his own party?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Well, on the one hand, presidential approval <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often declines</a> in a president’s first term. I’d bet, too, that Democrats were especially optimistic after Biden beat Trump and Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate, but that they were then disappointed after Biden’s administration failed to address a number of key issues he campaigned on, e.g., <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062070001/student-loan-forgiveness-debt-president-biden-campaign-promise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a student loan forgiveness program</a>, an overhaul of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-experts-say-biden-administration-is-failing-on-immigration-2022-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. immigration system</a>, etc. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, Biden has had to continue navigating America’s response to the pandemic, which has been messy, along with unexpected events like <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/23/statement-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine</a> and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/14/biden-economy-afl-cio-00039580" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faltering economy</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> The fact, though, that Biden’s approval rating is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at 70 to 75 percent among Democrats</a> is unusual. <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/trump-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2000-01-01&amp;maxdate=2022-08-17&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=yes&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20D,A%20-%20i,RV,RV%20-%20D,RV%20-%20i,LV,LV%20-%20D,LV%20-%20i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Both Trump</a> and former President <a href="https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=100&amp;mindate=2008-01-01&amp;maxdate=2022-08-17&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=no&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A,A%20-%20R,A%20-%20i,RV,RV%20-%20R,RV%20-%20i,LV,LV%20-%20R,LV%20-%20i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=approve,disapprove&amp;fudge=0.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barack Obama</a> usually had approval ratings of at least 80 percent or more among members of their own party, although they did occasionally dip below that mark. Where Biden goes from here — back up or stagnant — could be important to determining whether he runs again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Not to mention that until very recently Biden also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-record-low-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the lowest approval rating</a> of any president since the end of World War II. It’s slowly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inched back up</a>, but he’s still underwater overall.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/newsletter-images/biden-approval-rating-2.png"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But OK, a lot of you have said there is “no heir apparent” when it comes to a Democrat who isn’t Biden. This isn’t a 2024 draft — soon, right? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉"> — but what does the Democratic bench look like <em>if</em> Biden doesn’t run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> If Biden’s not at the table, then Harris is an obvious choice. Not only is she veep, but also she held her own during the 2020 primaries and could follow a similar trajectory as Biden himself did, using his record during the Obama administration to build out the basic platform planks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, Kaleigh. Any discussion of Democratic candidates beyond Biden has to start with Harris. Sitting vice presidents who run to succeed their presidential ticket-mate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-had-to-fight-for-the-presidential-nomination-but-most-vps-have-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost always win the party’s nomination</a>. You’d have to go back to Democratic Vice President Alben Barkley <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2009/07/on_this_day_in_1952_vp_alben_b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1952</a> — so prior to the modern primary era — to find one who didn’t. Granted, the last person in this situation was Vice President Al Gore in 2000, and he, of course, didn’t end up winning the general election. So there is that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> But Harris’s 2020 campaign <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happened-to-the-kamala-harris-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t great</a>. That said, I did find this survey interesting: A May <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/key-results-may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard University/Harris poll</a> shows that 19 percent of Democratic and independent voters would want Harris to run if Biden doesn’t seek a second term. (She was voters’ top choice). After Harris, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (!!) and Sanders both came in at 10 percent, while U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg netted 7 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The only problem for Harris is that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her approval rating</a> is even lower than Biden’s right now. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chat.2024.0818-2.png?w=1424 2x"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> True, Sarah. Democrats do have other options, though. Buttigieg clearly wants to be president too, and he doesn’t have an obvious other office to run for. Democrats also have a fairly deep bench of governors and such who could run if they want — Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Jared Polis of Colorado, etc.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK. Is it fair to say that we’re all in agreement that there is not room for anyone else in the Democratic primary aside from Biden — unless, of course, he doesn’t run?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yes!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> The fact that no one easily comes to mind tells me … yes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, time to talk about the Republican side of things. Is there room for any one else other than Trump?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-republican-rally-ron-desantis-kari-lake-blake-masters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/29/pence-iowa-2024-campaign-00048716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Vice President Mike Pence</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2021/magazine-nikki-haleys-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley</a>, <a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/political-news/2022-03-12/former-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-makes-another-trip-to-iowa-raising-2024-speculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2022/08/11/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-flips-pork-chops-iowa-state-fair-talks-2024-prospects-gop-donald-trump/10298565002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan</a> all seem to be lining up to run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of those, DeSantis is the only one who (currently) seems capable of defeating Trump should the former president indeed run. In fact, if Pence, Haley, Pompeo and Hogan were all to run, that would arguably be good for Trump. After all, we saw in 2016 that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/explaining-the-presidential-primary-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican primaries’ use</a> of winner-take-all or winner-take-most delegate systems helped Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/25/donald-trump-is-now-just-a-handful-of-delegates-from-truly-clinching-the-gop-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty handily win the nomination</a> with only a <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plurality of the primary vote</a>. So if you get a number of candidates splitting up the vote not going for Trump, it’s just going to make it easier for him to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> The Republican ticket is a little more interesting. You’re not challenging a sitting president, and there certainly seems to be at least <em>some</em> hesitancy over Trump and the idea that he has too much baggage and might not be able to win in a general election … again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/us/politics/trump-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> from last month found, for instance, that almost half of Americans who planned to vote in the 2024 Republican primary would choose a candidate other than Trump in a primary race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Yesssss, Kaleigh. I’m glad you brought up that poll, because I thought that was an interesting way to frame the results, as one could also argue from that poll that Trump is still the undisputed leader. He was first, with 49 percent support, and DeSantis was in second, at 25 percent. No other candidate broke the double digits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> There is definitely more room for a challenger to Trump than to Biden, but Trump would still be favored. According to a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/11/fbi-raid-increases-trumps-2024-primary-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico/Morning Consult poll</a>, 56 percent of Republican and independent registered voters said they would support Trump, while 18 percent said they would support DeSantis, 8 percent said they would support Pence and a bunch of other candidates all got 2 percent or less. Even if you look at head-to-head matchups between Trump and DeSantis, Trump wins, albeit by a narrower margin. According to that YouGov/Yahoo News poll I mentioned earlier, Trump beats DeSantis 44 percent to 35 percent among registered voters in a direct matchup.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> Absolutely, but this point (from the Times reporting on the poll) was an interesting comparison to me: “His share of the Republican primary electorate is less than Hillary Clinton’s among Democrats was at the outset of the 2016 race.” Of course, Clinton ultimately won that race, but it wasn’t a guarantee — Sanders gave her a real run for her money.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Eh, Kaleigh, you can cherry-pick one historical example to make basically whatever point you want to make. The Times could have also compared Trump to Gore’s position in 1999. He, of course, went on to win the primary without much trouble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, DeSantis is clearly a legitimate threat to Trump; a 9-point lead in the polls is not secure. That’s especially true since Trump has universal name recognition, while DeSantis doesn’t. That implies he has more room to grow.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> I know we had a chat back in the day about whether <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trumps-hold-on-the-gop-still-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s grip on the GOP is still strong</a>. At the time, I said that Trump may be weaker than some would like to admit, but after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuesday night’s results</a> — most notably Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s primary loss coupled with the fates of the nine other Republicans who voted to impeach the former president — I actually think it’ll be really hard for another Republican to cut through his power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sure, Trump hasn’t won every race he’s got involved in (think <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/26/donald-trump-georgia-kemp-raffensperger/9922677002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp</a> or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-cheney-and-murkowski-survive-their-trump-backed-primary-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski</a>, who will each advance to the general election), but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-candidate-lost-in-nebraska-but-trump-is-still-winning-most-of-his-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he still has a pretty good track record overall</a> of endorsing candidates that win. Moreover, I just don’t see an obvious heir apparent to the GOP, either.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh: </strong>What you all are saying is<strong> </strong>fair, but do you all not see any evidence of Republicans getting nervous about Trump as a candidate?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> The reality is that it’s just very hard to answer this question definitively. I do think we’ve seen some cracks in Trump’s influence, as we debated earlier this year. Polls like the one from The New York Times you<strong> </strong>cited earlier, Kaleigh, also clearly show that Trump isn’t entirely unopposed. There are more subtle things happening behind the scenes, too, like Fox News and the Murdoch conservative empire <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/07/30/rupert-lachlan-murdoch-donald-trump-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly distancing themselves from Trump</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s still too early to place any stock <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in these general-election polls</a>, but we’re not <em>too</em> far away from the point when early primary polls will be useful, and what we’ve seen in our analysis of 40-plus years of early primary polls is that it’s really hard for people who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t household names to break through</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/skelley.PRIMARY-POLLS-3.0418-3.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">We knew early on, for instance, that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-weve-gleaned-about-the-democratic-primary-from-6-months-of-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden was the front-runner</a>. So the question for me now is whether anyone on the Republican side can clear Trump’s name recognition, and I don’t know the answer to that … yet.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I think there’s at least some evidence Republicans are worried about Trump’s candidacy. A <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-losing-gop-support-2024-run-jan-6-hearings-unfold-poll-1727112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos poll from July</a> found that about a third of Republicans said Trump should not run again, and that’s an increase from six weeks earlier, when they asked the same question and just 26 percent of Republicans said Trump shouldn’t run. That said, a majority of Republicans disagreed with the idea that Trump should not run. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All I’m saying, though, is there may be a little more room for a challenger on the GOP side than on the Democratic side if the presumptive candidate runs again. I wonder, too, whether <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/trump-lawsuits-investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s protracted legal troubles</a> will affect the share of Republicans who don’t want him to run. Maybe. Maybe not. At any rate, Republicans will likely still face an uphill battle in overcoming Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> For me, it comes down to whether Trump still has <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorability rating north of 80 percent among Republicans</a>. Because polls at this point are still largely telling us that Republicans would vote for Trump if he ran again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Admittedly, Republicans don’t yet know the alternatives that will be available to them. But considering <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jun/14/most-republicans-falsely-believe-trumps-stolen-ele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around two-thirds</a> of Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t believe Trump lost</a> in the first place, it’s not hard to imagine a lot of them still backing him once we get into the presidential primary season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It’s still <em>very</em> early, though! Someone like DeSantis, for instance, has to win his governor’s race first before he can go all in on 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But say Trump did announce now, though, or in the lead-up to the midterms, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/politics/trump-republicans-campaign-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as has been hinted</a>, that would be kind of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-first-2020-candidate-is-hold-on-i-had-the-name-right-here-john-delaney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a John Delaney move</a>, no? Like a little <em>too</em> thirsty?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I’m not sure his supporters would see it that way, Sarah. To them, it might just be starting the party early.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Fair. OK, where do folks stand on this question of whether there’s room for someone other than Trump in the GOP? I think there might be more disagreement?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It’s pretty clear that there is some room for a Trump challenger. The question is just whether there’s enough, and if so, whether the opposition will be too divided to take advantage of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>kaleigh:</strong> I think there is space for a challenger in the GOP, but that challenger will still have a real hard time overcoming Trump’s popularity, and if there’s more than one challenger splitting the few non-Trump votes, it will be a snowball’s-chance-in-hell scenario.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> I haven’t had a chance to dig into old primary polling data yet regarding this question, but DeSantis’s situation strikes me as interesting. He’s a first-term governor who was only a three-term House member before that, yet he’s already polling pretty well in national polls of GOP presidential primary voters. That’s unusual! And I do think it means that he has a pretty high ceiling of potential support even against Trump, and that he maybe could best Trump in a largely head-to-head matchup. But as we’ve all noted at this point, the more candidates, the better it probably is for Trump. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Hmm, I don’t know. I just don’t think there’s an obvious GOP heir to Trump. I know other names have been mentioned, but they just don’t have the same power over voters that Trump currently has.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday was a test for some big names in the Republican Party in Wyoming and Alaska. Most notably, Rep. Liz Cheney lost her primary to Harriet Hageman in Wyoming by an even wider margin than expected. Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, only two will advance to the November general election, as the other eight have either retired or lost their midterm primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses what Cheney might do next with her message and what an independent bid for president might entail. They also look at the early vote tallies in Alaska to get a sense of whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski will win the general election and whether former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin will be headed to Washington too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s political future <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-liz-cheney-cant-rely-on-democrats-to-save-her-in-wyomings-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had long been in jeopardy</a>. From voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to <a href="https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1389225154639695881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly refuting</a> his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, Cheney has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-trump-election-falsehood/2021/05/01/7bd380a0-a921-11eb-8c1a-56f0cb4ff3b5_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Trump’s harshest critics</a>. Now that outspokenness has come with a price.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The daughter of one of America’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2009/01/15/99422633/cheney-a-vp-with-unprecedented-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful vice presidents</a> lost to her main primary challenger, attorney Harriet Hageman, by around 20 points, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wyoming-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=88249850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on incomplete returns</a> as of 10:30 p.m. Eastern. Hageman’s path to victory was pretty straightforward. She entered the race against Cheney <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-effort-unseat-rep-liz/story?id=79922266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Trump’s endorsement</a> and consolidated support among most anti-Cheney primary voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while Cheney’s loss is particularly high-profile, it is not surprising. Of the 10 House Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach Trump</a>, only two advanced to the general election, four lost their primaries and four didn’t even try to seek reelection, retiring instead.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A question we had going into this primary cycle was just how many pro-impeachment Republicans would still be in the House in 2023. The answer we now know is two at most. Republicans may say in polls that the GOP <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/03/11/biden-viewed-positively-on-many-issues-but-public-is-less-confident-he-can-unify-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should accept elected Republicans who <em>disagree</em> with the party</a>, but there is clearly little appetite for those who have rebuked Trump in this way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in analyzing why these representatives lost — or narrowly prevailed, in the case of Reps. David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington — there are few clear patterns. The electoral impact of the impeachment vote ranged across the ideological spectrum, from districts that lean Democratic to those that are solidly Republican. For instance, Valadao hailed from the bluest seat of this group, while Newhouse survived in a considerably red district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s probably <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/07/24/top-two-primary-in-washington-dethrones-trump-00047532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a coincidence</a> that both Valadao and Newhouse won in states that use a top-two primary system. In that format, all voters can cast a ballot that includes every candidate, regardless of party, whereas party primaries mostly involve voters who are either registered with that party or generally back it and who are voting only for candidates from one party. Still, Valadao, the only pro-impeachment Republican running who didn’t face a Trump-endorsed challenger, <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2022-primary/sov/86-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barely edged out</a> fellow Republican Chris Mathys, <a href="https://www.ourvalleyvoice.com/2021/04/16/chris-mathys-holds-town-hall-in-campaign-against-valadao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ardent Trump supporter</a>, 26 percent to 23 percent for second place in his top-two primary.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrat in the race took first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> Newhouse didn’t do much better, essentially tying with the lone Democrat in the race with <a href="https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20220802/congressional-district-4-us-representative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 percent</a>.<br></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, not a single pro-impeachment Republican captured a majority of the GOP primary vote. This amounts to an especially weak set of performances for incumbents, who in most cases easily win their primaries.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It also suggests that Valadao and Newhouse’s survival involved at least a little luck. The fact that Valadao faced two <a href="https://www.bakersfield.com/news/candidates-color-outside-partisan-lines-in-purple-district/article_349eeb16-d32d-11ec-a962-a306c4d7037e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-Trump opponents</a>, neither of whom landed the former president’s endorsement, likely made it easier for him to squeak out a victory compared with someone like Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan’s 3rd District, who faced one <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-congress-michigan-grand-rapids-impeachments-bfbb4564f73f2afdda6c5dbcb969c4ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-backed challenger and narrowly</a> lost <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michigan-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent to 48 percent</a>. Similarly, had Newhouse faced just one pro-Trump challenger instead of several, he may have been doomed, as collectively his Republican opponents won nearly half of the top-two primary vote — about twice what Newhouse garnered. But instead, they split the anti-Newhouse vote, and he survived.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Factors besides Trump, though, played at least some role in these primaries. For instance, in the two bluest seats on this list — those contested by Valadao and Meijer — <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-07-13/essential-politics-democrats-buying-ads-gop-far-right-candidates-essential-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary meddling</a> by Democratic-aligned groups may have had an effect on the outcome. Take Mathys. He didn’t have Trump’s endorsement, but <a href="https://sjvsun.com/news/politics/in-battle-against-valadao-chris-mathys-gets-a-big-lift-from-nancy-pelosi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside spending</a> by House Majority PAC, an important campaign arm for House Democrats, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;id=1153696525417340&amp;view_all_page_id=228754857151053&amp;search_type=page&amp;media_type=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran ads touting</a> Mathys’s support for Trump. And in Michigan’s 3rd District, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent nearly $450,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/x5XVRDC50Do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running ads attacking</a> Gibbs as “too conservative for west Michigan” at a time when he <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=MI03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had almost no outside help</a> to combat <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MI/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meijer’s huge spending edge</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Outside forces aside from Trump also likely influenced the four Republicans who said they wouldn’t seek reelection. Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-will-survive-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced a serious primary challenge</a> from former Trump aide Max Miller, but he also faced redistricting uncertainty, reflected in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/senate_gop_proposal_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial plan</a> drawn by Ohio Republicans that split Gonzalez’s old seat into four different districts (it was <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/14/redistricting-ohio-supreme-court-decision-congressional-map-gerrymandering/9119566002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later thrown out by the state judiciary</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/revised_republican_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a>). Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger was in a similar boat, as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his district was dismantled</a> by Illinois Democrats. The same <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/john-katko-retiring-new-york-republican/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was true of New York Rep. John Katko</a>: New York Democrats sought to draw him into a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bluer district</a>, although the eventual map <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was invalidated</a> and replaced with one drawn by a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/court_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court-appointed expert</a>. And longtime Michigan Rep. Fred Upton <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/22/fred-upton-running-congress-tv-ads/6898798001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered running again</a> for a while, even though redistricting <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2021/12/michigans-longest-serving-congressman-fred-upton-placed-in-same-district-as-fellow-republican-bill-huizenga.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threw him together</a> with more conservative Rep. Bill Huizenga, who <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/03/11/trump-endorses-huizenga-reelection-4th-district/7009427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump ultimately backed</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet of the six incumbents who ultimately sought reelection, they didn’t necessarily enter their races as underdogs. All outspent their top primary opponents, and they usually had more outside help, too. It just wasn’t enough to overcome the anger within the GOP base over their impeachment votes. Tellingly, all six had faced some sort of official censure by a local and/or state party committee following their vote against Trump.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to November, it’s possible the rebuke continues as only one House Republican out of the 10 who voted to impeach Trump is currently favored to make it to the next Congress. Given the red hue of Newhouse’s seat and the fact that he faces a Democrat in the general, the FiveThirtyEight 2022 election forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/washington/4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puts him as <em>very likely</em> to win reelection</a>. But Valadao is in a tougher reelection fight, which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s forecast</a> currently rates as a pure toss-up. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s likely Cheney as well as the nine other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump knew their vote was a potentially risky move for their political careers. But in January 2021, few would have predicted that only two would survive their primaries.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Conventional wisdom suggests that members of opposing political parties <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-really-really-dislike-biden-but-its-not-just-about-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t like each other</a> — and I mean <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>really </em>don’t like each other</a>. But what does it mean when members of your own party are seemingly aching to get you out of office too? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar must be asking herself that question <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ilhan-omar-squeaks-victory-tuesday-night-primary-surprises/story?id=88165446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after nearly losing her primary</a> on Aug. 9. She is a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the progressive group</a> of mostly women of color commonly known as “the Squad,” and a week rarely goes by without one of them making headlines: New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/style/aoc-met-gala-dress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly admonished</a> by both fans and critics for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/07/27/fact-check-aoc-arrested-during-protest-supreme-court/10117539002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged political stunts</a>; Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democratic-congresswoman-apologizes-distraction-caused-calling-trump-motherf-n956231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stirred controversy</a> in 2019 for dropping the F-bomb while calling for then-President Donald Trump’s impeachment; and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley <em>and </em>New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/reps-ayanna-pressley-jamaal-bowman-tweet-delete-defense-will-smiths-os-rcna21787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced blowback</a> in March for posting and then later deleting tweets that seemed to defend actor Will Smith for slapping comedian Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Omar isn’t the only one who’s attracted negative headlines over the years. But it does seem as if Omar routinely receives the most flak from both Republicans and<em> </em>Democrats. It’s a hard thing to quantify, but she may even be the Squad’s <em>most</em> controversial member.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, there is no one explanation for why Omar is seemingly so disliked. Perhaps more than her fellow Squad members, she has repeatedly questioned the U.S. government’s relationship with Israel in ways that have angered members of both parties. There was the time in 2019 when she responded to a tweet and said the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group, was “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/07/700901834/minnesota-congresswoman-ignites-debate-on-israel-and-anti-semitism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all about the Benjamins</a>,” a comment that angered lawmakers from her own party (not to mention the GOP) because it invoked historical anti-Semitic tropes linking Jewish people with money and power. Then there was the time in 2021 when she compared the actions of the U.S. and Israel to those of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57436573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">militant Islamist groups Hamas and the Taliban</a>. But it’s not just her criticism of U.S. policy on Israel; she’s also had problems with politics at home. In fact, her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/us/politics/ilhan-omar-policing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for a 2021 ballot initiative</a> to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety may have turned off moderate Democratic voters in her primary last Tuesday, for example. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many members of the Squad have experienced <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/14/trump-congress-go-back-where-they-came-from-1415692" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist attacks</a>, but as a Muslim woman born in Somalia, Omar may be uniquely vulnerable to a particularly toxic mix of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007372113/trump-biden-ilhan-omar-minnesota.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virulence and xenophobia</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The fact that Omar still wears the hijab is a reminder that she’s maybe ‘not one of us’ or that she’s different,” said <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/mdminta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Minta</a>, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, who specializes in congressional politics as well as race and ethnic politics. In fact, Omar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is the first to wear a hijab</a> in Congress, and while Minta did say that fellow Squad member Tlaib, who is also Muslim, sometimes wears <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46751362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional Palestinian clothes</a>, she doesn’t do it often. “Omar, on the other hand, is a visible representation of what Islam is. She’s also Black. And that intersection makes her a lightning rod,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Multiple Squad members have faced primary challengers this year. Omar and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/us/elections/results-missouri-us-house-district-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri</a> had four, Tlaib and Bowman had three<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowman had three challengers until one of them &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jaffe4NY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suspended his campaign&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>17</sup></a> but Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley had <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2022/02/02/massachusetts-congressional-races-draw-few-challenges-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none</a>. Only Omar has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minnesota-2022-primary-results/story?id=88109247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come close to being defeated</a>. (We don’t yet know how Bowman will fare in his primary on Aug. 23, <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/bowman-challenger-vedat-gashi-announces-470k-initial-fundraising-haul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but fundraising suggests</a> he may have a fight on his hands.) Still, Bush <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/missouri-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat her nearest primary opponent</a> by about 43 percentage points; Tlaib won <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michigan-2022-primary-election-results/story?id=87750801" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by about 41 points</a>. Omar, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/09/us/elections/results-minnesota-us-house-district-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by only 2 points</a>. In fact, Omar is the <em>only</em> Squad member to face back-to-back competitive primaries <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/31/18014442/midterms-election-2018-ilhan-omar-minnesota-5th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following her initial 2018 win.</a></p>

</footer></section><p data-paragraph="main">Unpacking why Omar’s most recent primary was so close, though, is hard for the reasons I cited earlier. “Anti-Muslim sentiment certainly plays a role,” said <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/shadi-hamid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadi Hamid</a>, a senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution who studies the intersection of religion and politics. “But it’s hard to know <em>how </em>much it plays a role in this specific case because you would have to disentangle that from the fact that [Omar’s] outspoken; she’s controversial; she wears the hijab and talks about Israel more than most members of Congress.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The University of Minnesota’s Minta, however, pointed to a number of missteps Omar had made at home. <a href="https://www.startribune.com/divided-left-field-of-minneapolis-mayoral-hopefuls-have-unified-message-don-t-rank-frey/600107813/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For instance, she didn’t back</a> Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s reelection bid in part because he <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/rep-omar-endorses-2-frey-opponents-for-minneapolis-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t support the amendment change</a> to replace the city’s police department. Frey, in turn, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-jacob-frey-other-west-metro-mayors-endorse-don-samuels-over-rep-ilhan-omar/600195677/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Omar’s main primary opponent</a>, former Minneapolis City Council and school board member Don Samuels.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No relation to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> There’s not a ton of recent polling on Frey, but a <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/minneapolis-voters-split-on-frey-unfavorable-view-of-city-council/89-9a1c639f-8072-4c4d-a85b-50cee01d8465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September survey suggests</a> that a majority of the city’s Black voters view him in a favorable light. “I think that having the incumbent mayor against you may have divided Omar’s coalition,” Minta said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Samuels also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ilhan-omar-faces-primary-challenger-hopes-find-weakness/story?id=88147930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly criticized</a> Omar for her support of replacing the city’s police department with a Department of Public Safety, a bid <a href="https://vote.minneapolismn.gov/results-data/election-results/2021/ballot-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which ultimately failed</a> by roughly 12 points in November. Minta told me that Omar’s support for this ballot measure could have angered Black and white voters who didn’t want to disband the police department but wanted to reform it instead. On top of that, Omar has continued to call <a href="https://ilhanomar.com/issue/criminal-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for police reform</a>, which puts her at odds with other Democrats in the area who have moved away from calling for sweeping police reform in the years after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Floyd’s murder in police custody</a>. Frey, for example, once promised to reform and rebuild the city’s police department <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-freys-credibility-on-police-battered-by-false-claims-about-reform/600148638/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but later retreated</a> from this pledge. Samuels, meanwhile, attempted to make the race against Omar a referendum on that November vote <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/15/minnesota-policing-ilhan-omar-reelection-don-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by touting his past support</a> for more resources and better training for police officers versus annihilating the department completely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some Black activists in the past have argued that Omar is out of touch with the community, particularly as it relates to ‘defund the police,’” Minta said. “There was also an uptick in crime in some of the urban areas in and around the city around the time when this proposal was going around, and many people still wanted police on the streets to fight crime. As a result, the more progressive messaging on policing was not in sync with some of the city resident’s demands.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may also be the case, though, that Omar just <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/09/ilhan-omar-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t take her primary challenge too seriously</a>. For instance, Omar and Samuels didn’t debate, and despite amassing a sizable war chest of her own — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/us/politics/ilhan-omar-faces-a-primary-challenge-in-her-minnesota-house-district.html" target="_blank">over $2.3 million</a> — Omar didn’t air any TV campaign ads against him. Samuels was also perhaps a surprisingly strong primary opponent. He had his own name recognition in the community as a longtime resident and activist of north Minneapolis and a former city council and school board member. He also <a href="https://www.startribune.com/samuels-outraises-omar-as-august-dfl-primary-approaches-according-to-new-campaign-finance-reports/600191471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a lot of money</a> — though <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/MN/05/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimately less</a> than Omar — which boosted his overall campaign and had the backing of a number of establishment Democrats in the area, plus <a href="https://www.startribune.com/samuels-over-omar-in-dfl-primary/600194820/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the endorsement</a> of Minneapolis’s big newspaper, the Star Tribune, which put Omar in a tough spot even though she was the incumbent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Omar’s struggles at home don’t fully explain what happened last Tuesday or why Omar has faced a primary challenge each time she has sought reelection. Remember, she’s the only member of the Squad to face back-to-back challenges while other outspoken members, like Ocasio-Cortez, have run unopposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That brings us back to Omar’s identity. “She has these various identities that make her really susceptible to being targeted because she’s so visible,” said <a href="https://polisci.msu.edu/people/directory/lajevardi-nazita.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazita Lajevardi</a>, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies political behavior as well as race and ethnic politics. “She’s a woman, first and foremost; she’s Black; she’s veiled, and she’s an immigrant. These four things are in a sense competing for how she can be really attacked, and they make her particularly vulnerable.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Lajevardi told me that Omar’s identity is likely one reason why so many Democrats feel emboldened to challenge her. Omar’s image has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/02/poster-linking-rep-ilhan-omar-sparks-outrage-injuries-wva-state-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used by Republicans</a> as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/lauren-boebert-calls-rep-ilhan-203009186.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sort of bogey(wo)man</a> since she first won in 2018, and that, Lajevardi said, could buoy Democrats who want to similarly knock her down. It hasn’t helped, Lajevardi added, that establishment Democrats, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/10/ilhan-omar-democrats-harassment-silencing-israel-hamas-taliban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, have also <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/world/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-admonishes-freshman-rep-ilhan-omar-over-israel-tweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly admonished Omar</a>, which could also embolden moderate Democrats with similar views, like Samuels.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While it’s true that Omar’s criticism of Israel may go too far for many Democrats, Lajevardi stressed that as an immigrant woman, Omar’s comments on Israel might be interpreted differently than if they came from someone who was white or born in the United States. “Nativity is super important here because people seem to think that if she questions how the United States might be responsible for any sort of harm or violence abroad, then perhaps that means she’s not loyal to the United States,” Lajevardi said. “When she’s critical of Israel, people aren’t just listening to arguments of somebody being critical of Israel, but the image of her — her body politics and identity — matters, too, in shaping how that message is received.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Omar’s an easy target in a way that other Squad members just aren’t. She is a disruptive representative because of who she is and what ideas she represents. And because she built a coalition with the progressive arm of the Democratic Party, which has an uneasy relationship with the rest of the party, she is an easy scapegoat for both establishment Democrats and Republicans. “So will she get another challenge in 2024? Seems likely,” Minta said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Aug. 16, 1:37 p.m.):</strong> This story has been updated to explain that although no debate took place between Omar and Samuels, Omar’s campaign says she did not decline to debate him.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the past week, Democrats’ odds of keeping control of the Senate after the midterms have ticked up to around 60 percent, according to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deluxe forecast model</a>. In this installment of “Model Talk” on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Nate Silver and Galen Druke discuss the news events and polling that have contributed to this change. They also ask whether there is reason to expect the current environment to hold as we get closer to Election Day and whether we should be skeptical of the polls showing Democrats performing well in parts of the Midwest where polls have repeatedly underestimated Republicans.</p>
