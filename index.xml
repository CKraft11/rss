<p data-paragraph="main">Election Day is finally upon us, and we’re “right back where we started from,” to borrow a phrase from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckCwBAhz4oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxine Nightingale</a>. FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deluxe forecast for the U.S. House</a>, which is now final and no longer updating, estimates that Republicans have an 84-in-100 chance of taking control of the chamber. That’s roughly the same chance Republicans had when we launched our midterm forecast on June 30.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2316" height="1380" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.21.18-AM-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.21.18-AM-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.21.18-AM-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.21.18-AM-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The 87-in-100 chance that Republicans had back in June was consistent with not only the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> but also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical precedent</a>. The president’s party has lost an average of 26 House seats in midterm elections since the end of World War II. <br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn Roe v. Wade</a>, the national mood seemed to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-environment-might-be-improving-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shift in the Democrats’ favor</a>. Democrats retook the lead in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> polls (which ask Americans to pick the party they plan to support for Congress without asking about specific candidates). And their chances of keeping the House in our forecast rose as high as 32-in-100 — enough to make Republicans sweat.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2396" height="1342" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.22.39-AM-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Then in October, the national political mood <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned back against the president’s party</a>, as it usually does in the final month of a midterm campaign. As a result, our final average of generic congressional ballot polls shows Republicans getting 46.9 percent support nationally and Democrats getting 45.7 percent. Still, that is not as big of a lead as the opposition party enjoyed in the 2010 and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 midterms</a>. Democrats’ summer surge may have saved them from their doomsday scenario — a so-called “red wave” election.<br><br>Our forecast also predicts that, on average, Republicans will win 230 seats in the next House, and Democrats will win 205. That would be a 17-seat gain for Republicans, which would be below average for a midterm election. However, those seat projections come with very wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confidence intervals</a>, which means <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide range of scenarios is possible</a>. For example, our forecast says there’s an 80 percent chance that Republicans will gain between one and 33 House seats.</p>

Democrats currently have <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine more House seats</a> than Republicans,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counting vacant seats toward the party that most recently held them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> which means the GOP needs a net gain of five seats. And they have plenty of opportunities to pick up seats. Here is a list of every House seat that Republicans have a greater than 25 percent chance to pick up,<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counting both Democratic-held seats and new seats created by redistricting that don’t have an incumbent party.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have a greater than 90-in-100 chance of capturing 10 of these seats, primarily because <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional redistricting</a> made these seats easy targets for the party. For example, Republican mapmakers redrew the Georgia 6th and Tennessee 5th districts to be 25 and 32 percentage points redder, respectively. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida’s new congressional map</a> converted three Democratic-held districts — the 5th,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida’s new 4th District constitutes much of the state’s former 5th District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> 7th and 13th — into Republican strongholds. Population growth also led to the creation of four new districts (the Colorado 8th, Florida 15th, Montana 1st and Texas 38th) that will probably go red.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-favored-final-midterm-forecasts-fivethirtyeight-92819264</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">There are also a lot of open seats on this list where Democratic incumbents aren’t running for reelection. The electoral advantage of incumbency <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/681670?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t what it once was</a>, but it can <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still matter in a close race</a>. So <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-democrats-are-leaving-the-house-and-that-could-help-republicans-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Democrats retiring from the House than Republicans</a> is another boon to the GOP. For example, Democrats are in danger of losing the Wisconsin 3rd without moderate Rep. Ron Kind, and the Rhode Island 2nd likely wouldn’t even be competitive if Rep. Jim Langevin were running again. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, several Democratic incumbents are vulnerable too, especially those in districts <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/trump-district-democrats-could-become-extinct-in-the-house-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried by former President Donald Trump</a> in the 2020 election. Reps. Tom O’Halleran, Cindy Axne and Mary Peltola may struggle to find enough crossover voters to survive. Reps. Matt Cartwright and Jared Golden are in a better position but are not out of the woods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In total, there are 19 non-Republican-held House seats where Republicans have better odds of winning than Democrats,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some are essentially toss-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> including six where Republicans have at least a 97-in-100 chance of winning. So why are Republicans’ chances of winning the House only 84-in-100? Well, because Democrats could also flip some seats from red to blue. Here is a list of every House seat that <em>Democrats</em> have a greater than 25 percent chance to pick up,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counting both Republican-held seats and new seats created by redistricting that don’t have an incumbent party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast.</p>

 <p>*Two incumbents are running in the Texas 34th: Republican Mayra Flores and Democrat Vicente Gonzalez. However, because Gonzalez currently represents the next-door 15th District, Flores is listed as the incumbent.</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting also helped Democrats a bit in the House. The North Carolina 14th, Oregon 6th and Texas 35th are new districts created by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reapportionment</a>. And Democratic mapmakers reconfigured the Republican-held Illinois 13th to elect a Democrat. And then, there are a couple of Republican incumbents whose seats are now blue enough that they should watch their back: For instance, President Biden won California’s new 22nd and 27th by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double digits</a>. Overall, though, Democrats have fewer opportunities to add members than Republicans do, which essentially tells the story of this election.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">What’s that? Do you still insist on staying up late on Tuesday to follow the results, just in case something unexpected happens? In that case, I have two recommendations. The first is to pay particular attention to the 25 House districts below. According to our forecast, they are the 25 most likely <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-tipping-point-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“tipping-point” seats</a>, or the seats most likely to decide control of the chamber. As these seats go, so goes the House.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">With all the hubbub over the horse race, it might have been easy to forget that there are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 governors’ races</a> taking place tonight, too. But the results of these contests may have a greater impact on everyday Americans’ day-to-day lives than congressional races as state chief executives have an outsized influence on state-level policy issues like health care, education, tax policy and more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since 2010, Republicans have held a majority of governorships. In fact, the GOP currently holds 28 governor’s seats, while the Democrats control 22. That said, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a>, which is now frozen, indicates that Republicans and Democrats are each poised for a few pickups.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s run through some of the main trends and states that we’ll be watching — starting with the most contentious seats, and ending with the least suspenseful races. Shall we begin?</p>



<h2><strong>There are a bunch of competitive races …</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ll start with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kansas</strong></a>, where the Democratic incumbent has an edge. Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, is running for another term in office, but only has a 62-in-100 chance of winning against Republican Derek Schmidt. Unlike a few other races we’ll cover further down, though, the competitiveness of this contest isn’t <em>that </em>mysterious: <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas is just a red state</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-favored-final-midterm-forecasts-fivethirtyeight-92819264</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Our model still leans toward Kelly, though, in part, because she’s a relatively popular incumbent. <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/kansas-2022-governor-laura-kelly-holds-three-point-lead-over-ag-derek-schmidt-in-gubernatorial-election-senator-moran-leads-by-21-points-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One recent survey</a> pegged her favorability at 53 percent among Kansas voters — 20 percentage points above President Biden’s. On top of that, Kelly has <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article268176872.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked to appeal to a broad swath</a> of voters by promoting issues that are important to Kansas Republicans, like education and the economy, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-kansass-democratic-governor-isnt-talking-about-abortion-but-her-gop-opponent-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than</a> focusing on more polarizing topics like abortion. If Schmidt is able to overcome Kelly’s incumbency and popularity advantage, it’ll likely be both due to the <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Kansas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state’s past voting history</a>, coupled with the fact that Schmidt (who is <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/kansas-governor-race-laura-kelly-derek-schmidt-election-what-to-know-results/41822237#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by former President Donald Trump</a>) took more conservative stances in a midterm year where there’s deep dissatisfaction with Democrats at the national level. In short, a favorable midterm environment might be enough to pull him over the finish line.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-711-KS-2-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-711-KS-2-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-711-KS-2-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-711-KS-2-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1064" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-335-KS-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-335-KS-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-335-KS-2.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-governor-topline-335-KS-2.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Other competitive races in our forecast lean more toward Republicans, however. That’s the case, at least, for both <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Arizona</strong></a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Alaska</strong></a> (but other parties running in these states still stand a chance, too, so we won’t count them out). Both states currently have Republican governors, so it might not be all<em> that </em>surprising that our metrics suggest that the GOP will remain in control.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Arizona, Republican Kari Lake has a 68-in-100 chance of winning. As I mentioned at the top, governors wield a lot of power in their respective states, so it might be striking to some of our readers that Lake — who has been <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/16/arizona-kari-lake-midterm-election-denial-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the leading proponents</a> of the baseless idea that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump — has an edge over Democrat Katie Hobbs. A couple of factors could be contributing to that,<strong> </strong>though, such as the fact that Lake <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/politics/kari-lake-arizona-governor-swing-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/16/kari-lake-arizona-election-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the news</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/arizona-kari-lake-false-fraud-claims-2020-election-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot lately</a> and enjoys high name recognition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/us/politics/kari-lake-az-journalist-gop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to over two decades</a> as a local TV newscaster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><br>Of course, Hobbs <em>could</em> pull ahead. While she’s still an underdog, at least by our metrics, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-kelly-opinion-poll-arizona-senate-economy-abortion-immigration-2022-10-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one September-October survey</a> showed that just over half the state’s registered voters (51 percent) classified Lake’s views as “extreme.” And, as my colleagues and I discussed last month, it’s also entirely possible that our forecast for this seat is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-tried-to-outguess-the-fivethirtyeight-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too good for Republicans</a> — meaning the race is closer than it appears.</p>

Mike Dunleavy in Alaska has a larger edge: an 87-in-100 chance of winning. On Tuesday, the incumbent will share a ballot with independent Bill Walker, Democrat Les Gara and Republican Charlie Pierce. Alaska’s new <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting system</a>, however, makes this race slightly harder to gauge. Under the system — which was first deployed during <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an August congressional special election won</a> by Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola — voters are given the choice to rank who they want to fill a particular seat. And in recent months, Walker and Gara’s teams <a href="https://www.newsminer.com/news/politics/bill-walker-les-gara-campaigns-team-up-to-compete-for-second-choice-votes/article_9101cbea-5969-11ed-8514-7fd00772b5ad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have paired up to</a> both encourage Pierce to <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/10/26/walker-and-gara-call-on-pierce-to-drop-out-of-governors-race-dunleavy-says-hes-waiting-for-more-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop out of the race</a> and to <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2022/10/20/dunleavy-defends-record-against-gara-and-walker-attacks-in-rapid-fire-alaska-debate-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally against Dunleavy</a>, telling voters that they were relying on the other’s second-place votes to win. If the gambit works, it could have an outsized influence on the race: Together, Walker and Gara made up more than <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22PRIM/ElectionSummaryReportRPT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent of the primary election vote</a>. Still, with Dunleavy <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading by significant margins</a> in recent polls, it makes sense why our model still favors a Republican victory here.</p>

In fact, there are at least three seats in which Democrats are at risk of losing control of the governorship in their respective states. <br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nevada</strong></a>, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively popular</a> Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak is nevertheless in danger of losing his reelection bid to Republican Joe Lombardo. As of Tuesday morning, our forecast gives the Republican a 61-in-100 chance of winning. Lombardo, who has <a href="https://thenevadaglobe.com/fl/heller-and-lombardo-rise-to-the-top-of-the-polls-with-republican-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to balance</a> the demands of his party’s more moderate and extremist wings, has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led by single digits in most recent polls</a>. This contest will be one to keep a close eye on as it could push the state firmly to the right <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/state-government-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if Republicans also win control of the state legislature</a> (which is possible, but unlikely). To aid their party, however, Democratic heavyweights like former President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/11/02/obama-stumps-democrats-catherine-cortez-masto-governor-steve-sisolak-las-vegas-election-2022/8240376001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have visited Nevada</a>, arguing that “democracy is on the ballot.” But in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-nevada-polls-are-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transient state like Nevada</a>, where the share of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/nevada-midterms-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered Democrats has decreased</a>, it’s very possible that Republicans will perform well here in a favorable midterm year. Plus, Nevada <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t reliably blue</a>: Biden only won the state by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little over 2 percentage points</a> in 2020.</p>

Tony Evers must contend with both <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/analysis/2022/05/26/wisconsin-governor-tony-evers-trying-get-past-joe-biden-low-ratings/9927472002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s unpopularity</a> in the state and his <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/madison/politics/2022/09/19/how-favorably-do-wisconsinites-find-the-candidates-on-their-ballot-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own lackluster approval ratings</a>. Our forecast looks at this race as essentially a pure toss-up between Evers and Republican Tim Michels, who currently has a 53-in-100 chance of unseating the incumbent. Perhaps ominously for Democrats, though, the state’s gubernatorial races have historically gone with the midterm flow: Republicans won them in 2010 and 2014, and Democrats won in 2006 and 2018.</p>

Democratic Gov. Kate Brown <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/08/gov-kate-brown-who-cant-seek-re-election-in-2022-keeps-raising-and-spending-campaign-cash-anyway.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not eligible to run for reelection</a>, but <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/11/whitmers-approval-ticks-up-in-michigan-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her lowest-in-the-nation approval rating</a> (according to a Morning Consult report published in October) could weigh down the Democrat trying to succeed her. Republican Christine Drazan has a narrow 37-in-100 chance of beating Democrat Tina Kotek, who would become the country’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/meet-oregons-tina-kotek-hopes-americas-first-lesbian-governor-rcna30628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first openly lesbian governor</a> (a milestone she’d share with Massachusetts Democrat Maura Healey if both are victorious). And going into Election Day, Kotek has a slight edge: a 63-in-100 chance of winning. That said, this race might prove difficult for the party currently in power because Oregon isn’t a deep-blue state: Former President George W.

<p data-paragraph="main">What’s working in Kotek’s favor is that Oregon has consistently elected Democrats to the governorship <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/oregon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the late 1980s</a>. The flip side, however, is that the Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have only won recent gubernatorial races here</a> by single-digit margins (Republicans lost by just <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&amp;year=2010&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.5 points in 2010</a>, <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&amp;year=2014&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.8 points in 2014</a> and <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&amp;year=2018&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6.4 points</a> in 2018). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another interesting wrinkle in this race is the presence of a formidable third-party candidate on the ticket, independent Betsy Johnson. According to our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>, Johnson has consistently netted high single-digit support — which is interesting considering the fact that few statewide races involve a truly competitive third wheel. What could work to her benefit, too, is that she’s tried to position herself more toward the middle, dinging Drazan <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/elections/drazan-pro-life-woman-aware-of-oregon-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for her anti-abortion views</a> and Kotek for trying to make Oregon “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/15/politics/oregon-governor-election-kotek-drazan-johnson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woke and broke</a>.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, while partisanship has increased over the years <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/split-ticket-voting-hit-a-new-low-in-2018-senate-and-governor-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in gubernatorial races</a>, voting history still matters. And for years, there have been a handful of states where both parties have tried — and failed — at winning seats from the opposing party. A few of those are on the ballot this year, and it doesn’t look like old patterns are likely to be broken.<br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></a>, for example, Democrat Josh Shapiro is clearly favored to win (he has a 97-in-100 chance to beat Republican Doug Mastriano). While Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2010/results/pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held the governorship there in 2010</a>, they’ve been unable to beat back Democrats in both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/pennsylvania-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/pennsylvania/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>, and things look bad for them in 2022.

Part of the reason why this contest isn’t more squarely in Grisham’s column is that voters in the state <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2022/10/10/poll-lujan-grisham-approval-rating-at-46-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fairly lukewarm about her job performance</a>.

<p data-paragraph="main">There are the two Republican-held governorships that will likely go to Democrats: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Massachusetts</strong></a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Maryland</strong></a>. Last year, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/01/massachusetts-charlie-baker-reelection-523597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that he wouldn’t seek reelection. But Baker, a moderate Republican who <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/13/charlie-baker-massachusetts-trump-339182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defied Trump</a> during his two terms in office, likely won’t be replaced by a member of his own party — despite Massachusetts voters <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electing GOP gubernatorial candidates</a> in both 2014 and 2018. <br></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Democrat Maura Healey has over a 99-in-100 chance of beating Republican Geoff Diehl. This is likely due to the fact that <a href="https://www.270towin.com/states/Massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massachusetts is a very blue state</a>, and without a candidate who shares Baker’s moderatism, Republicans were always going to be underdogs. (Diehl, a former state House member, is <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/10/06/donald-trump-geoff-diehl-massachusetts-charlie-baker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/politics/trump-republicans-midterm-election-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t committed to accepting</a> the outcome of the November election.) If Healey wins, she (along with Kotek in Oregon), could make history as the country’s first <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/us-never-lesbian-governor-two-women-change-rcna52300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out lesbian</a> governor(s).</p>

Throughout the race, Moore has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/08/31/moore-cox-fundraising-maryland-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven a prolific fundraiser</a> and has led Cox by 30-point margins <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in every poll</a> in our database fielded since September. Similar to Massachusetts, this seat is most likely to flip because the state’s more moderate incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan is term-limited <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/28/maryland-general-election-ballot-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and can’t seek reelection</a>. And Cox, like Diehl, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/politics/dan-cox-maryland-governors-race.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a Trump loyalist</a> who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/20/maryland-mail-vote-counting-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has denied, without evidence</a>, the legitimacy of the 2020 election. That likely won’t bode well with the state’s voters, who elected Biden by a nearly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/maryland-president-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33-point margin</a> in 2020. If Moore wins, <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/decision-2022/wes-moore-black-democrats-aiming-to-make-maryland-history/3194744/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would make history</a>, too, as the state’s first Black governor.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Just about no part of the 2022 midterms is more uncertain than the race for control of the U.S. Senate. The chamber is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans,<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including two independents — Maine Sen. Angus King and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — who caucus with the 48 Democratic senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> but Democrats hold a precarious majority via the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. As a result, a one-seat gain by Republicans would be enough to give them control, whereas Democrats need to avoid any net losses to retain their advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the fate of the Senate looks to be on a knife’s edge. Republicans have a 59-in-100 chance of taking control of the chamber, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, which is now frozen. That isn’t much better than the probability of calling a coin-flip correctly, although the GOP may have the slightest of edges. Considering the midterm environment and the seats that are up this cycle, it’s perhaps unsurprising that Republicans have a slightly better chance than Democrats of capturing the Senate. But the GOP’s fortunes have also improved markedly in the final weeks, as Democrats had about a 7-in-10 shot of controlling the Senate in late September. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2418" height="1374" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-08-at-1.03.52-AM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Still, if one party does have an edge, it’s the GOP. Our forecast, which has trended toward Republicans in the final few weeks of the campaign, gives them an 80 percent chance of holding between 48 and 54 seats after this election. Our forecast predicts that, on average, Republicans will wind up with 50.9 seats — essentially 51, which would be just enough for outright control of the chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if we look individually at the 35 Senate contests on the ballot,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 100-seat Senate is divided into three classes of seats that have staggered six-year terms. There are 33 seats each in &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_I.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_II.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class II&lt;/a&gt;, and 34 seats in &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_III.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Class III&lt;/a&gt;, and only one of the classes is on the ballot every two years. Class III seats are up for election this year, but there is also a special election in Oklahoma for the Class II seat held by Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-special-elections-oklahoma-jim-inhofe-congress-adc9a3344b4cc339f395859913a98e79" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;resigning at the end&lt;/a&gt; of the current (117th) Congress. This makes for a total of 35 Senate elections in 2022 that will affect the makeup of the 118th Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> we can also see how Republicans are somewhat better positioned than Democrats. That’s because the GOP needs fewer things to go right on Election Day, whereas Democrats have less room for error.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This GOP advantage is most obvious in the Senate’s five most competitive seats, four of which are being defended by Democrats. To hold the Senate, Democrats at a minimum must retain all four seats they currently control, or retain three of the four <em>and </em>pick up the one seat in this group that Republicans are defending. Of the four seats Democrats are defending, one leans toward the GOP, one is a toss-up and two narrowly lean Democratic, while the GOP-held seat is also a toss-up.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And for the most part, these are among the races most likely to decide control of the Senate — that is, be the “tipping-point” contest. In light of this, the most important matchup may be in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a>. Using the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive version of the forecast,</a> giving Georgia to either party raises its chances of winning the Senate to about 3 in 4, without knowing outcomes anywhere else. The good news for the GOP is that it may have the upper hand here, as Republican Herschel Walker has a 63-in-100 chance of defeating Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. Walker’s chances have improved despite allegations that he encouraged and/or paid for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple women</a> to have abortions while campaigning on a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/walker-warnock-georgia-abortion-00061971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly anti-abortion platform</a>. But Walker, like most other Republican candidates, may be benefiting from the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more favorable Republican national environment</a>. Notably, this race is so close <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-if-georgias-senate-race-goes-to-a-runoff-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that there’s about a 1-in-5 chance</a> it will go to a <a href="https://www.sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/2022%20State%20Scheduled%20Elections%20Short%20Calendar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dec. 6 runoff</a>, should neither candidate win an outright majority (there’s also a Libertarian on the ballot).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans’ other top pick-up opportunity is in Nevada, but that race could be a squeaker: Republican Adam Laxalt has a 51-in-100 chance of defeating Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to our forecast</a>, which suggests neither candidate really has an advantage. Still, Laxalt has about a 1-point lead in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a>, although neither candidate <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has had an advantage</a> much beyond that margin since late September. Cortez Masto will hope that the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-nevada-presidential-election-2020-catherine-cortez-masto-522d32cfa13a1a1f9a639ee6d9707e8a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaunted electoral organization</a> built by her predecessor, the late Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, can turn out Democratic voters, but Laxalt may come out on top <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-the-senate-could-rest-on-abortion-and-inflation-in-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to frustration over inflation and the economy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other toss-up race is in Pennsylvania, but Republicans here are on the defensive following <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-all-those-gop-retirements-mean-for-the-2022-senate-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the retirement</a> of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. This seat is of critical importance, too, as our forecast interactive shows that Oz winning would give Republicans better than a 4-in-5 shot of capturing the Senate, while Democrats’ chances would improve to around 7 in 10 with a win here. Appropriately, the race is just about too close to call: Republican Mehmet Oz, a physician and TV personality, has a 57-in-100 chance of defeating Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. This race has been trending toward Oz, though, as Fetterman’s roughly 3-point lead two weeks ago has narrowed to practically a tie in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our polling average</a>. Fetterman suffered a stroke in the spring, and coverage of its effects on his health and his ability to serve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-fettermans-attacks-on-health-disability-and-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been a major focus of the race</a>, but Oz has had to make up ground in this campaign because <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2022/11_2_2022_tables.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters tend</a> to view <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Marist-Poll_PA-NOS-and-Tables_202211030901-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">him more</a> unfavorably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/31/upshot/senate-polls-az-ga-nv-pa-crosstabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than Fetterman</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The two other highly competitive seats narrowly favor Democrats. In Arizona, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a> gives Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly a 66-in-100 chance of defeating Republican Blake Masters. But while Kelly may narrowly best Masters thanks to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/10/arizonas-u-s-senate-race-shifts-to-a-toss-up-as-polls-tighten-despite-massive-democratic-fundraising-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his huge spending edge</a>, the incumbent may also thank his personal appeal: Likely Arizona voters told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/31/upshot/senate-polls-az-ga-nv-pa-crosstabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena College/The New York Times</a> in late October that they preferred GOP control to Democratic control of the Senate, but also that they preferred Kelly over Masters. In New Hampshire, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a> gives Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan a 72-in-100 chance of beating Republican Don Bolduc, a retired Army general whom popular New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (a fellow Republican) <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-08-19/sununu-says-he-wont-endorse-conspiracy-theory-type-bolduc-in-senate-republican-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labeled</a> a “conspiracy-theory type” candidate during the GOP primary (Sununu <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/chris-sununu-don-bolduc-election-falsehoods-cnntv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has since backed</a> Bolduc, however).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Five other races look more likely to go for one party or the other — three in seats held by Republicans and two in seats held by Democrats — but they could also be in play depending on how the night goes for each party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, one of the country’s leading swing states, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is favored to defeat Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. Historically, incumbents from the party not in the White House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/ron-johnson-republicans-senate-2022-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost never lose</a> in midterms, so Johnson has likely benefited from the political environment. Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sometimes-senators-just-retire-dont-read-too-much-into-the-recent-gop-exodus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are defending two open seats</a> in North Carolina and Ohio, but they also look like good bets to win each race. In red-leaning <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, GOP Rep. Ted Budd <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/cheri-beasley-democrats-losing-streak-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks to have the upper hand</a> over Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. And while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> has looked competitive <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for much of this cycle</a>, Republican J.D. Vance looks likely to defeat Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, as Vance has consolidated support among Republicans in a state that is redder than North Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite their states’ blue leans, Democratic incumbents in Colorado and Washington could also face danger if things go well for the GOP. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington</a>, five-term Democratic Sen. Patty Murray is favored over Republican Tiffany Smiley, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/WA/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has almost kept pace with Murray in fundraising</a>. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a>, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet looks likely to defeat Republican Joe O’Dea. But Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-a-republican-win-colorados-senate-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hoped O’Dea could surprise here</a> thanks to his business background and moderate profile based on his opposition to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although Republicans should win both contests, two other races are of interest thanks to the unusual nature of their elections: Alaska and Utah. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Under Alaska’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new electoral system</a>, which combines the nation’s first top-four primary with ranked choice voting in the general election, the Senate race has come down to two very different Republicans: Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka, a former commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Administration. Thanks to her moderate reputation, Murkowski <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/murkowski-alaska-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is positioned to win</a> many independent and most Democratic votes, even though Tshibaka, who has former <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/06/18/trump-gives-complete-and-total-endorsement-to-tshibaka-in-alaska-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Donald Trump’s endorsement</a>, will likely win most Republican votes. In red-leaning <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska</a>, that has made for a very tight race, with each candidate having about a 1-in-2 shot of victory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/utah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah</a> will feature a contest between Republican Sen. Mike Lee and independent Evan McMullin, who <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&amp;fips=49&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran for president in 2016</a> and won 21 percent in Utah as a conservative alternative to Trump. Lee is heavily favored to win, but McMullin did <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/4/23/23037939/mike-lee-evan-mcmullin-utah-democrat-party-convention-results-senate-election-kael-weston" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive the state Democratic Party’s endorsement</a> as part of <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2022/10/28/does-evan-mcmullin-have-a-chance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to build a coalition</a> of Trump-skeptical Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for the remaining 23 seats, our forecast views the 15 Republican-held seats as solidly Republican and the eight Democratic-held seats as solidly Democratic. On paper, a handful of these states — such as Florida, Iowa and Oregon — could be competitive under some circumstances, but those conditions have not come to pass in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All in all, close races in a few key states will likely decide which party has a majority. If Republicans make gains, that would <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely be in line with midterm history</a>: Dating back to World War II, the president’s party has lost seats in 13 of 19 midterms. But Democrats will hope they can add 2022 to the list of midterms in which the president’s party gained seats or at least avoided losses. And the stakes couldn’t be higher: Just one seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be the difference</a> between Republicans having full control of Congress and Democrats maintaining a foothold on Capitol Hill.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">When we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched our midterms forecast on June 30</a>, Republicans had a 53 percent chance of taking over the Senate from Democrats, and an 87 percent chance of taking over the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We could almost have turned our servers off and let that forecast stand. Today, in our final forecast of the cycle, Republicans have a 59 percent chance of winning the Senate and an 84 percent chance of winning the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before I dig deeper into this ostensible stability, a few words about the probabilistic nature of our forecast. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, let’s talk a bit more about that final GOP Senate number, 59 percent. It’s in an annoying zone as far as I’m concerned. If I met you on the street, I wouldn’t know how to describe the race. It’s on the brink between a toss-up and one that we say leans toward Republicans. And to make matters more confusing, that 59 percent figure comes from our Deluxe forecast, which includes the input of <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human expert forecasters like the Cook Political Report</a>. The Lite forecast (essentially a “polls only” version) and the Classic forecast (polls plus other objective indicators) have Republicans as just 50 and 51 percent “favorites,” respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I don’t want to blow off that 59 percent number. Deluxe is supposed to be the most accurate version of our model. To be blunt, 59 percent is enough of an edge that if you offered to let me bet on Republicans at even money, I’d take it. (If I bet on politics, that is. Which I don’t.) Still, Democrats holding the Senate, or the race coming down to a runoff in Georgia, would not be surprising in the least.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the House, meanwhile, you shouldn’t round the Republicans’ 84 percent chance up to 100 or the Democrats’ 16 percent chance down to zero. Two years ago, Republicans had just a 3 percent chance of winning the House in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final forecast</a> and yet came within five seats of doing so. The balance of the evidence suggests a national political environment that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-3-big-questions-i-still-have-about-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favors Republicans by only 2 to 3 percentage points</a>. And the polling itself, if anything, has been a little tighter than that. (Democrats have a 25 percent chance to keep the House in the polls-only Lite version of our forecast. After the redistricting process, Republicans have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less of an advantage</a> from gerrymandering and district boundaries than they did previously, so a roughly tied national environment would lead to a highly competitive race for the House — see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-3-big-questions-i-still-have-about-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday’s post</a> for much more detail on this.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republicans-favored-final-midterm-forecasts-fivethirtyeight-92819264</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">At the same time, the upside case for Republicans has perhaps been understated. Our model puts the 80th percentile range of outcomes in the House at between a <em>one</em>-seat and a 33-seat GOP gain; and remember, 20 percent of the time, the number will fall <em>outside</em> that range. Just as it isn’t that hard for the race in the House to become rather competitive, it also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t take much to turn it into a Republican landslide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, just because we’ll start the night with roughly 50-50 odds in the Senate does <em>not</em> necessarily mean we’ll finish the night with the balance of power determined by just one or two seats. Fairly often, all the competitive races break the same way in races for Congress. There’s almost a 25 percent chance that Republicans wind up with 53 or more seats, according to our Deluxe forecast (and a 7 percent chance that Democrats do so).</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I mentioned earlier, the topline probabilities in our House and Senate forecasts are very similar to what they were in June. But surely some individual races changed a lot, especially in the Senate? Nope, not that either. Take a look at Republican chances of winning in the 12 most competitive Senate races.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In every state, the numbers are nearly identical. Of course, that doesn’t mean the race was steady the whole time. Democrats had much clearer polling leads in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> during the late summer. They were even ahead in the polls in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/wisconsin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a>, and tied in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> — all states where they now trail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One plausible explanation is that Democrats initially benefited from a focus of attention on the Supreme Court’s decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, but then fell back to earth as the news cycle began to emphasize other topics such as immigration, inflation and crime.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that our June 30 model launch came &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Dobbs decision, but before there had been much time for it to work its way into the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> There is probably some truth to that, but I’d be careful about assuming the story is that simple. For one thing, the president’s party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically does worse in the polls the longer you go in the election cycle</a>. This time, though, Democrats are actually doing <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly better on the generic ballot</a> on the day of the election — trailing by 1.2 percentage points — than they were on June 23, the day before the Dobbs decision, when they trailed by 2.3 percentage points. That’s unusual historically and does suggest some lasting impact from Dobbs.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/election-deniers-favored-win-midterm-races-fivethirtyeight-92803581</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Also, while Democrats might have abortion working for them, they have a lot working against them, including inflation (polling shifts have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/18/gas-prices-election-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly correlated with changes in gas prices</a>) an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unpopular president</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/migrant-border-crossings-fiscal-year-2022-topped-276-million-breaking-rcna53517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record numbers of migrants</a> at the Mexican border and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very long history of poor performance for the president’s party at the midterms</a>. If the polls are <em>exactly</em> right — they won’t be, but let’s play along — and Republicans win only 15 House seats or so while the Senate comes down to another runoff in Georgia — that would be a pretty good night for Democrats relative to historic norms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that is one reason to expect the polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-republican-sweep-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might <em>not</em> be right</a> and could be biased against Republicans again. And yet, the Democrats’ summer boomlet was real, realized not just in the polls but also in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of ballot initiatives and special-election outcomes</a>. If you don’t trust the polls, should you default to the fundamentals or to actual election results, like the upset wins Democrats had in races from Alaska to New York? You can <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-democratic-surprise-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a decent case either way</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact is that American voters are under a lot of conflicting pressures. They care about the Supreme Court, the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and Republican extremism, but they also care about inflation, crime and immigration, issues that have historically had a large influence on elections. Meanwhile, partisanship is high and tends to swamp all other factors; incumbency and candidate quality matter less than they used to. In any event, those various forces of political gravity have put us roughly back in the same place as we were in June.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">One final word: While we’ve tried to prepare you for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three basic scenarios</a> — polls roughly correct, polls biased against Republicans, polls biased against Democrats — those aren’t the only uncertainties in play. Although polling and forecast errors are correlated from race to race in midterms, they aren’t correlated <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much as they are in presidential races</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In one of the practice runs I did for the ABC News TV set — please tune in tonight! — the producers tried to throw us for a loop by having Don Bolduc, the Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire, win his race but Sen. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent in Georgia, wins his race without a runoff. Sounds impossible, right? Well, it’s not <em>that</em> crazy: such an outcome occurs about 5 percent of the time in our simulations. And while there’s been a lot of focus on Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada, some state <em>other</em> than those three is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping-point_state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tipping point state</a> in our simulations 56 percent of the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the election is close, it could take a long time to obtain certainty about who controls Congress, whether because of the Georgia runoff, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long time it takes to count ballots in some states</a>, legal challenges, or <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates refusing to accept the results</a>. A lot of coverage has focused on these concerns as they relate to 2024, but frankly I’m worried about what a razor-thin result would mean <em>this</em> year, too. We’ve appreciated your following our election coverage this year, and we’ll do the best we can to cover a potentially long and messy aftermath.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">With less than 24 hours to go until we <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1588213427461390337?s=20&amp;t=ouRzHDSGLpdb8mdtVUq4fg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freeze our model</a>,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll freeze it at midnight Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> we’re probably not going to see a lot more changes in the topline forecast. Republicans have a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent chance</a> of winning the Senate and an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">83 percent chance</a> in the House, according to our Deluxe forecast. Those numbers have been relatively steady for the past few days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s instead ask three big <em>forecasting</em> questions about the race. These aren’t questions like “how much will abortion matter,” which I hope we’re doing a good job of addressing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-the-senate-could-rest-on-abortion-and-inflation-in-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elsewhere at FiveThirtyEight</a>. Instead, they’re questions that will inform our understanding of future elections from an analytical, polling and forecasting standpoint.</p>



<h2><strong>Question 1: Will the polls be systematically wrong?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered this topic so often</a> that you might think I have nothing more to say about it — but you’d be wrong!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s partly because it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really is the whole ballgame</a>, at least when it comes to which party keeps control of the Senate. If Republicans beat their polling averages by, say, 3 percentage points across the board, it would be very unlikely for Democrats to salvage the Senate even if there’s some state-to-state variation. (Perhaps they could hold on in Arizona and New Hampshire, but they’d be considerable underdogs in Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania, where they need to win two out of the three.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, if <em>Democrats</em> beat their polls by 3 points across the board, the picture is very rosy for them. In that event, they’d be favorites in Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Arizona and New Hampshire would probably be out of reach for Republicans. But conversely, Ohio, North Carolina and Wisconsin would be <em>in</em> reach for Democrats. The House would also be highly competitive in this circumstance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which type of polling error is more likely? If you’ve been following these election updates, you’ve probably noticed me <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrestling back and forth</a> between a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-democratic-surprise-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“trust the process” mentality</a>, where I take the FiveThirtyEight’s model’s output as gospel, and a concern that the model may still be underestimating the chance of a pro-Democratic bias in the polls as we saw in 2016 and 2020.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/parties-making-final-pitches-voters-fivethirtyeight-politics-92670196</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">For what it’s worth, I’ve <em>mostly</em> landed on “trust the process.” My personal view of the race is pretty well aligned with the FiveThirtyEight Deluxe model. The polls could very well be biased against Republicans again. The best reason to think so is probably <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-republican-sweep-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “Nathan Redd” argument</a> that as polling gets more difficult, you should put more faith in the fundamentals. Usually, the president’s party has a rough midterm, especially when the president has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42 percent approval rating</a> and inflation is at <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.2 percent</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not hard to imagine how the polls could be biased <em>against</em> Democrats instead. After 2016 and 2020, pollsters <a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/719276/why-it-matters-if-the-polls-miss-again/?unlock=G312XOQO4PT6RXHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face more reputational risk from again missing high on Democrats than the other way around</a>, and that could consciously or unconsciously affect decisions they make at the margin, or even <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which polls they release to the public</a>. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/upshot/polling-averages-midterm-election.html?te=1&amp;nl=the-tilt&amp;emc=edit_nc_20221106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">composition of polling averages has considerably changed</a>, with fewer “gold standard” polls and more quick-and-dirty ones that tend to show more favorable results for Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’m not sympathetic to Democratic complaints <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/biden-gap-senate-surveys-00064362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about Republican pollsters “flooding the zone.”</a> Not all polls with a Republican-leaning house effect actually have any formal affiliation with the GOP. Also, to the extent that polls do have a house effect — that is, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/calculating-house-effects-of-polling-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently leaning toward Democrats or Republicans</a> — our model adjusts for it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Besides, being the University of Chicago economics major that I am, I mostly trust the market to sort everything out. Firms with a Republican house effect will lose business and credibility in future election cycles if Democrats have a good night. Conversely, some traditional pollsters like Monmouth University <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreyvs/status/1588599446665056256?s=20&amp;t=iqbIPo1okDpxWpupdJuj2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t even publishing final horse race numbers</a> in the races that they’re polling. If GOP-leaning firms like Trafalgar or InsiderAdvantage are willing to put their credibility on the line and Monmouth isn’t, that tells you something.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, we’re a long way removed from the Golden Age of Polling circa 2006-2012 when “gold standard” pollsters (live-caller telephone polls with transparent methodologies) could be counted upon to set a reliable benchmark. Nobody in the polling or election forecasting community has any right to be all that confident about what will happen on Tuesday. That might make you want to give up and trust the vibes<em> </em>or insider sentiment about the race, which is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/why-republican-insiders-think-the-gop-is-poised-for-a-blowout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bearish for Democrats</a>. But the track record of vibes is that they’re somewhere between useless and worse-than-useless, like in 2016 when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insiders thought Hillary Clinton would have a cakewalk</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/governors-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-92674801</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also worth mentioning that the FiveThirtyEight Deluxe model is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-our-model-thinks-the-polls-might-be-biased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly more favorable for Republicans in the Senate than the polls-only version</a> of our forecast, which essentially means that it does predict a little bit of pro-Democratic bias in the polls, especially in some of the redder states such as Ohio. So by endorsing Deluxe’s view, I’m putting a pinky finger on the scale for the view that polls will again have a Democratic bias, while also being open to a mere severe bias in either direction.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I do think this is a big year for the pollsters. In 2016, the polling error <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t really all that bad</a>, and pollsters had a semi-decent array of excuses from shifts in voter coalitions that made it important to weight polls by educational attainment to a crazy <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October and November news cycle, including the Comey letter</a>. In 2020, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 presented real challenges for polling</a>. This year, there aren’t as many contingencies. Most Americans have given up on COVID-19 precautions, there have been no late-breaking news events with obvious electoral implications, and Donald Trump isn’t on the ballot. </p>



<h2><strong>Question 2: How big will the turnout gap be?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"> I’m sorry to repeat the biggest cliche in election analysis, but if the polls are roughly in the right vicinity, control of the Senate will come down to turnout. If you care about the outcome and haven’t voted, you should do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On that front, Democrats got good news on Sunday with two major network polls showing a relatively small turnout gap. (I’ll use the terms “turnout gap” and “enthusiasm gap” interchangeably here; in both cases, I refer to the difference in margin between the likely voter and registered voter version of a poll.) The <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-discontent-fuels-gop-hopes-midterms-draw-close/story?id=92679694&amp;mc_cid=9b9e5c0c66&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a>, from our colleagues at ABC News and The Washington Post, showed Republicans 1 point ahead on the generic ballot among registered voters but 2 points ahead among likely voters, making for only a 1-point enthusiasm gap in the GOP’s favor. Meanwhile, an NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/nbc-news-poll-democrats-catch-gop-enthusiasm-rcna55859" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had the generic ballot tied among registered voters but Democrats 1 point <em>ahead</em> among likely voters, meaning that there was actually a tiny enthusiasm gap in Democrats’ favor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In both cases, that reflects improvements in Democratic enthusiasm from earlier this cycle. The previous ABC News/Washington Post <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-struggles-party-democrats-2024-poll/story?id=90427262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had shown a 4-point turnout gap favoring Republicans, and the prior NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/anger-minds-nbc-news-poll-finds-sky-high-interest-polarization-ahead-m-rcna53512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> had Republicans gaining 2 points from their likely voter screen instead of it helping Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most other polls show a modest enthusiasm gap in favor of Republicans. Republicans gain 3 points from the likely voter screen in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/cnn-poll-gop-congressional-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN’s recent generic ballot poll</a>, for instance, 2 points from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/republicans-economy-nyt-siena-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena College and The New York Times</a>, and 1 point from <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/2022-omnibus-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echelon Insights</a>. But these numbers can be noisy. In Marquette Law School’s early October <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/10/12/new-marquette-law-school-poll-survey-of-wisconsin-voters-finds-johnson-leading-barnes-in-senate-race-evers-and-michels-in-a-gubernatorial-toss-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race, the race was tied among registered voters but Republican Sen. Ron Johnson led by 6 points among likely voters. In Marquette’s more recent <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/11/02/mlsp74-press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a>, however, Johnson led by 3 among registered voters but actually lost a point and led by 2 among likely voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If there could be anything from a 6-point turnout gap favoring Republicans (as in Marquette’s October poll) to a 1-point turnout gap favoring Democrats (as in its latest one), that creates a wide range of plausible outcomes. And neither of those scenarios are necessarily crazy. There was roughly a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-point enthusiasm gap</a> favoring the GOP in the 2010 midterm, for example. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A turnout gap of <em>any</em> magnitude favoring Democrats would be unusual — typically voters from the opposition party have more enthusiasm at the midterms than the president’s party, and typically Republican voters are more likely to turn out than Democratic ones. But political coalitions are shifting, with Democrats increasingly relying on college graduates, who are <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html#:~:text=High%20school%20graduate%20turnout%20was,that%20were%20not%20significantly%20different." target="_blank" rel="noopener">considerably more likely to turn out to vote</a>. Moreover, there are some tangible signs of high Democratic enthusiasm. Their House and Senate candidates have <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/raising-bythenumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised more money</a> than Republican ones, and Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed very well</a> in a series of ballot initiatives and special elections over the summer, often on the basis of superior turnout.</p>



<h2><strong>A Wonky Aside About The Generic Ballot, the House Popular Vote, and the “National Environment”</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before we get to the third question, a note on terminology. You’ll often hear us use the terms “generic ballot,” “House popular vote” and “national environment,” but they mean somewhat different things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot tracker</a> combines what are really two types of polls. One set of polls asks voters which party they’d rather see in control of Congress. Another type asks them whether they plan to vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in their U.S. House race.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, the poll will actually name the candidates in the voter’s district — “do you plan to vote for Joe Schmoe, the Democrat, or Jane Doe, the Republican?” — but this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Since these questions tend to produce similar results, we combine them to increase the sample size and consider both to be <strong>generic ballot</strong> polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the election, you can evaluate these polls based on how well they predicted the <strong>House popular vote</strong>. That’s the number you get when you add up votes for Democratic and Republican U.S. House candidates in all 435 Congressional districts. In 2020, for instance, Democrats won this measure by <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.1 percentage points</a> — similar to, but less than, Joe Biden’s 4.5-point win in the presidential popular vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One potential source of divergence between these measures is that in some districts there’s no Democrat or Republican on the ballot, either because the party didn’t bother to nominate a candidate or because it’s a state like California and the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Top-two_primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top two finishers in the primary</a> advanced to the general election regardless of party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, there are considerably more districts with no Democratic nominee than with no Republican. Specifically, there are 23 House districts with no Democrat on the ballot<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although in 2 of those districts, the state doesn’t count the vote when a race is uncontested so it doesn’t become part of the national popular vote tally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> but 12 with no Republican. Moreover, the districts with no Democratic nominee tend to be more competitive than those with no Republican one, meaning that Democrats are sacrificing more votes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s slightly tricky to calculate exactly how big this effect is, but it will likely shift the final House popular vote margin by at least 1 percentage point toward Republicans, and probably more like 1.5 percentage points. In other words, if the final <em>generic ballot</em> margin was Republicans by 3 percentage points, we’d expect them to win the House <em>popular vote</em> by more like 4.5 percentage points because of all the districts with missing Democratic candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, you’ll sometimes hear an analyst like me describe the “<strong>national environment,” </strong>usually in a context like the following: “Democrats will need a D+1 or D+2 national environment to keep the House.” This term is more ambiguous, although I think of it as referring to what you’d expect to happen in a perfectly neutral setting: a district with no incumbent, two “average” candidates, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no partisan lean</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s sort through how all of these numbers work this year:</p>



<ul><li>Our generic ballot tracker has Republicans ahead by <strong>1.1 percentage point</strong>.</li><li>However, our model uses a slightly different version of the generic ballot that includes a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/">likely voter adjustment</a>.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our polling averages, we default to using the likely voter version of a poll if a pollster provides one, but if they don’t, we let them roll with the registered voter numbers. In our &lt;em&gt;forecast&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, we adjust the registered voter numbers based on our model’s estimate of the enthusiasm gap — an adjustment that favors Republicans this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> This helps Republicans, and they’re ahead by <strong>1.7 percentage points </strong>in this version.</li><li>Here’s where it gets more complicated. Our model also makes a forecast of the House popular vote. The estimate is determined by literally forecasting the popular vote in each district one race at a time. It is <em>not</em> just based on the generic ballot: it also accounts for factors such as district-by-district polling and incumbency. We also forecast how many people will vote in each district, accounting for past turnout and even factors such as population growth. Currently, this forecast has Republicans winning the House popular vote by <strong>4.0 percentage points</strong>. </li><li>However, as mentioned earlier, when you tally up the race-by-race forecasts, Democrats get a lot of zeros in their column because of all the districts with no Democrat running. If you back out this effect — if both parties had a candidate on the ballot in every district — Republicans would be predicted to win the House popular vote by more like <strong>2.5 percentage points</strong> instead. This is roughly what I think of as FiveThirtyEight’s forecast of the national environment. It’s about how you’d expect a Congressional race to go in an average district with no incumbent or partisan lean.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">So in case you’re wondering why Democrats have only a 17 percent chance of winning the House despite our generic ballot average being within a percentage point: our more detailed forecast suggests that Republicans have more like a 2- or 3-point advantage. On top of that, they have a slight advantage because of how voters are distributed between districts, although this is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than it was before redistricting</a>. Thus, Democrats would have to beat our forecast of the national environment by 3 or perhaps 3.5 percentage points to be favored to win the House. That’s hardly impossible — we’re talking about a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal-sized polling error</a> — but it’s a little tougher than our generic ballot average implies.</p>



<h2><strong>Question 3: How much does candidate quality matter?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here’s an important fact about this election that’s become somewhat obscured. If it weren’t for the candidates — some relatively strong Democrats and some relatively weak Republicans — Democrats would be completely screwed in the Senate, barring a major polling error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I said, FiveThirtyEight estimates that the national environment favors Republicans by about 2.5 percentage points. Now take a look at the states where pivotal Senate races are being held: Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Ohio are all <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning relative to the country overall</a>. (Consider that Biden underperformed his 4.5- point national popular vote victory in each of these states, even though he won several of them.) New Hampshire is Democratic-leaning according to our index, but just barely, enough that you’d expect it to also go Republican in a year where the national environment is GOP +2.5.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if all races went according to the national environment plus the state’s partisan lean, Democrats would lose the seats they currently hold in Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire while failing to make any gains from Republicans, resulting in a 54-46 GOP Senate. That sort of outcome is <em>not</em> out of the realm of possibility by any means at all, but it’s relatively unlikely. The GOP may well pay a price for its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-hard-to-win-a-senate-race-when-youve-never-won-an-election-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inexperienced</a>, unpopular and in some cases <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandal-plagued</a> candidates. Just how much of one could determine which party winds up with Senate control.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the time in the U.S., we elect politicians to make policy. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/forget-about-the-candidates-what-else-is-on-the-ballot-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every election year</a>, some voters are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-21-ballot-measures-were-watching-this-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confronted</a> with making their own policy decisions. Ballot measures ask voters to weigh in directly on issues from the explosive to the mundane.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But direct democracy ain’t what it used to be. According to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/ballot-measures-database.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, Americans are voting on only 136 ballot measures this November — the second-fewest in a biennial election since 1988.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes ballot measures in American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; Puerto Rico; Washington, D.C.; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Ballot measures are on the decline" aria-label="Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3ZHYx/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="426" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it doesn’t take a big number of ballot measures to have a big impact  — and some of this year’s ballot measures could significantly change policy if they pass. We’ve identified 28 particularly contentious proposals on ballots across the country on topics from abortion access to voting rights to drugs to the very nature of ballot measures themselves. Here’s what you should know.</p>



<h2><strong>Abortion</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade thrust abortion to the top of the list of things at stake in this election, as states are now free to ban or protect abortion as they see fit. According to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_abortion_ballot_measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ballotpedia</a>, six abortion-related measures were or are on the ballot in 2022. Arguably the most significant is in <strong>Michigan</strong>. The state still has a law on the books from 1931 that bans abortion, but a court has <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/09/court-rules-michigans-abortion-ban-unconstitutional.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it on hold</a> pending a final decision from the state Supreme Court. However, Proposal 3 on the Michigan ballot would create a state constitutional right to “<a href="https://www.house.mi.gov/hfa/PDF/Alpha/Ballot_Proposal_3_of_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproductive freedom</a>.” So if it passes, the court fight would be moot: Abortion would be legal in Michigan. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, the initiative in Michigan has drawn a ton of attention. The campaign has attracted <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/proposal-3-abortion-measure-generates-57m-michigan-campaign-donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$57 million in donations</a> — more than the state’s governor, attorney-general and secretary-of-state races combined. Supporters of abortion rights have outraised opponents, $40 million to $17 million, and “yes” on Proposal 3 has led in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BB7BQ4DI9ZspfM9QEDmvu4pQibsSjC0qbzYrn_Dm_Oo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every poll we’ve seen</a>. However, support has fallen recently, which is typical for ballot measures but could be a concern among abortion-rights supporters. For example, the Glengariff Group/Detroit News/WDIV-TV found the question passing 62 percent to 24 percent among likely voters in <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2022/2022/10/05/poll-where-michigan-voters-stand-on-term-limits-abortion-rights-voting-rights-ballot-proposals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late September</a> but only 55 percent to 41 percent in <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2022/2022/11/01/poll-where-michigan-voters-stand-on-3-ballot-proposals-1-week-before-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late October</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/parties-making-final-pitches-voters-fivethirtyeight-politics-92670196</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, <strong>Kentucky</strong> will vote on a completely opposite ballot measure: Amendment 2 would make explicit that the state constitution does <em>not</em> protect abortion rights. Abortion is currently prohibited in the state, but abortion-rights advocates have <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2022/08/02/kentucky-abortion-ban-reinstated-after-court-grants-camerons-request/65388729007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged the ban in court</a>. If the amendment passes, it will end their efforts to overturn the ban. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An anti-abortion ballot measure may seem like a shoo-in in a state as red as Kentucky, but that’s what people thought about Kansas before it rejected a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-vote-in-kansas-looks-like-its-going-to-be-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar referendum</a> in August. According to modeling from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/upshot/kansas-abortion-vote-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Upshot at The New York Times</a>, the level of opposition that amendment got in Kansas suggests that it would just narrowly fail in Kentucky. We haven’t seen any polls of the Kentucky measure, but abortion-rights supporters have outraised opponents there, <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/27/kentucky-abortion-bill-fight-amendment-2-crosses-6-million-mark/69590802007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$5.2 million to $952,000</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>California</strong> and <strong>Vermont</strong> will also vote to include reproductive rights in their state constitutions, but the stakes are significantly lower. Abortion is already legal and protected in both states. The states are also so liberal that the protections (<a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/election-2022/2022/10/california-abortion-law-prop-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 1</a> in California and <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2022/09/28/campaign-countdown-inside-prop-5-vermonts-reproductive-liberty-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 5</a> in Vermont) are expected to pass easily. For example, Proposal 5 led 75 percent to 18 percent in a recent <a href="https://webpubcontent.gray.tv/wcax/docs/PollThursday.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of New Hampshire/WCAX-TV poll</a>. However, in California, Democrats are still <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/10/17/californias-pro-abortion-ballot-measure-is-poised-to-pass-so-why-are-democrats-spending-so-much-time-and-money-on-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending heavily</a> in favor of Prop 1, perhaps to help Democratic politicians also on the ballot.</p>



<h2><strong>Elections</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the wake of the 2020 election, several states have tightened their voting laws or expanded access to the polls, and nine ballot measures this year could follow in that tradition. For instance, at least two states could enact stricter voter-ID laws. <strong>Arizona</strong>’s <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/11/how-arizona-prop-309-would-change-voting-id-requirements/8199456001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 309</a> would require an unexpired photo ID to vote in person — no exceptions. It would also require those who vote by mail to supply their date of birth and driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. <strong>Nebraska</strong>’s <a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/backers-foes-of-ballot-initiatives-make-final-pitch-at-public-hearing/article_ab307f6c-6885-5323-bc82-2fddf5de4e84.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initiative 432</a> would also amend the state constitution to require a photo ID to vote. Currently, Nebraska is the only strongly Republican state <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without a voter-ID law</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>Michigan</strong>’s <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/voting-rights-ballot-measure-what-proposal-2-would-change-michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 2</a> would make voting more accessible by implementing nine days of early voting, requiring a ballot drop box for every 15,000 voters in a municipality and providing free postage for absentee ballots. <a href="https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2022/10/EPIC-MRA-October-14-2022-statewide-poll-results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polls</a> have <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2022/2022/11/01/poll-where-michigan-voters-stand-on-3-ballot-proposals-1-week-before-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> this initiative passing with even more support than the proposal expanding access to abortion. Additionally, <strong>Connecticut</strong> could also begin using early voting if <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2022/10/30/ct-early-voting-constitutional-amendment-black-latino-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 1</a> passes. The state is one of only <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four</a> that does not currently offer any early voting.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/governors-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-92674801</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The rules of elections could also change in a few states if other measures pass. Most notably, <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-question-3-open-primaries-and-ranked-choice-voting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 3</a> in <strong>Nevada</strong> will determine whether the state scraps traditional partisan primaries in favor of one in which all candidates run on the same ballot. The top five vote-getters would then advance to a ranked-choice general election. (This is similar to <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/RCV.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska’s new system</a>.) But Question 3 looks unlikely to pass: Leaders from both parties have <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/bipartisan-opposition-to-question-3-mounts-with-more-republicans-against" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come out against it</a>. And in a recent poll from <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-sisolak-cortez-masto-narrowly-lead-gop-opponents-in-days-ahead-of-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent</a>, 44 percent of likely voters said they supported it, and 41 percent said they opposed it. But polls tend to <a href="https://catalist.us/2021/05/yes-you-can-generally-trust-issue-polling-but-theres-a-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overestimate support for ballot measures</a>. (Voters, it turns out, are leery of changing the status quo.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two states are even considering ballot measures that will restrict <em>future</em> ballot measures. <a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2022-10-26/history-of-arkansas-ballot-initiatives-explores-50-60-threshold-of-issue-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue 2</a> in <strong>Arkansas</strong> would require that citizen-initiated ballot measures and all constitutional amendments get 60 percent support to pass. <strong>Arizona</strong>’s <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/19/prop-132-called-both-rational-tax-safeguard-anti-democratic-power-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 132</a> would set the same threshold for ballot initiatives that would raise taxes. Also, in the Grand Canyon State, <a href="https://www.kold.com/2022/11/01/gop-backed-arizona-ballot-measures-target-voter-initiatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 128</a> would allow the state Legislature to repeal or change laws enacted via ballot measure if any part of them is struck down by the Arizona or U.S. Supreme Court. And <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/31/single-and-loving-it-prop-129-would-limit-ballot-measures-to-one-subject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 129</a> would require initiatives to stick to a single subject. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These may sound like esoteric, unimportant changes. But they’re part of a larger pattern of Republican legislatures nationwide trying to <a href="https://boltsmag.org/ballot-measures-arizona-arkansas-direct-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat policies that pass via ballot initiative</a>. For example, in recent years, Arkansas voters raised the minimum wage and legalized medicinal marijuana. And Arizona voters legalized recreational marijuana and increased taxes on the wealthy to fund teacher salaries. In response, Republican legislators put Issue 2, Prop 128, Prop 129 and Prop 132 on the ballot to make it harder for similar initiatives to pass.</p>



<h2><strong>Drugs</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Direct democracy has been a game-changer for the movement to legalize pot, particularly in conservative states. Of the 19 states and Washington, D.C., that <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow recreational marijuana use</a>, 13 legalized it at the ballot box. And this year, five more states could join the club: <strong>Arkansas</strong> (where the measure is labeled Issue 4), <strong>Maryland</strong> (Question 4), <strong>Missouri</strong> (Amendment 3), <strong>North Dakota</strong> (Measure 2) and <strong>South Dakota</strong> (Measure 27). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maryland may have the best odds of legalizing marijuana. A recent <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-sun-poll-cannabis-legalization-support-20221031-imm4bjoknfb4hifpq5nbysn6o4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpinionWorks/Baltimore Sun/University of Baltimore poll</a> found Question 4 leading 63 percent to 25 percent among likely voters. The campaign is tighter in other states: In Arkansas, “yes” on Issue 4 led a recent survey from <a href="https://talkbusiness.net/2022/10/poll-opposition-to-recreational-marijuana-amendment-grows-but-slight-majority-still-favor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hendrix College/Talk Business &amp; Politics</a> just 51 percent to 43 percent. And Amendment 3 in Missouri had 47 percent support and 39 percent opposition in an <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/missouri-2022-republican-eric-schmitt-maintains-double-digit-lead-over-democrat-trudy-busch-valentine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College/The Hill poll</a>. We haven’t seen any polling of North Dakota, but it looks like weed will remain illegal in neighboring South Dakota. Measure 27 was losing 51 percent to 40 percent in an October poll from <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/south-dakota-2022-majority-of-voters-support-governor-noem-for-re-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College/The Hill/KELO-TV</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Colorado</strong> could also become the second state to allow the use of psilocybin, a psychedelic substance found in some mushrooms. The campaign to pass Proposition 122 has raised <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/colorado-issue-committees-raise-nearly-30-million-to-influence-vote-on-ballot-measures/article_37051932-44db-11ed-acce-036e3c69b646.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than $250,000 since mid-July</a>.

<p data-paragraph="main">Another liberal policy that has proven popular at the ballot box, even in red states: expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Since 2018, Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Utah have voted to do so, bringing the total number of <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states that have expanded Medicaid</a> to 38 (plus Washington, D.C.). <strong>South Dakota</strong> looks like it’s on track to be number 39. The aforementioned Emerson College/The Hill/KELO-TV poll found Amendment D, which would expand Medicaid in the state, passing 51 percent to 22 percent. However, a significant 28 percent were undecided.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Voters in at least two states will decide whether to grant certain public services to undocumented immigrants. In <strong>Massachusetts, </strong><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/31/metro/massachusetts-election-2022-voter-guide-question-4-drivers-licenses-undocumented-immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 4</a> would uphold a law allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses. An average of two <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/massachusetts2/2022/10_18_2022_marginals.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=5E596EF808783280091104706DE85079E206CDA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/%7CElectionToplinesOctoberMassPoll2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> found the measure passing, 54 percent to 39 percent. Similarly, <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/26/higher-ed-math-proposition-308-would-let-dreamers-pay-in-state-tuition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 308</a> in <strong>Arizona</strong> would allow students, regardless of immigration status, to receive in-state tuition at public universities if they have lived in the state for two years and obtained a diploma from a state high school. Voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure to ban this in 2006, but Arizona has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-arizona-became-a-swing-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten more liberal</a> since then. Still, likely voters were split, with 45 percent supporting it and 43 percent opposing it, in a recent <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/ohpi-poll-of-record-close-races-up-and-down-the-ticket-in-arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights survey</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least two states will also vote on raising their minimum wages: <strong>Nevada</strong> to $12 per hour<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the state already has a $12 minimum wage for employees who are not offered employer-provided health insurance, but this measure &lt;a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-what-does-question-2-on-the-2022-nevada-ballot-do-about-minimum-wage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;would extend that minimum wage to all employees&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of their insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a> and <strong>Nebraska</strong> to $15 per hour. According to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Minimum_wage_on_the_ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ballotpedia</a>, states have considered 22 ballot measures to raise the minimum wage since 1998, and all 22 have passed. And these two look like they’ll be no exceptions: The measure in Nebraska, dubbed <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/is-it-time-for-nebraska-to-have-a-15-per-hour-minimum-wage-voters-will-decide-tuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initiative 433</a>, led 55 percent to 34 percent in a <a href="https://www.neilanstrategygroup.com/_files/ugd/4093a6_67f88b0f48ab44a198560203f11ed866.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Targeting/Neilan Strategy Group poll</a> from late September. And Nevada’s <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-what-does-question-2-on-the-2022-nevada-ballot-do-about-minimum-wage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 2</a> was up 65 percent to 24 percent in an October poll from the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2022/nevada-general-election-polling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Nevada, Reno</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least two more states will weigh in on gun-rights questions — one conservative, one progressive. <a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2022/11/03/iowa-voters-decide-new-gun-rights-amendment-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amendment 1</a> in <strong>Iowa</strong> would enshrine the right to bear arms in the state constitution and subject any gun regulations to “<a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2022/11/01/strict-scrutiny-key-understanding-proposed-gun-amendment-nov-8-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strict scrutiny</a>” by a court. If it passes, the ballot measure could <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/01/iowans-vote-whether-add-right-to-keep-and-bear-arms-constitution-gun-rights/10308509002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endanger current gun-control laws</a> and discourage the passage of new ones. A <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2022/10/24/iowa-gun-amendment-ballot-measure-midterm-elections-likely-pass-poll/69562113007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll by Selzer &amp; Co.</a> for the Des Moines Register/Mediacom gave it 58 percent support and 37 percent opposition. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2022/10/oregon-gun-control-measure-114-attracts-national-attention-as-one-of-strictest-in-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Measure 114</a> in <strong>Oregon</strong> would ban high-capacity magazines and make it much harder to buy a gun. The measure has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/30/1132122321/oregon-ballot-measure-114-more-difficult-buy-guns-permits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitterly divided</a> the state’s gun-rights supporters and opponents: A recent poll from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/20221102_OR_NelsonMemo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nelson Research</a> found Measure 114 coming up just short, 49 percent to 46 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, no ballot-measure round-up would be complete without mentioning <strong>California</strong>, the ballot-measure capital of the United States. According to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/2022_ballot_measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ballotpedia</a>, the Golden State is home to the two most expensive ballot-measure campaigns of the 2022 cycle, which are both on the same topic. <a href="https://abc30.com/california-sports-betting-prop-26-27-legalized-gambling/12346713/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposition 26</a> would legalize sports betting in person at Native American casinos and horse tracks, and Proposition 27 would legalize it online. The two measures <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/2022/06/sports-betting-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are not mutually exclusive</a>, but Native American tribes have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/2022-california-election-proposition-26-27-sports-betting-gambling-money-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent over $100 million</a> to pass Prop 26 and defeat Prop 27. Meanwhile, online sports-betting companies FanDuel, Bet MGM, Penn Interactive Ventures and DraftKings have contributed more than $100 million combined to pass Prop 27. Non-tribal casinos and gaming organizations have also poured $44 million into defeating Prop 26. Ironically, the three sides seem to have doomed <em>both</em> measures’ chances with their <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-04/2022-california-election-sports-betting-propostion-26-27-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative TV ads</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-their-government-october-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Institute of California</a>, voters oppose Prop 26, 57 percent to 34 percent, and Prop 27, 67 percent to 26 percent. In recent weeks, the “yes” campaigns for both measures have seemingly <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/2022/10/whats-next-for-sports-wagering-in-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conceded defeat</a> by scaling back their <a href="https://kesq.com/news/your-vote/2022/10/20/polls-show-californias-two-sports-betting-props-likely-to-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ads</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In 2020, voters elected <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/congresswoman-wears-hanbok-swearing-ceremony-honors-korean-immigrant-mom-n1252786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first three Korean American women</a> to serve in Congress: Marilyn Strickland, Young Kim and Michelle Steel. Strickland is a Democrat — like the majority of the <a href="https://history.house.gov/apa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67 Asian Americans</a> who have ever held congressional seats. But Kim and Steel defied that norm as Republicans. They also did more than simply win: Both congresswomen <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/gop-flipped-4-california-house-seats-with-diverse-slate-of-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped seats</a> in Orange County, California, quickly reversing the gains Democrats made in those districts, which are predominantly Asian American, during the blue wave of 2018. The share of voters in both districts who voted for former President Donald Trump also increased from 2016 to 2020. Taken together, these dynamics represent a slow but steady warming stance toward the GOP by Asian Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though Asian Americans currently compose just 6.2 percent of the U.S. population, they’re the country’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/09/asian-americans-are-the-fastest-growing-racial-or-ethnic-group-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-growing minority</a> and feature many tight-knit diasporic communities in battleground states like Texas and Georgia. And historically, <a href="https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2020/08/10/what-about-the-asian-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voter turnout has been low</a> among Asian Americans, a sizable share of whom also identify as independent. In other words, as toss-up races and razor-thin margins increasingly influence our politics, Asian American communities are a potentially untapped voting bloc. While Asian Americans still largely align with Democrats, the demographic’s support for the party is often, at best, misunderstood. At worst, it’s taken for granted. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For context, Asian Americans have not always voted blue. In 1992, when The New York Times first added “Asian American” as a racial category in its exit polls, <a href="https://theconversation.com/asian-americans-political-preferences-have-flipped-from-red-to-blue-145577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 percent of Asian Americans</a> voted for former President George H. W. Bush, a Republican, while 31 percent cast their ballots for then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat. In the 1996 presidential election, Democrats narrowed the margin, with 48 percent going for Republican Sen. Bob Dole and 43 for Clinton, and by 2000 Asian Americans had drifted into the blue: Fifty-four percent voted for former Vice President Al Gore and 41 percent for then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in recent years, Asian Americans seem to be shifting red. According to a 2016 <a href="https://apiavote.org/wp-content/uploads/spring16aavs-crosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> from <a href="https://apiavote.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote</a>, 19 percent of Asian Americans held at least a somewhat favorable view of Donald Trump. When the survey was conducted <a href="https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/aavs2020_crosstab_national.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again in 2020</a>, Trump’s favorability among Asian Americans had risen to 35 percent.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/parties-making-final-pitches-voters-fivethirtyeight-politics-92670196</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">One reason it’s been hard to get a clear understanding of Asian American voters is that the community is often misunderstood as a monolith. In reality, the many different ethnic groups within Asian America have many different views. For example, a plurality of Vietnamese American voters (45 percent) supported Republican congressional candidates in 2020, according to that year’s Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote survey. Vietnamese Americans, a powerful force in Steel’s California district, have been a loyally red voter bloc dating back to former President Ronald Reagan, whose anti-communism policy stances resonated with the Vietnamese diaspora by nodding to homeland geopolitics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other end of the spectrum, the survey found that Indian Americans were more likely (63 percent) than any other Asian American group to support Democrats. “After 9/11, South Asians were impacted by how political language and policies helped others formulate opinions that discriminated against them,” said <a href="https://saalt.org/lakshmisridaran-executivedirector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lakshmi Sridaran</a>, executive director of <a href="https://saalt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Asian Americans Leading Together</a>. She explained that even those who weren’t actually Muslim could still appear to be in the eyes of white Americans, and facing bigotry subsequently influenced many South Asian Americans to embrace the Democratic Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There’s a misunderstanding from political leaders when they frame hate violence against Asians and other minorities as interpersonal — people not liking each other for whatever reasons,” said Sridaran. “It feels reductionist when they don’t acknowledge how these opinions originated from governmental policies and stances.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A similar trend emerged more recently with Chinese Americans, too. According to AAPI Vote data, Trump lost support from the group between 2016 and 2020, which could in part be attributed to his sharply anti-Chinese rhetoric on COVID-19, like referring to the virus as the “kung flu.” Even still, <a href="https://www.vox.com/21561408/asian-american-voters-presidential-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s overall numbers among Asians didn’t markedly suffer</a> — suggesting that the loss was made up with growing support from other Asian ethnic groups, specifically <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-asian-americans-are-thinking-about-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vietnamese Americans and Indian Americans</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, Republicans are promoting issues — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2022/11/02/aapi-voters-california-racism-republicans-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy, education and crime</a> — that they hope can help solicit Asian American support <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/us/politics/democrats-asian-american-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in competitive political regions like Georgia</a>. The recent news of the Supreme Court’s pending decision on affirmative action, too, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/vocal-asian-american-minority-railing-affirmative-action-rcna55082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has allowed conservatives to align themselves with the subset of Asian Americans</a> who are against such policies. Meanwhile, in Nevada, one of the key states whose races could influence control of Congress, Republicans have leaned into highlighting Democrats’ inability to address the economic concerns of many Asian small-business owners who are suffering from inflation, and <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/asian-american-voters-courted-by-both-sides-in-nevada-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling data suggests</a> it’s helped secure more red votes. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/governors-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-92674801</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Interest in Asian Americans as a voting bloc is relatively new, said <a href="https://apiavote.org/about/team/christine-chen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine Chen</a>, co-founder and executive director of AAPI Vote. “[It] really began after the 2010 census because of the population growth coming from the Asian American community,” she said. “Democrats started pointed outreach then, but Republicans are catching up now.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But both parties still have a long way to go in reaching Asian American communities. According to <a href="https://apiavote.org/policy-and-research/asian-american-voter-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year’s AAPI Vote survey</a>, a majority of Asian American voters said they were not contacted by their candidates or local political groups leading up to the midterms: Sixty percent said Republicans hadn’t reached out, while 52 percent said the same about Democrats. Additionally, political literature and outreach have only recently become multilingual, said Sridaran, which could leave out the views of many Asian immigrants for whom English is not their first language. All of these factors contribute to Asian American <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/14/asian-american-pacific-islander-texas-voters-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters saying they feel ignored.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But one current House race in California also proves that not all targeted outreach is constructive, especially when it leans into inter-ethnic conflict. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In California’s newly redrawn 45th District, Steel is running against Jay Chen, a Navy veteran and entrepreneur, <a href="https://time.com/6222493/asian-american-election-california-steel-chen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in what has devolved into a bitter battle</a>. For example, posters describing Chen as “China’s Choice” were found plastered around local areas, presumably circulated to sour his image among the sizable Vietnamese American community by “red-baiting,” or harassing and discrediting someone for alleged communist sympathies. Chen, meanwhile, came under fire for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-10-22/2022-california-midterm-election-guide-district-45-steel-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mocking Steel’s accent when speaking English</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trying to tap into these homeland dynamics isn’t new, however. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/trump-modi-morrison-share-stage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a>, for one, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/howdy-modi-rally-trump-divides-indian-diaspora/598600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closely aligned himself</a> with right-wing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an attempt to appeal to Indian American Hindus, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61241849" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most well-resourced and affluent group</a> in Asian America. It could have worked, except President Biden’s vice-presidential pick of Kamala Harris, whose mother was an Indian immigrant, seemed to have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/16/trump-indian-americans-biden-kamala-harris-414504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foiled Republican inroads</a> with Indian Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, inter-ethnic dynamics among Asian American communities are only recently being understood politically, said Sridaran. And these distinctions will be increasingly important, considering Asian Americans haven’t been reliable Democratic voters for <em>all </em>that long. While many Asian Americans continue to align with the political left, it’s no guarantee that Democrats will hold onto the support of the country’s fastest-growing racial group. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On a Saturday morning in early October, Joe S.,<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe declined to give his last name because he wanted to protect his privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> an Uber driver in his 40s, was in Freedom Park in East Las Vegas, waiting for his kid’s soccer game to start. Bags and equipment were piled near his sneakered feet as he turned to the woman he was with, who was watching another game then on the field, and said he was voting for “anybody but the Democrats.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When I heard him say that, I approached him and asked him why. He responded with a mix of local issues and the economy: He blamed Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak and other Democratic leaders for teacher shortages and high gas prices, which were especially painful since they ate into his earnings as a driver. Abortion, which he heard the Democrats talking about, was a nonissue, he said. It should be up to the states, and is already protected in Nevada. “Right now you can have an abortion up to childbirth in some places,” he said, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/gop-claim-that-democrats-support-abortion-up-moment-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeating a common and misleading Republican claim</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three hours later and 9 miles away, I was in front of the Bellagio Fountain on the Strip with a small group of protesters. Local and Women’s March groups <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/08/womens-march-dc-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staged protests around the country</a> that day in support of the right to abortion access, but the Nevada women who gathered feared their state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely close Senate race</a> could tip the balance against abortion rights. And they worried that not enough people knew about it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think there’s a group of people that stay well informed and are on top of it, and they know what’s at stake, and then there’s the masses that are kind of oblivious to really how bad this is,” said Theresa Barber, a 55-year-old parts manager for a restaurant supply company who stayed at the march until the early evening, after most of the rest of the crowd of about 100 had left. She’d made a sign — Regulate Dick Not Jane — and told me she’d even tried to convince a worker at a Wendy’s drive-through to vote. “I mean, it’s bad,” she said. “We are right on the edge of losing everything.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Everything feels existential to voters in this midterm election year, and it’s no different in Nevada. The state’s Senate race, between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a toss-up</a> that could determine control of the chamber. And the race, like so many others across the country, has largely played out as a tug of war between protecting women’s rights and alleviating economic pain. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans nationwide have campaigned against Democrats’ record on the economy, and it’s been no different in Nevada.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Republicans nationwide have campaigned against Democrats’ record on the economy, and it’s been no different in Nevada. <p>MELINA MARA / THE WASHINGTON POST / GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For Republicans, soaring gas and grocery prices have revitalized decades-old attacks on Democrats’ approach to the economy as a threat to individual prosperity. For Democrats, the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has pushed them to argue that women’s rights could erode further if Republicans gain control of the Senate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polling</a> tells us the top issues on voter’s minds are inflation and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/404243/economy-top-election-issue-abortion-crime-next.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a>. But elections aren’t that simple. Candidates matter. Local conditions matter. Turnout matters. Over five days in Nevada, I saw all of those were swirling as one of the tightest races in the country barrels toward the finish line. Everywhere I went, things kept coming back to that tug-of-war between two seemingly unrelated issues. Nevada, whose economy was hard-hit by the pandemic and whose voters strongly support abortion rights, is a microcosm of the major issues defining this election year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Ana Olivas, a 35-year-old whom I met at a Latina business leaders breakfast, put it, “To me, I think human rights are No. 1, and then [the] economy is second. And somehow that’s always the two things that I feel like are in battle.”  </p>

But then came the June Supreme Court decision overturning Roe V. Wade, and early signs suggested the unpopular decision might drive voters who were angry about it to the polls. And in August, <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article263946446.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unexpectedly high turnout helped defeat a proposed constitutional</a> amendment in Kansas that would have allowed the state’s legislature to restrict abortion rights, suggesting Democrats had a path toward real electoral gains in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, the public <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/October-2022-ABC-news-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trusts Democrats on abortion</a>, and the issue was soaring in importance nationally. According to the ongoing <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a> using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, in April, 6 percent of likely voters<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined as respondents who were “certain or almost certain” to vote in the 2022 midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> listed it as one of the most important issues for the country, but that number rose to 19 percent after the decision to overturn Roe.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all six waves of the ongoing panel survey conducted between April and October, respondents were asked about the most important issues in three different ways, with the last being a multiple-choice question where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20 (including “other” or “none of these”) that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> The share of likely voters who chose it as one of the country’s top issues dipped again in the months following, but it remains higher than where it started, with 11 percent citing it as a top issue in October. Among all respondents, the trends are fairly similar, as shown in the following chart: </p>

Voters trust the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/October-2022-ABC-news-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Party more on economic issues</a>, and with the Dobbs decision further removed, the race has tightened nationally and in Nevada.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1310" height="1064" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Cortez Masto is betting that abortion is still an issue that can power Democrats over the finish line. By mid-October, Democrats and outside groups <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/abortion-is-central-issue-arizona-nevada-senate-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had spent nearly $6.2 million</a> in ads in favor of abortion rights to support Cortez Masto, according to a Washington Post analysis. On Laxalt’s side, only about $391,000 had been spent on the issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cortez Masto has warned that if Republicans control the Senate, they could pass a national abortion ban, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/grahams-proposed-total-national-abortion-ban-quickly-meets/story?id=89820730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like one proposed in September by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham</a> that would prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. “The current legislation introduced by Senator Graham stops the people in pro-choice states like mine, like Nevada, from choosing to protect the rights of women,” she said <a href="https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/news/press-releases/on-senate-floor-cortez-masto-calls-out-republican-efforts-to-pass-a-national-abortion-ban-override-nevadans-right-to-choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Senate floor</a>. It’s an issue Cortez Masto talks about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV4biJq5Sq4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English-</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWdN8yS0AT8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish-language</a> ads, in press conferences, in speeches and in meetings with Nevada voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s clear where Nevadans stand — and have stood. In 1990, a referendum protecting abortion up to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_7,_Abortion_Legal_to_24_Weeks_Statute_Referendum_(1990)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 weeks passed with 63 percent of the vote</a>, and an May 2022 analysis by The New York Times estimated that the same percentage of adults in the state still supports access to legal abortion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/upshot/polling-abortion-states.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making it one of the most pro-choice states</a> in the country. In September, an Emerson College poll <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/nevada-2022-us-senate--gubernatorial-elections-in-statistical-dead-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found that abortion access was the second-most important issue to Nevada likely voters</a>, with 18 percent saying it would determine their vote. </p>

Catherine Cortez Masto has warned that her opponent, Adam Laxalt, could cast deciding votes in the Senate to limit abortion rights nationwide. <p>TY O’NEIL / SOPA IMAGES / LIGHTROCKET / GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s also clear where Laxalt stands, though. He has said abortion regulations are best left to the states, and as Nevada’s attorney general, <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/laxalt-signs-nevada-on-to-support-alabama-abortion-restrictions-had-backed-similar-law-in-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he signed onto amicus briefs</a> in support of restrictions in other states and said he would support further restriction in Nevada. “A journalist recently asked me if I would support a referendum limiting abortion to the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, essentially, the first trimester,” he wrote in an August op-ed in the <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2022/08/02/setting-record-straight-adam-laxalt/10187587002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reno Gazette-Journal</a>. “I said that I would, and I stand by that view. I also believe that most Nevadans agree with that position.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps because of the contrast between his views and those of his potential constituents, Laxalt has largely focused on inflation during the campaign, <a href="https://www.adamlaxalt.com/post/biden-cortez-masto-agenda-causes-another-gas-price-spike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly high gas prices.</a> Economic conditions have been especially tough in Nevada. In 2019, more <a href="http://epubs.nsla.nv.gov/statepubs/epubs/31428003050115-2019-84.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than a fifth of the state’s workers</a> were employed by the hospitality industry, which was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing shutdowns. Around three-quarters of the state’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/clarkcountynevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">population lives in and around Las Vegas</a>, which is especially reliant on the industry. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, told me that about 80 percent of their workforce is back. Meanwhile, rent, gas, and grocery prices <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/news-release/consumerpriceindex_west.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> have climbed throughout the Western United States</a>, and energy prices rose 20 percent year-over-year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cortez Masto and other Democrats in the state have acknowledged the economic difficulties but have also essentially said, ‘We were there for you when you needed unemployment and COVID-19 protections, so trust us to see this recovery through.’ “Today, jobs are up, unemployment is down, and American manufacturing is back,” Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/26/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-virtual-fundraiser-with-nevada-congressional-delegation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a virtual fundraiser</a> for the Nevada congressional delegation last week. “But even with all this progress, we know folks are still struggling with inflation. …That’s why we’ve been so determined to reduce everyday costs.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Latino voters are a key political bloc every election cycle in Nevada. This year, organizers are worried about turnout. <p>AP PHOTO / JOHN LOCHER</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But the tough economy is a present reality for Nevadans, while the threat to abortion access that Cortez Masto has pointed to is a future one. This basic tension could help explain the enthusiasm gap we’ve seen between Republican and Democratic voters nationally. For example, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/cnn-poll-gop-congressional-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CNN/SSRS poll</a> from last week found that only 24 percent of Democratic voters said they were enthusiastic about voting, compared with 44 percent in 2018; for Republicans, the decline this year was just 5 percentage points, from 43 percent in 2018 to 38 percent in 2022. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Each candidate is trying to appeal to key voting blocs, not just to sway them, but to convince them to vote at all. In Nevada, that means trying to win Latino voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a Thursday afternoon, I met up with canvassers from <a href="https://www.somosvotantes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somos Votantes</a>, an independent outreach group that has endorsed Democrats and mobilizes Latino voters, as they knocked on doors of registered voters in a North Las Vegas neighborhood of brown stucco single-family homes. Without trees for shade, the midday sun was at its full power. Sunrise Mountain framed the sky to the east. The canvassers and I walked by one family butchering part of a cow in their driveway for a celebration with friends and family visiting from Texas. Another family chased after a puppy that had escaped from its yard. An ice cream truck driver, lingering for the young children just home from school, saw the canvassers’ signs and started chanting, “Masto! Masto! Masto!”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some voters said they couldn’t vote or that they didn’t pay attention to politics. Some said they needed to do more research. They were generally familiar with Cortez Masto, and many thought they would vote for her but hadn’t quite committed. Another man said Cortez Masto reminded him of Hillary Clinton and that he was voting for the other candidate. Veronica Balentine, a 54-year-old who works in health care, said affordable health care was the most important issue and that voters in the state were hearing a lot of misinformation in ads. Jose Bobadilla, a 30-year-old who’d heard stories about crime in the 1990s, was worried about gun rights. These voters, immersed in their everyday lives, brought their own set of concerns and issues to the election; the back-and-forth of the campaigns felt far away.</p>

Whether this key bloc of voters shows up for Democratic candidates, swings toward Republicans or stays home could be a deciding factor. “My biggest thing that’s sort of keeping me up at night is not actually that Latinos are vote-switching, but it’s that the base is going to stay home,” said Melissa Morales, president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, which has endorsed Cortez Masto, the first Latina in the Senate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Morales said the economy is an overriding concern for the voters her organization speaks with, but what that means can vary. People are worried about rising rents and the costs of healthcare and medicine as much as they’re worried about prices at the grocery store — so her organization always opens its door-to-door conversations by talking about cost-of-living issues. “I think there’s obviously the relief that, especially in a state like Nevada, that was the hardest hit by unemployment, that the jobs are back,” Morales said. “They’re able to sort of work to make ends meet. But also the realization that it’s just hard. All of it feels hard.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/governors-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-92674801</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Morales said that in their focus groups with young Latino voters, abortion remains a top issue. “It has been hard to get them excited or motivated or really sort of mobilized around anything for the past two years,” she said. “But what we’ve seen that’s starting to really take root and with those voters is the abortion and … the climate provisions in the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act].” Overall, Latino voters support <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/16/abortion-latino-issues-voters-midterms-00052119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to abortion by large majorities</a>. But will they come out to vote because of it?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In such a tight race, anything could tip the scales. Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-courts-c9674bbf1090515bfad0920344f17037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won Nevada by 33,596</a> votes. “Nevada is an extremely divided state,” Pappageorge said. “More than most folks understand — it’s one-third Democrats, one-third Republican, one-third independent. But most voters aren’t extremists. Most voters don’t believe in extremism on the right or extremism on the left.” Perhaps it’s fitting, then, Nevada could be the state that determines the balance of power in a divided Senate amid an increasingly divided country.</p>]]></description>

<p>When Will We Know 2022 Midterm Election Results?A complete guide to poll closing times, vote counting and races to watch in every state.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/">Nathaniel Rakich</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/elena-mejia-lutz/">Elena Mejía</a></p>
<p>When are we going to know the results of the midterms? In 2020, due to slow vote counting in many states, it took days — until Saturday, Nov. 7 — for ABC News to declare Joe Biden the president-elect. We likely won’t have to wait <i>that</i> long this year, but it is again possible that we won’t know the winners of the 2022 election on election night. States like Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania that are key to Senate control could take multiple days to count all their votes.</p>
<p>The exact timing of the results depends on the state; each has different rules for when and how votes are counted. But we can make an educated guess based on when each state reported results in its primary election earlier this year.<a tabindex="0" data-number="1" aria-label="Footnote 1.

<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that the rate of vote counting in the general election will match that of the primary. So we’ve also gathered information from state election officials and Edison Research, which provides live election results to ABC News, about when we can expect 2022 election results.</p>
<p>Even those estimates, though, are not ironclad. If there’s one thing to know about election night, it’s to expect the unexpected. <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-broward-election-audit-2018-brenda-snipes-20200526-rswvxtj2ljasjmfi7w75moo52e-story.html">Human error</a> or <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2020/02/04/iowa-caucus-delayed-results-mean-no-winner-yet-iowa-caucuses/4653022002/">technical difficulties</a> can delay results. Most importantly, if a race is extremely close, it probably won’t be called for days. Even in states that count votes fast, a small number of provisional and absentee ballots aren’t counted until days later. And of course, if a race goes to a recount or is legally challenged, it can take weeks to declare a winner.</p>

However, some mail ballots will still be outstanding since Nevada accepts mail ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrive by Nov. 12. Those could matter in a close race. Results will continue to roll in until Nov. 15.</p>

<p>The secretary of state is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/late-start-counting-midterm-mail-votes-means-wait/story?id=91344266">keeping expectations low</a>. While Election Day votes are expected to be reported on election night, officials are not allowed to start processing absentee ballots until Tuesday morning. Counting those votes could take days, but there are a few reasons to think <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-2022-election-results-vote-count-timing-20221020.html">it will take less time than it did two years ago</a>. First, it’s likely that fewer absentee ballots will be cast this year than in 2020. Counties are also more experienced and prepared for a large volume of absentees. And most counties are only allowed to stop counting once they’re done. Several counties told the Philadelphia Inquirer that they expect to be mostly done counting by Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>It’s going to take a while. Washington is a vote-by-mail state, and ballots only have to be postmarked by Election Day, not necessarily received by then. Typically, counties report a large batch of votes right after polls close, with hourly updates for the rest of election night. Then, counties report the results of later-arriving ballots at the end of every day until all ballots are counted. This year, the secretary of state’s office is anticipating that between 40 and 50 percent of the vote will be reported on election night, and the vast majority will be reported by Friday. However, the numbers won’t be final until the results are certified on Nov. 29.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are just four days until Election Day. The race for the Senate is still on a knife’s edge and Republicans have a clear advantage in the House. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew talks about which states they expect results from first on election night and how the early voting process is going so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then, they turn to the issues that both parties have spent the most advertising money on and listen to a few examples. Lastly, the team breaks down which candidates who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election are most likely to win their races and how they could impact future elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this week, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-republican-sweep-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I spoke with Nathan Redd</a>, a “friend” of mine (actually, a fragment of my alter ego) who attempted to convince me that Republicans will do <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even better than the FiveThirtyEight forecast suggests</a>. Today, you’ll meet Nathaniel Bleu, another figment of my imagination who I spoke with at a wine bar in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where he lives with his husband and two French bulldogs. Bleu, an ad sales executive with a major New York publishing company, expressed confidence that Democrats will win, although as you’ll see his confidence was easily shaken. An abbreviated transcript of our conversation follows.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> Happy election season, Nate. I’ve never seen everyone so terrified.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Well, if I can put on my concerned citizen hat for a moment —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>That looks more like a Detroit Tigers hat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Very funny.<strong> </strong>If I can put on my concerned citizen hat for a moment, there’s good reason to be worried. All those <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election deniers on the ballot</a>. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/02/1133465632/why-conspiracy-theories-about-paul-pelosis-assault-keep-circulating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack on Paul Pelosi</a>. I’m not sure where this leads, but it doesn’t seem like it’s a good place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>That’s not what I’m talking about. I’ve never seen everyone so terrified to admit that Democrats are going to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Ummmmm —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> Even you, Nate. You know I have the utmost respect for you and FiveThirtyEight. Why, I’d have a whole menagerie of Fivey Fox plush dolls if I could. But your forecast has Democrats winning and you’re terrified to admit it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>It very much does <em>not</em> have Democrats winning. Are you reading those <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1585038499908288512?s=20&amp;t=vaPsuc0_SnvuCGmn7ANi6w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake FiveThirtyEight alerts from the DCCC</a>?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>The <em>Deluxe</em> forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has Republicans ahead</a>. But I don’t trust all the subjectivity it introduces —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>For the record, I’m going to object to that characterization of the Deluxe forecast —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> The Lite forecast has Democrats winning. That’s the one I trust.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Lite has them<em> barely</em> ahead in the Senate. And Republicans are closing so quickly, that lead might disappear by the time we get to Tuesday. And that’s to say nothing of the House, where Republicans are heavy favorites. Besides, Deluxe is the better, more accurate product.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I could almost see the grin on your face when Republicans went ahead in Deluxe the other day. It’s just so much <em>safer</em> for you that way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>You think of me as risk-averse? You’re the one who still refuses to eat dinner indoors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Not true. Only during that Omicron surge last winter. Was that the last time we saw each other? Besides, it’s a lovely evening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I can barely feel my toes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>To be fair, it’s not just you. It’s everybody. You and me and everyone in the media. Everybody is terrified of predicting that <em>anything</em> good happens for Democrats, having a replay of 2016 and looking foolish again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>You don’t work in “the media.” You work in ad sales for a media company. Just because you see David Remnick in the Condé Nast cafeteria doesn’t make you Maggie Haberman.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong><em>Somebody</em> needs another glass of wine. The truth is, nobody knows how this election is going to turn out. It’s just people groping around trying to sound smart. It’s the supply of takes meeting the demand for takes. And right now, the take everyone wants is “Republicans are going to win.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I don’t really buy that at all. Turn on MSNBC, and you’ll see <a href="https://twitter.com/thereidout/status/1587251935597445120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of hopium for Democrats about early voting and turnout and whatever else</a>. People like takes that flatter their sensibilities. But I’m not interested in the psychology of your brunchmates. I’m interested in why you think our forecast might be wrong, and you haven’t said a word about that yet. Besides, I expected you to be on Team Gloom. I thought you’d be apoplectic by this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I <em>was</em> on Team Gloom. Why, I might as well have been the quarterback. And then I went to Kansas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>What the hell were you doing in Kansas? I know you and Corey were talking about buying a country home, but that’s a long —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Well, Corey grew up in Topeka. So we were out there for “No on 2” — you know, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/us/elections/results-kansas-abortion-amendment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion referendum</a>. We were even doing a little canvassing. I knew that No was going to win, I knew in particular how strongly younger women felt about it. But even I didn’t expect it to win by, what was it, 18 percentage points?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>It was impressive, no doubt. And if Tuesday was some sort of national referendum on <em>Roe</em>, I’m sure Democrats would do pretty well. But —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Let me stop you right there. Because it <em>wasn’t</em> just Kansas. There were a bunch of special elections, too. Are you familiar with the website FiveThirtyEight dot com? Here, I’m going to pull my phone out because I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bookmarked the page</a> just to make sure I got this right. According to Mr. Nathaniel Rakich — lovely first name, by the way — things changed after Roe was overturned. “Since that decision … Democrats have outperformed their expected margins in [four special House elections] by an average of 9 points.” And that doesn’t even count <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska</a>! You’re telling me Democrats are going to have a bad year when they’re winning elections in Kansas and Alaska?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m telling you that we’re not in Kansas anymore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’m telling you that Democrats’ position has deteriorated since then. You hold this election in August, and yeah, I think Democrats keep the Senate and maybe even the House. But the polls have been pretty clear in showing a Republican rebound.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>So now we come full circle. Have the polls shifted, or has there been more of a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/02/a-vibe-shift-is-coming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>vibe shift</em></a>? And is the vibe shift real, or is it just an artifact of media coverage? Because I don’t see what’s so different now compared with August.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Nate: </strong>Oh boy, this is starting to sound conspiratorial. And there’s a <em>lot</em> that’s changed since August. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/13/business/inflation-cpi-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bad news on inflation</a>. About a zillion <a href="https://twitter.com/DyjuanTatro/status/1587205829953994752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News segments on crime</a> and “defund the police.” And it’s not really even that Democrats are losing ground so much as that Republicans are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding undecided voters</a>— people who were probably going to vote for them all along. It’s all been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very normal in some sense</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I’m certainly not alleging any conspiracy, or connivance, or cabal. I’m saying that pollsters have incentives, and those incentives run toward giving Republicans the most optimistic numbers they can, because they’ll <a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/719276/why-it-matters-if-the-polls-miss-again/?unlock=G312XOQO4PT6RXHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a ton of grief if they miss high on Democrats again</a>, but nobody will care if they overestimate Republicans by a point or two.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Well, a few things here, because this is quite the claim you’re making. Number one, you could have made exactly the same argument in 2020, and yet the polls had an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even bigger Democratic bias than in 2016</a>! Number two, I’m not sure the incentives are so obvious, and the <em>clearest</em> incentive is that you just want to be accurate. Number three, I think you’re underestimating the pollsters. Sure, some of them are cynical and partisan, but most of them see what they do as a public service —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Why how lovely! Let’s send a fruit basket to the Pew Research Center to thank them for their service! Do you think Trafalgar and Rasmussen care about public service? They’re <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/biden-gap-senate-surveys-00064362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooding the zone</a> with partisan polls!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Actually, they were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the most accurate pollsters in 2020</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I don’t care. A broken clock is right twice a day. You have tons of Republican polls, and no Democratic ones. It’s going to skew the averages.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m not so sure that’s true, at least for FiveThirtyEight. Our model <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a house-effects adjustment</a>, so if a pollster consistently shows overly rosy results for Republicans — or for Democrats, for that matter — it takes that into account. And besides, to your point about incentives, it’s a free market. If there’s a firm with a turnout model that shows great results for Democrats, they can publish those numbers if they have confidence in them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I can tell this whole discussion is making you uneasy. You’ve looked uncomfortable all night. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m just a little chilly. Indoors next time? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Look, it’s not a great situation. As America gets more partisan, and trust in institutions erodes, there are a lot of downstream, negative consequences for pollsters. To start with, most people <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/27/response-rates-in-telephone-surveys-have-resumed-their-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basically don’t answer phone calls from unknown numbers anymore</a>. So people who do answer polls are weird in some sense, and they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/upshot/midterms-polling-phone-calls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not be representative of the electorate</a>. You used to be able to default to more of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-bad-pollsters-copying-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold standard in polling</a> — it was expensive, but you could do it. Now, there are a lot more choices to make. On top of that, trust in the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403166/americans-trust-media-remains-near-record-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media is about as low as it’s ever been</a>. Does that make pollsters more likely to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stick with the herd</a> instead of publishing numbers that could cause them a lot of grief? Maybe, but I’m not going to make too many assumptions about that until Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>So if we can’t trust the polls, maybe we should look at early voting data instead —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Oh, no no no no no. Let me stop you right there. <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/no-really-dont-pay-attention-to-early-voting-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s a trap</a>. There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/upshot/georgia-election-expect-the-early-vote-count-to-be-misleading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely reliable benchmarks to use</a>, and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/early-voting-was-a-misleading-indicator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis inevitably reflects people’s partisan priors</a>. About the only person I trust to any degree at all on early voting is Jon Ralston in Nevada, and <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/the-early-voting-blog-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he thinks the numbers there look pretty <em>bad</em> for Democrats</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Have you agreed with a single thing I’ve had to say, Nate? I could once count on you to defy conventional wisdom. Now you sound just like everybody else. What do you <em>really</em> think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> My least favorite question! I don’t have some private set of beliefs that I keep to myself! I trust our forecast, which is based on a computer program I wrote four years ago and not my mood as I’m sitting here with a glass of pinot! Our forecast says that the Senate is a toss-up at best for Democrats, and the momentum has been with Republicans. But I’m not sure what we’re really arguing about. I agree that the special elections were good for Democrats. And I very much agree that Democrats <em>could</em> beat their polls. It’s an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entirely realistic scenario</a>. But it’s not the likeliest scenario. Besides, the president’s party doing poorly in the midterms would be about the most <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/analyses/the-2022-midterm-elections-what-the-historical-data-suggest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal thing imaginable</a>, especially with inflation at 8 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> You keep using that word “normal,” but we’re not in normal times anymore. This country is going to hell.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>So you’re on Team Gloom after all!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Just tell me there’s a chance, a chance that Democrats keep the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>There’s a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent chance</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I’ll take it.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Ah, Southern California: Movie stars, outrageously good weather, interminable traffic. And recently, a bunch of highly competitive races for the U.S. House of Representatives. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2018, Democrats flipped five Republican-held seats in and around the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas, including four that contained parts of or were entirely within Orange County, the <a href="https://fullertonobserver.com/2020/01/03/remembering-nixonland-how-the-modern-rep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic base of the California GOP</a>. But in 2020, Republicans won back three of those five seats, and this year — in an electoral environment that generally favors them — they’re hoping to not only hold onto those seats, but also capture more districts being defended by Democratic incumbents in Southern California.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, we’re defining Southern California as everything south of San Luis Obispo, Kern and San Bernardino counties, inclusive of those counties, which run west to east across the state. The districts we examined here are located entirely in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Following redistricting</a>, however, there are no surefire pickups for the GOP, as the potentially endangered Democratic incumbents in the region are defending seats that are at least 5 percentage points more Democratic-leaning than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> As things stand, the Democrats in those seats are favored to win reelection. However, we’ve seen things <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to improve for the GOP nationally</a>: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a> now gives Republicans an 85-in-100 shot<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All figures in this story are based on the “Deluxe” forecast as of 5 p.m. Eastern on Nov. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> of winning a majority in the House. Under these circumstances, the upper-end range of outcomes for the GOP could include wins in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some blue-leaning seats</a> in Southern California.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the political environment, Republicans could make inroads in these districts because they <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-07/orange-county-went-for-biden-but-the-blue-wave-might-all-but-disappear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t necessarily as blue as they seem</a> based on <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/four-california-districts-split-tickets-for-president-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2020 presidential vote</a> alone. That’s because some voters in this region are still more inclined to vote Republican down-ballot. Looking at House incumbents running in potentially competitive seats,<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be more inclusive, we included any seat with a partisan lean between D+20 and R+20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> we can see how this played out in 2020, as the Democratic incumbents mostly ran behind President Biden and the Republican incumbents ran ahead of former President Donald Trump, as the table below shows.</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This degree of Democratic underperformance was atypical. Across the country, Democratic incumbents in the House ran about even with Biden in 2020, on average, although there were plenty who clearly ran ahead or behind him.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on an analysis of the two-party vote for president and House in 178 districts with Democratic incumbents running that had House candidates from both parties who combined to win at least 95 percent of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> But in Southern California, Democratic Reps. Mike Levin, Katie Porter and Julia Brownley all ran 4 to 7 points behind Biden, while only Rep. Raul Ruiz ran ahead of the now-president among the Democratic incumbents we’re looking at here. Meanwhile, most of the Republican incumbents in this group ran ahead of Trump, including the three Republicans who won back Democratic-held seats in 2020 — Republican Reps. Mike Garcia, Young Kim and Michelle Steel. Now, redistricting has changed the district lines since 2020, but we’re talking about Biden-supporting turf that in some cases backed Republican John Cox in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yr9mcAtuUdNjI9NEPYKxXsEldzzQ2ZaDwEAbnPRyS4/edit#gid=1938542161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 gubernatorial race</a>, which now-Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by 24 points statewide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Among these Democratic incumbents, Levin had the largest gap between how he performed in 2020 versus Biden. Back then, Levin ran against Republican Brian Maryott, whom the Democrat <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-general/sov/24-us-reps.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated by</a> 6 points, 53 percent to 47 percent. Now Levin is facing Maryott again in the 49th District, and as this seat only changed a little bit in redistricting, the race is largely being fought on the same light-blue turf that straddles the coastal border between Orange and San Diego counties — but in a better Republican environment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news for Levin is that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/49/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast gives</a> him an 86-in-100 shot of winning, buttressed in part by a <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2022-11-01/49th-mike-levin-joe-biden-brian-maryott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late October poll</a> from SurveyUSA/The San Diego Union-Tribune/ABC 10News that found Levin up 49 percent to 43 percent. Still, that result was well inside the margin of error, and the outside spending in this race suggests both parties view it as highly competitive: As of Oct. 24, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and House Majority PAC had spent $3.3 million to aid Levin, while the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee and Congressional Leadership Fund had poured in $3.4 million to help Maryott, according to data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQJRWqwoOQQcs_5mMW2rkuMK8hXB3GgcOhBFj6rJ-wE/edit#gid=1259988719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compiled by Daily Kos Elections</a>. And heading into the final days of the campaign, Levin <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/49/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had</a> over a $1 million to $430,000 edge over Maryott in his campaign account.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just up the coast is Porter, who in two terms has become a high-profile member of the House thanks to <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/inside-the-issues/2022/08/29/katie-porter-looks-to-hold-gun-manufacturers-accountable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her withering questioning</a> in congressional hearings. Porter ran about 5 points behind Biden in 2020 while winning by 7 points, 53.5 percent to 46.5 percent, but while her new district has a partisan lean (D+6) similar to that of her old turf,<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the old 45th District, her previous seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> a majority of the 47th District’s constituents are new to her: Only 41 percent of the people living in Porter’s old seat are in her new one, which is located entirely within Orange County.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Porter has needed to spend money to familiarize voters with her story and her record in Congress. Helpfully for her, though, Porter is one of the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/most-expensive-races?senateraisedcycle=2020&amp;senatespentcycle=2020&amp;housespentcycle=2020&amp;houseraisedcycle=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most prodigious fundraisers</a> in the House, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/47/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $23.0 million and spent $24.4 million this cycle. Entering the last days of the campaign, she had $8.9 million in the bank to Republican Scott Baugh’s $139,000. Still, Republicans haven’t given up here, as the NRCC and CLF have tried to give Baugh a lift with $3.5 million in outside spending. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/47/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our forecast gives</a> Porter a 77-in-100 shot of defeating Baugh. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the suburbs north of Los Angeles, Brownley ran about 4 points behind Biden in 2020, but her largely unchanged district is far bluer than the seats Levin or Porter are running in. As such, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast gives</a> Brownley about a 95-in-100 shot of defeating Republican Matt Jacobs, right on the dividing line between “solid” and “likely” Democratic. Yet <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/27/maloney-dems-new-york-midterms-00063645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent reporting by Politico</a> suggests Brownley is worried: She’s asked Democratic colleagues for financial assistance, based in part on internal polling that shows a close race (we haven’t been able to get our hands on those polls). The NRCC <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/30/republicans-biden-seats-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has now entered the fray</a>, too, as it plans to make a “six-figure” investment in the seat. But Brownley did have about <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/26/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six times as much money</a> in the bank as Jacobs ($1.9 million to $300,000) as of Oct. 19 and remains favored, although she may be in for a closer-than-expected outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To the east, there’ve been few signs that Ruiz is in any danger in the 25th District. Ruiz is the one Democratic incumbent in this group who ran ahead of Biden in 2020, and although his district is a touch less blue than Brownley’s, his race has seen <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CA25&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost no outside spending</a>. Moreover, Ruiz had $2.1 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/25/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his war chest</a> for the last weeks of the campaign, much more than the $19,000 Republican Brian Hawkins had. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our forecast gives</a> Ruiz a 94-in-100 shot of winning, just shy of being rated as solidly Democratic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning quickly to the Republicans who might be in danger, the main one is Garcia, who is seeking reelection in the new 27th District north of Los Angeles, which went from about D+5 to D+8 in redistricting.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the old 25th District, the seat’s previous number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> Notably, Garcia is facing Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman, for the third straight time: He defeated her in a May 2020 special election to capture this seat, held the seat in the November 2020 general election <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-general/sov/24-us-reps.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by a 333-vote margin</a> and now meets her again in 2022. And a third win could well be on his way: Garcia has a 65 in 100 shot of winning, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per our forecast</a>, and considering he ran 10 points ahead of Trump in 2020, it’s not as surprising he has an edge in this blue-leaning district. Moreover, there’ve been other signs Garcia is well-positioned, including the recent decision by major outside Democratic groups <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1583489245708423168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to cut their ad spending</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have also hoped to make inroads against Kim, Steel and even longtime Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, but each race is rated at least likely Republican in our forecast. On paper, Steel could be in danger in her race against Democrat Jay Chen in the new 45th District — it’s a D+5 seat and she currently represents only 16 percent of its constituents. But Steel <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/45/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised Chen</a> and has received $1.1 million in support from the NRCC and CLF, while Chen has received no outside help from the DCCC or House Majority PAC.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All in all, Democrats are on the defensive in Southern California. And while their most endangered incumbents are running in blue-leaning districts, the Republican-leaning national political environment and the tendency for some voters in this region to vote Republican down-ballot may give the GOP the chance to make further gains in the region.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong> </strong>Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, a man broke into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-pelosis-husband-violently-assaulted-san-francisco-home/story?id=92280229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violently attacked her husband</a>, Paul. While Pelosi’s husband is expected to make a full recovery, and details are still emerging about the attack, it was a brutal realization of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/01/us/politics/violent-threats-lawmakers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the increase in threats of violence</a> against lawmakers and their families in recent years. And most disturbingly, recent polling shows that some Americans say political violence is sometimes justified. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polls in recent months have gauged Americans’ views on political violence in a few different ways, but they almost always capture some segment of the population that deems political violence acceptable. When asked whether the use of force or violence was justified “to advance an important political objective,” 1 in 5 Americans said it was, at least sometimes, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1.full-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a survey from researchers at the University of California, Davis</a>, conducted in May and June. And in a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-09/Ipsos%20Poll%20Presidential%20Approval%20Tracker%20and%20Biden%27s%20Speech%2009%2008%202022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos poll from September</a>, 17 percent of Americans somewhat or strongly agreed that political violence against those they disagreed with was acceptable, with slightly more Democrats agreeing with the statement than Republicans or independents. However, just a small fraction of registered voters said taking up arms or a civil war was necessary to fix our democracy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/18/upshot/times-siena-poll-toplines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a recent New York Times/Siena poll</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As striking as some of those results are, some research suggests Americans’ true views are much more passive. Some of these responses can be chalked up to respondents not paying close enough attention, vaguely worded questions or both, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116870119#sec-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in March. The study’s authors found that, when engaged with the survey and presented with specific examples of political violence, between 89 and 100 percent of respondents wanted a suspect in a politically motivated violent crime charged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless, the reality is that threats of political violence are on the rise, and it’s making Americans concerned. When asked whether they were “concerned that extremists will commit acts of violence after the election if they are unhappy with the election outcome,” 64 percent of Americans said they somewhat or strongly agreed, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/americans-continue-to-feel-economic-pressure-with-inflation-remaining-top-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a Reuters/Ipsos poll fielded in October</a>. Similarly, 48 percent of Americans said they were very or somewhat concerned about the possibility of violence associated with the 2022 midterms, according to a <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Midterm2022ToplinesOctoberNational2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMass/YouGov poll</a> conducted in October. And Black Americans are much more likely than white or Hispanic Americans to expect “displays of violence” related to the midterms, <a href="https://www.grid.news/story/politics/2022/10/17/poll-black-americans-are-most-likely-to-expect-election-violence-this-november-and-its-compelling-them-to-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Grid-Harris poll</a>, also from October. When asked whether they thought election results would spark displays of violence in their area, 40 percent of Black Americans said it was very or somewhat likely, compared to 23 percent of white Americans and 36 percent of Hispanic Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet once again, the sentiments captured in polling don’t necessarily translate to reality. In a recent YouGov/Economist poll, a majority of Americans (51 percent) said they thought it’s very or somewhat likely that there will be violence at polling places this election, but only 30 percent were concerned about it. And in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/midterm-election-voters-democracy-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that New York Times/Siena poll</a>, 71 percent of voters said democracy was at risk in America, but only 7 percent said it was the most important problem facing the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather than embracing political violence as acceptable, Americans are more likely to find ways to downplay the threat. In response to the attack on Pelosi this week, some Republicans and right-wing figures <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/01/paul-pelosi-conspiracy-theories-debunked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been spreading conspiracy theories</a> that the attack was actually the result of a lovers quarrel, a baseless reframing that disregards the possibility that the violence was politically motivated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The broader reality of political violence in the U.S. is much more complex than a single poll question can capture. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/#part1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve reported before</a>, political polarization is leading more Americans to become distrustful, spiteful and even hateful of those who have different political views from them, creating a dangerous environment for democracy and those who would be willing to use violence to dismantle it. The attack last week is a stark reminder that it only takes a single person taking these ideas to the extreme to cause real damage, let alone the thousands we saw on Jan. 6. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>In the run-up to Election Day, the economy continues to be the most pressing political concern for Americans, according to an Oct. 14-18 <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/10/27/inflation-remains-top-issue-for-midterm-voters">poll from Data for Progress</a>. Forty-five percent of likely voters (a plurality) named inflation as one of the top three issues congressional candidates should focus on, while 30 percent said jobs and the economy. Meanwhile, voters were split on which party would be better equipped to address such concerns. While both Republican and Democratic likely voters had more faith in their respective parties, a larger share of independents leaned to the right, with 46 percent saying Republicans would be better equipped to tackle economic issues and inflation. </li><li>A recent <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/10/27/politics-election-vice-news-yougov-polls-oct-2022">YouGov survey conducted for Vice News</a> found that 23 percent of Republicans thought white supremacy extremism is a major problem in the U.S., while 37 percent considered it a minor one. Still, Democrats were far more likely to regard white supremacy extremism as a major (73 percent) or minor (20 percent) issue. </li><li>Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter has elicited a partisan response. A <a href="https://civicscience.com/immediate-insights-republicans-are-bullish-on-elon-musks-twitter-takeover/">CivicScience poll</a> conducted Oct. 28 found that close to half of Republicans (43 percent) said they’ll be more likely to use the platform under Musk’s ownership, while a similar share of Democrats (40 percent) said they’d be less likely to use it. Independents were split, with 25 percent saying they’d be more likely to use Twitter, versus 27 percent who reported they’d be less inclined. Meanwhile some just need more time: Sixteen percent said they’ll wait to see what changes Musk makes over the next few months before deciding their Twitter usage. </li><li>For many Americans, the decision to use Twitter may hinge around whether the platform lifts its ban on former President Donald Trump’s account, although Americans are split on the issue. Forty-two percent of Americans support allowing the former President to return to Twitter, but an equal share says the opposite, according to a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/10/31/3ea6e/1">YouGov poll</a> conducted Monday. </li><li>Forty-five percent of Americans believe that the U.S. should be a “Christian Nation,” according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/10/27/45-of-americans-say-u-s-should-be-a-christian-nation/">Pew Research Center study</a>. And while 60 percent also said that the founding fathers originally intended for the country to be a “Christian Nation,” just 33 percent of Americans said it is currently one. Meanwhile, only 15 percent of Americans think that Supreme Court justices should factor their own religious views into decisions of major cases. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> 42.2 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 53.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11 points). At this time <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-did-americans-stop-caring-about-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, 42.3 percent approved and 53 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -10.7 points).

<p data-paragraph="main">As recently as a few weeks ago, the Georgia Senate race seemed to be tipping toward incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock. A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">string of controversies</a> plagued the Republican candidate, Herschel Walker, and in mid-October, our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> gave Warnock a 3- to 4-percentage-point edge over his opponent. Around the same time, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a> put Warnock at an almost 6-in-10 chance of getting reelected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the dynamics of the race are different now. Sure, Walker is still dogged by allegations, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/herschel-walker-denies-new-abortion-allegation-rcna54205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which he denies</a>, that he encouraged and/or paid for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple women</a> to terminate their pregnancies, despite once campaigning on a platform that includes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total ban on abortions</a>. (In recent weeks, Walker’s anti-abortion stance <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/walker-warnock-georgia-abortion-00061971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has softened somewhat</a>. He now says he agrees with a state law banning the procedure after six weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.) But Warnock’s lead over his Republican rival has slimmed to just over 1 point in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of 5 p.m. on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> Meanwhile, national Republicans have closed ranks around Walker, despite these accusations and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous others</a> levied against him. After the first abortion allegation but before the second, Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/sens-rick-scott-tom-cotton-campaign-herschel-walker-rcna51383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traveled to the Peach State</a> to join Walker on the campaign trail. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a>, the race is considered a toss-up. Specifically, Walker now has a 55-in-100 chance of winning, and Warnock has a 45-in-100 chance of winning. And our forecast’s projection for the popular vote is razor-thin: 49.3 percent for Walker, 49.2 percent for Warnock and 1.6 percent for Libertarian candidate <a href="https://www.foxcarolina.com/2022/10/25/candidate-us-senate-l-ga-chase-oliver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chase Oliver</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So Walker wins by the narrowest of margins … right? Not so fast. As it turns out, 49.3 percent of the vote wouldn’t be enough for him to win outright. <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ga/title-21-elections/ga-code-sect-21-2-501.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia law</a> mandates that candidates must receive a majority of the vote in order to win an election; if no one does so, the top-two finishers advance to <a href="https://www.sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/2022%20State%20Scheduled%20Elections%20Short%20Calendar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a runoff election on Dec. 6</a>. Oliver’s presence on the ballot complicates things because he could, theoretically, siphon votes from both candidates and prevent Walker or Warnock from reaching the 50 percent threshold required to win on the first ballot. And with the tightening of the race, it’s looking increasingly likely that the Georgia Senate race will head to a runoff — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a>. That could give Walker or Warnock a second chance to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what can we expect if Walker and Warnock go head-to-head in December? Well, conditions likely won’t look as rosy for Democrats as they did in January 2021, when Warnock and Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/georgia-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both narrowly defeated</a> their Republican rivals, former Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively, in their runoff races. In fact, our Deluxe forecast estimates that, if this race <em>were </em>to go to a runoff, Walker would win about 68 percent of the time.</p>

 <p>Georgia rules require a candidate to win a majority of the vote in general elections or special elections; if no candidate wins a majority, there is a runoff between the top-two finishers. If a special election took place on a regular general election date, it is included in this table. In these cases, there may be multiple candidates from each party running, so the Democratic and Republican totals are the combined vote share of all candidates from that party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That could be the case because, as the chart above shows, Georgia runoffs <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have typically favored Republicans</a>. Since the late 1960s, Georgia has seen 11 runoffs between a Democrat and a Republican for statewide office, and the runoff margin was better for Republicans than the general-election margin in seven of them. This is largely attributable to the drop-off in turnout — fewer people vote in runoff races than in general elections — and the decline usually disproportionately affects Democrats. “In runoff elections, the question is, ‘Who can get their people back to vote?’ And Republicans have historically had more success with that,” said <a href="https://spia.uga.edu/faculty-member/charles-s-bullock-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Bullock</a>, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This was no accident, either: <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anxiety/episodes/racist-history-georgia-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The runoff law has racist roots</a>. Voting is highly polarized by race in Georgia, which means that white voters tend to support Republican candidates and Black voters overwhelmingly support Democrats. The runoff system was created in the 1960s as a way of preserving white political power in a heavily Black state while undermining the political clout of Black lawmakers who could win more easily in a multicandidate race with a plurality of the vote, according to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tellingallamericansstories/upload/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Interior Department report</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not what happened in the 2021 runoff. That year, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/29/new-georgia-runoffs-data-finds-that-more-black-voters-than-usual-came-out-trump-voters-stayed-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black turnout stayed high</a>, while whiter and more rural precincts saw a smaller share of voters at the polls. Warnock and Ossoff <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also improved on</a> President Biden’s margins, particularly in counties with the largest shares of Black voters. As a result, Georgia <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/warnock-georgia-first-black-senator/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected its first Black senator</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2021, though, there were a number of factors working in Democrats’ favor. Democrats worked diligently <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-democrats-may-have-found-their-own-southern-strategy-a-black-centric-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to encourage their voters</a> to turn out to the polls. The fact that the runoffs were going to decide which party controlled the Senate also generated a lot of interest in the campaign (<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/georgia-senate-runoffs-ad-spending-half-billion-dollars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least $500 million</a> worth!) and ensured that turnout would be high. Plus, then-President Donald Trump actively discouraged Republicans from trusting the state’s electoral system, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/turnout-dip-among-georgia-republicans-flipped-us-senate/IKWGEGFEEVEZ5DXTP7ZXXOROIA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which dissuaded many Republicans</a> from returning to the ballot box.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The change in 2021 can, in part, be attributed to the fact that Democrats were helped by Republicans,” Bullock said. On top of that, he added, prominent conservatives were <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-the-georgia-based-conspiracy-that-could-cost-loeffler-perdue-on-election-day/RME7ZMNFBZDYRPWS3IHG3QK7GE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discouraging GOP voters</a> from supporting both Loeffler and Perdue on the grounds that neither was reportedly doing enough to support Trump. “Some Republicans believed them, too,” Bullock said. “So it’s not so much that the two Democrats — Warnock and Ossoff — won, but that Republicans lost.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, however, things are looking better for Republicans. For one, the party is working a lot <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/top-republicans-rally-for-herschel-walker-in-ailing-georgia-senate-bid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder at voter mobilization</a> than it did two years ago; the midterm environment favors the GOP more so than it did in 2020, too, despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walker’s flaws as a candidate</a>. And the Peach State <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still leans red</a>, giving Republicans an additional boost.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Herschel Walker has got more skeletons than he’s got closets to hide them in. And if you’re looking for a reason to vote against Herschel, the reasons are out there,” Bullock said. “But Republican [voters] might have no problems overlooking his behavior if it means that Republicans can win control of the Senate.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, the Senate isn’t <em>all</em> we’re watching in the Peach State. While <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happened-to-stacey-abrams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ll also keep an eye</a> on the gubernatorial rematch between Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast</a> predicts that Kemp has more than a 9-in-10 chance of being reelected, so it’s unlikely this race will be as tight. In that sense, Warnock may be overperforming given the headwinds against Democrats this year. “At least maybe in a midterm year — especially one with a Democratic president and high inflation rates — you’d probably rather be a Republican running in Georgia than a Democrat,” Bullock said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, the Senate race was probably <em>always </em>going to be competitive <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-battlegrounds-georgia-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the outcome could determine</a> which party controls the upper chamber — giving voters an extra reason to turn out. We’ll find out soon how much those stakes motivate both party’s voters. And in the meantime, us election-watchers will keep our calendars open for December. If a runoff were to happen this year, early voting would start Nov. 14 — a mere week after Election Day. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Nathaniel Rakich contributed research.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Nov. 3, 2022, 10:05 a.m.):</strong> A previous version of this story suggested that if neither Warnock nor Walker got the most votes, they would have a second chance to win. This phrasing suggested that the third-party candidate in the race would get the most votes, which is extremely unlikely. It is more a matter of whether Warnock or Walker gets a majority of the overall vote.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">With just five days until Election Day, Republicans are in good shape in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>. If each party were to win every race they are currently favored to win, Republicans would have 51 Senate seats and Democrats would have 49, according to our Deluxe forecast as of Wednesday at 3 p.m. Eastern.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All data in this article is as of this same date and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> And if the same thing happened in the House, Republicans would win 225 seats and Democrats would win 210.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But those gains would be modest by the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standards of midterm elections</a>. In other words, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast, this likely won’t be a “red-wave” election like 2010 (when Republicans picked up 63 House seats) or 2014 (when Republicans picked up nine Senate seats). Instead, it’s looking like more of a “red ripple.” But that doesn’t mean a red wave is impossible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our forecast emphasizes probabilities, not binary outcomes: Democrats and Republicans are only <em>slightly</em> favored to win many of those seats, and a seat with a 60-in-100 chance of going blue votes Republican 40 out of 100 times. As readers of FiveThirtyEight are undoubtedly aware, it’s not unusual for polls to be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few percentage points off the final mark</a> (this is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal</a> and just a reality of our uncertain world). Since 1998, polls of U.S. Senate elections conducted within three weeks of Election Day have had a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted-average error of 5.4 percentage points</a>, and polls of U.S. House elections have had a weighted-average error of 6.3 points.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We calculate polling error by taking the difference between the poll’s margin and the actual election-result margin. So if a poll gave the Democrat a 2-point lead, but they won by 5 points, the poll had a 3-point error. (“Weighted” means that we gave less weight to polls conducted by especially prolific pollsters, so those pollsters don’t have an outsized influence on the average.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2016 and 2020 elections, polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-werent-great-but-thats-pretty-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famously underestimated Republicans</a>. If pollsters didn’t address the factors that caused this (which are <a href="https://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/MainSiteFiles/AAPOR-Task-Force-on-2020-Pre-Election-Polling_Report-FNL_embargo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still up for debate</a>), that could happen again. On the other hand, our research has found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-are-all-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can’t predict the direction of polling error in advance</a>. Historically, polls have been equally likely to underestimate Republicans or Democrats. So it’s also possible that pollsters have fixed the problems that plagued them in 2016 and 2020 — maybe even overcorrected for them — and that the current polls are too <em>good</em> for the GOP. In other words, a wide range of scenarios is possible in this election: everything from a Republican landslide to a world where Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/52-senators-filibuster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold the House and gain seats in the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To illustrate this, let’s look at what would happen if there was a normal polling error in favor of either Republicans or Democrats. Of course, in real life, the polling error will be different in every race. But, hypothetically, let’s say that Republicans do 5.4 points better than their current FiveThirtyEight-projected vote margins in every Senate race and 6.3 points better in every House race. This roughly happened in 2020, when polls underestimated the GOP by a record amount. In this scenario, Republicans would win 54 Senate seats. Pennsylvania, Arizona and New Hampshire would fall to the GOP.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in the House, Republicans would win 259 seats in this hypothetical scenario — a 46-seat gain.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes Alaska’s at-large district, where Democratic Rep.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> Democrats would lose several districts that <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for President Biden by double digits</a>, including New York’s 4th and California’s 9th, as well as several big-name incumbents, such as Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Katie Porter and Henry Cuellar. Even though no one is really talking about the possibility that Democrats will lose these seats, this list below shouldn’t be startling: Most of these districts have a less than 75-in-100 chance of going blue.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But again, we shouldn’t discount the possibility that polls will underestimate Democrats. So what would the election results look like if Democrats did 5.4 points better than the FiveThirtyEight forecast currently predicts in every Senate race and 6.3 points better in every House race? In this scenario, it would be Democrats who win 54 Senate seats — the ones in which they are currently favored plus Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And in the House, Democrats would win 227 seats, while Republicans would win 208. In other words, Democrats would <em>gain</em> seats in the lower chamber, something the president’s party has done only twice since World War II.

<p data-paragraph="main">To emphasize again, these are all hypothetical scenarios. If there is a pro-Republican or pro-Democratic polling error, it will almost surely unfold differently. Hopefully, though, this thought exercise has recalibrated your expectations. Of course, the polls could also be extremely accurate — as they were in the 2018 midterm. But you should be mentally prepared for something resembling the above scenarios too.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank">midterms forecast</a> continues to show Democrats and Republicans in a dead heat Senate race, with Republicans taking a very slight advantage. Recent polls have sent some contradictory messages, but the long and short of it is that seven races are now separated by three points or less polling average.

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans reached a milestone on Tuesday, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing a 50 percent chance of a Senate takeover</a> in our Deluxe forecast for the first time since July 25. Still, the race for the Senate is about as close as it gets. So I thought it might be worth engaging in a dialog with my alter egos.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, you’ll meet Nathan Redd. He’ll try to convince me that the Republican outlook is even better than our model shows. Then later this week, we’ll introduce you to Nathaniel Bleu.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, he spells his last name the &lt;a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/bleu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;French way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>24</sup></a> While fairly partisan, Redd and Bleu are canny observers of politics who are reasonably numerate. Last night, I met with Redd at a bar near Grand Central Station before his commute back to Connecticut. An abridged transcript follows:</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You’ve gotta be the luckiest guy I know, Silver.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Wait, what? What are you talking about? How are the kids, by the way? It’s been a while.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Luckiest guy I know. This is the easiest election call I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Well, we’re not really making “calls” at FiveThirtyEight, exactly. You know how the model works. It’s probabilistic. And the model says the Senate is about as close to 50-50 as it gets.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You think it’s 50-50? OK, let’s bet then. Steak. Sushi. Rangers tickets. You name it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> You haven’t even told me which side you want to bet on! Though I think I can guess.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> To me there are two scenarios: Republicans win big or Republicans win small.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Shocker.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> I’m telling you, this one is easy. Just look around you. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> It looks like … an Irish bar in Midtown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>It’s half-empty. And yet, the waitress hasn’t been to our table in 15 minutes. Welcome to Joe Biden’s America!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>So, you’re voting Republican because you can’t get your drink refilled?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> I mean, <em>just look</em>. It’s not back to normal. This place used to be packed from 5 p.m. ’til close. Now, they don’t even stay open past 10. Then there’s all the crime, the homelessness. There’s the inflation and the supply chain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’ll take you out to Brooklyn next time. It might as well be 2019 there. And when was the last time you closed out a bar? You moved to Connecticut when you were 23 and single.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>You’re getting off-track. The equation is pretty simple. The Democrat Party promised normal. They’re in charge of everything. We haven’t even gotten close to normal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Are we really saying “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(epithet)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrat Party”</a> now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You’re dodging, Silver. I know the numbers. People are <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with how things are going</a>. They’re <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with Biden</a>. Democrats barely even have a majority to begin with and there’s a backlash every midterm election.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republican-polls-affect-model-fivethirtyeight-92562557</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I get that, but it’s not so straightforward. Voters may be unhappy, but they’re <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agnostic about which party they prefer</a>. They remember former President Donald Trump, who <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t leave office as a popular guy</a>. They care about the Supreme Court, which exercises a lot of power even when Republicans are out of office. Have you talked to any of your female friends about abortion?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I don’t trust the polls anyway. C’mon. I read your stuff, believe it or not. I know your <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argument</a> about how it’s hard to predict polling bias. I sort of get it. But let’s do a little thought experiment. Let’s say it’s France, where they ban you from doing polling —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> You can do polls in France! Except for the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20170506-france-media-rules-prohibit-election-coverage-over-weekend-presidential-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekend before the election</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Silver, this is a thought experiment! Let’s say you’ve got no polls. What does your model say?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Well, it’s not exactly set up to run like that. But if what you’re getting at is Republicans are pretty heavily favored on the basis of the fundamentals, then I agree. At the start of the year, I was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expecting this to be an anticlimax</a> — Republicans would win both chambers of Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>That’s exactly what I’m getting at. I’m not even saying polls will always have a Democratic bias. I’m just saying in <em>this</em> election they will, because if you look at everything <em>apart</em> from the polls, it points toward a big Republican year. And the less you trust the polls, the more you need to look at everything else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’m not even sure that’s true. Democrats are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/democratic-fundraising-skyrockets-key-senate-races-rcna51059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising as much or more money than Republicans</a>. They did <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awfully well in those special elections</a> this summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Summer? Who cares about summer? The Trump guys I know, they don’t vote in the summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> So now you’re back to making assertions based on imaginary friends of yours?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> And by the way, I do talk to my female friends about abortion. Abortion is a problem for Republicans. That’s why I’m not sure if we’re going to win small or win big. But pretty much everything else lines up on our side.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I don’t see how you can be so confident about all of this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’m not confident! I just told you, I don’t know if we’re going to win small or big. But lately I’ve been thinking big. You want to know why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’m sure you’re going to tell me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>You know my favorite saying? Follow the outfielders, not the ball. When Aaron Judge hits a fly ball, look at what the left fielder is doing. Don’t listen to the crowd, they’re a bunch of idiots. Look at the professionals. The professionals are backing way up, like it’s going to be a big year for Republicans. Look where the campaigns are spending. For Democrats, it’s in blue districts. They have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/31/democrats-rush-aid-to-deep-blue-seat-in-upstate-new-york-00064258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems in New York</a>. I’m going to ask you about my boy and future New York governor Lee Zeldin in a minute, by the way. They have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/more-house-races-shift-in-gop-favor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trouble in California</a>. They’re even <a href="https://www.local10.com/vote-2022/2022/11/01/biden-headed-to-south-florida-to-campaign-1-week-before-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sending Biden to Miami-Dade County</a>!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>For a guy who’s as cynical about the media as you are, you’re awfully willing to buy into cherry-picked narratives. I don’t see how there’s any information given away by Biden visiting South Florida, for instance — it’s a swingy part of the country! And midterm elections can be regional. For every Lee Zeldin, you’ve got an Oklahoma, where the race is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oklahoma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprisingly tight in the other direction</a>. And by the way, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-had-a-superior-electoral-college-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professionals aren’t always so smart</a>. They’re just as much in the fog of war as anyone else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’m just saying, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occam’s razor</a>, Republicans win this thing. Keep it simple.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Occam’s razor? Where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=occams+razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have I heard that before</a>? But here’s the thing: I’m not actually sure that keeping it simple is better. There’s a reason we go through the trouble of building a model and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the extra work that entails</a>. I’m not sure that people’s intuitions are very good when it comes to election forecasting. In 2012, the media <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-campaign-idUKBRE8A30HP20121104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisted that the race was a toss-up</a> because they were looking at national polls, not realizing that former President Barack Obama had a pretty big edge in the Electoral College. In 2016, they didn’t realize how fragile Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s lead was because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlated errors between the states</a>. They kept it simple and they were wrong! Sometimes the devil is in the details!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’ll tell you a detail. Your <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> still has Democratic John Fetterman up in Pennsylvania’s Senate race. He’s not going to win after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/us/politics/fetterman-debate-pennsylvania-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that debate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Ahead? I mean, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just barely</a>. And it’s still not <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-voters-are-reacting-to-fettermans-debate-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entirely clear how much the debate changed things</a>. But I agree with you in principle: if there’s news that hasn’t yet been fully reflected in the polls, that’s going to make our model a lagging indicator.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>And I tell you who <em>else </em>is going to win: my boy Lee Zeldin. People are sick of Kathy Hochul. Maybe you need to step out of your media bubble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Your boy? Do you actually know him? You live in Greenwich, Connecticut, not New York. Who’s living in the bubble? And he’s probably not going to win. Hochul’s still <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahead in the polls</a>. And by the way, this cuts against everything you were saying earlier about the fundamentals. Even if Republicans are having a pretty good night, we’re living in very partisan times — it’s hard to win as a Republican in New York these days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>So, we got a bet?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>You on Zeldin, me on Hochul? Sure. Winner picks the restaurant and the wine, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>No, on the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m going to pass. Our model has it at 50-50, it’s been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-is-a-toss-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trending Republican</a>, and you make a couple of semi-persuasive points, like about Pennsylvania. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>Semi-persuasive! That’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me, Silver! And good luck on Tuesday, but you won’t need it. It’s going to be an early night.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Two years after helping <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliver President Biden the presidency</a>, and four years after decisively handing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control of the House of Representatives</a> to the Democratic Party, Americans living in the suburbs are poised to once again play a major role in an election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after Democrats got the upper hand in suburban areas in 2018 and 2020, the pendulum looks set to swing back in the GOP’s direction in 2022 — at least to some extent. Most of the House races that will decide the election will take place in suburban and exurban districts: About 7 in 10 House races viewed as at least somewhat competitive — those not rated as solidly Democratic or Republican — are in predominantly suburban districts, according to in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the Deluxe forecast, as of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern. Forecast ratings are based on win probabilities: Solid Democratic/Republican means a party’s chance of winning is 95 percent or better; likely Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 75 and 95 percent; lean Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 60 and 75 percent; and toss-up means each party has less than a 60 percent chance of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> And Republicans, with better than a 4-in-5 shot of winning control of the House, according to the forecast, appear well-positioned to win a sufficient number of those seats to capture a majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To identify which seats are predominantly suburban, we categorized all 435 House districts using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>, which measures how urban or rural a district is.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight&amp;#8217;s urbanization index for congressional districts is the natural logarithm of the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract in a given district, based on a weighted average of the population of each census tract. The population of a census tract is according to 2020 census data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> To help delineate the categories, we also considered the share of the population in each district that lives in places defined as rural, exurban or small town, suburban or small city, and urban core or large city.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is based on the population of surrounding census tracts. We define rural as having fewer than 25,000 people living within a five-mile radius of a census tract; exurban or small town as having between 25,000 and 99,999; suburban or small city as having between 100,000 and 249,999 people; and urban core or large city as having 250,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> Using this information, we formulated six groupings that range from most dense to least dense: Dense Urban, Urban-Suburban, Dense Suburban, Suburban-Exurban, Rural-Exurban and Mostly Rural.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dense Urban seats have an urbanization index of 13 or higher; Urban-Suburban from 12.5 up to 13; Dense Suburban from 11.5 up to 12.5; Suburban-Exurban from 10.5 up to 11.5; Rural-Exurban from 9.5 up to 10.5; and Mostly Rural below 9.5. While we do not use their exact methodology, we owe a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-20/citylab-s-congressional-density-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;debt of inspiration to CityLab&lt;/a&gt;, which released its helpful &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-05/the-suburbs-are-the-midterm-election-battleground" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Congressional Density Index&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 2018 midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>24</sup></a></p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republican-polls-affect-model-fivethirtyeight-92562557</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">About half the districts in the House are categorized as Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban, which we would expect given that more of the nation’s population <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/u-s-is-majority-suburban-but-doesn-t-define-suburb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lives in suburban areas</a> compared with urban or rural ones. And in line with the higher level of electoral competitiveness in suburban and exurban areas, the average seat in these categories is notably less blue or red than its more urban or rural counterparts.</p>

Dense Urban seats have an urbanization index of 13 or higher; Urban-Suburban from 12.5 to 13; Dense Suburban from 11.5 to 12.5; Suburban-Exurban from 10.5 to 11.5; Rural-Exurban from 9.5 to 10.5; and Mostly Rural below 9.5. Population data is taken from the 2020 census.</p>
 <p>The average-per-category columns reflect the average share of each district’s population that lives in census tracts defined as rural, exurban or small town, suburban or small city, or urban core or large city, which are categorized as follows: Rural has fewer than 25,000 people living within a five-mile radius of a census tract; exurban or small town as having between 25,000 and 99,999; suburban or small city as having between 100,000 and 249,999 people; and urban core or large city as having 250,000 or more.</p>
 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s forecast rates 75 districts as at least marginally competitive; of those, 53 are either Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban. (All data in this article is as of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.) As things stand, the suburban seats that are rated as lean or likely GOP would get Republicans to 211 seats when combining that with races that are rated Solid Republican, and winning most of the toss-up districts in those groupings would then put them over the top. Tellingly, of the 15 seats that have at least a 2 percent chance in our forecast of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-tipping-point-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being the “tipping-point” district</a> — that is, the decisive 218th seat for a party’s House majority — 12 are either Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban districts. Republicans are favored to some extent in nine of them, although not a lock to win any.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But that seat-by-seat count likely underestimates the GOP’s potential to capture suburban seats because the results in each district on Nov. 8 will not be <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/probability-independent-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent of each other</a>. That is, the swing to the right (or, less likely, the left) in a few districts <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will probably signal</a> at least some shift in the same direction elsewhere. In our forecast’s simulations, the average outcome is 230 Republican seats, seven more seats than we get when we simply assign each seat to the party with the highest win probability. That’s because if Republicans win some of the swingiest seats where Democrats currently hold a slim edge, other highly competitive seats may also swing to the right. This is a reasonably likely outcome, too, considering the GOP now has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight lead in the generic ballot</a> that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could grow by Election Day</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s take a brief look at some of the key districts in each category. </p>



<h2><strong>Suburban-Exurban districts</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thirty-three of the 53 competitive suburban races are in districts classified as Suburban-Exurban. Overall, 11 of these seats are either toss-ups or favor the GOP to some extent. At the forefront of that group is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa’s 3rd District</a>, a slightly right-leaning seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/iowa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that includes Des Moines</a>, which is the most likely tipping-point district in our forecast. Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne is defending this seat, but she appears to be a slight underdog. On the East Coast, three other light-red seats held by Democrats are also under threat. Reps. Elaine Luria and Susan Wild each have about a 50-50 chance of retaining <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/virginia/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s 2nd District</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 7th District</a>, respectively, while Rep. Tom Malinowski is trailing in his reelection race in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-jersey/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey’s 7th District</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This group also includes a couple of toss-up races along the U.S.-Mexico border in South Texas, where Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-republican-gains-in-south-texas-win-them-more-house-seats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hope to build</a> on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gains they made in the region</a> in 2020. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s 34th District</a>, the incumbent-versus-incumbent contest between Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez and Republican Rep. Mayra Flores appears up in the air despite the district’s fairly strong (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on paper</a> at least) Democratic lean. There’s also a toss-up contest next door in the purple <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15th District</a>, although the Republican trend there might make this seat <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/24/tx15-vallejo-de-la-cruz-2022-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the GOP’s better pickup opportunities</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats do hold at least a small edge in 22 of these Suburban-Exurban seats, yet while almost all of these are being defended by Democratic incumbents, there are some juicy targets for Republicans. This group includes some light-blue seats in the northeast, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 17th District</a>, where Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/27/maloney-dems-new-york-midterms-00063645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is at risk</a> of being the first chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to lose reelection <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1584524155809996800?s=20&amp;t=79UbkR1fKrxQJVbJF2kxGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1980</a>. But it also includes a couple red-leaning Rust Belt seats, such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 8th District</a>, where Rep. Matt Cartwright is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to defy gravity</a> as northeast Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/us/politics/blue-collar-voters-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shifted more Republican</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Dense Suburban</strong> districts</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also 20 competitive races happening in the Dense Suburban category, including three toss-ups. Among that trio, Republicans are looking to flip two notable open seats: the bluest seat on their radar, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/rhode-island/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island’s 2nd District</a>, and swingy suburban Pittsburgh turf in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 17th District</a>. But in the other toss-up race, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan’s 3rd District</a>, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-spent-loads-boosting-republicans-they-thought-were-less-electable-will-it-pay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have made it harder</a> on themselves <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by ousting</a> GOP Rep. Peter Meijer in the primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ten of those competitive seats currently advantage the GOP, including California’s blue-leaning but Republican-held <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27th District</a>, which major outside Democratic groups <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1583489245708423168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently decided to abandon by cutting their ad spending</a>. And as the GOP’s chances have improved in the House, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two purple seats</a> in Ohio where Republicans are favored are now the second- and seventh-most likely tipping-point seats in our forecast: In the Cincinnati-based <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1st District</a>, Republican Rep. Steve Chabot is likely to win, while Republicans look to have a similar edge in the open, Akron-based <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13th District</a> south of Cleveland.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, Democrats are favored in seven competitive seats in the Dense Suburban category, although some could still get picked off if the GOP has a good night. The open seat in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 3rd District</a> may be most in danger, as the Long Island-based seat is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a light-blue seat</a>. But Democrats also need to defend <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/kansas/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas’s 3rd District</a>, a red-tinged seat in Kansas City’s suburbs, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/27/upshot/times-siena-toplines-house-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite some recent strong polling</a> for Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, neither party views the race as a done deal based on <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article267423067.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside spending</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The suburbs make up a big chunk of the districts in the House of Representatives — and the lion’s share of the districts that will be most contested on Election Day. Republicans are favored to win the House, and should they capture a majority, there’s a high likelihood that their gains in seats in the Dense Suburban and Suburban-Exurban groupings will have played a starring role in that outcome.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Sergio Piedra, 51, remembers when “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105323610/flight-tickets-inflation-pandemic-revenge-travel-vacation-europe-recession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revenge travel</a>” — or traveling to make up for lost time during the COVID-19 pandemic — was at an all-time high. But after an initial influx of out-of-towners to his home state of Florida, Piedra, who works for a local tourism marketing organization, began to notice a slight dip in visitors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is how I make a living,” he told me. “So it’s important to me that people are willing to travel.” And right now, ahead of the winter holiday season, he’s especially on edge. “It’s important to me that people are willing to travel, spend money and have a good time.” As concerns about the economy mount, however, it’s unclear whether that’ll be the case. While bookings and vacations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/travel/trends-spring-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to increase</a> throughout the United States this past spring, <a href="https://business.fau.edu/newsroom/press-releases/2022/florida-travel-slowdown.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ve since declined</a>. It <em>does </em>look like people will be traveling for the holidays — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-save-on-holiday-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but it won’t be cheap</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-concerned-inflation-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-92497861</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra, who identifies as a Democrat, understands that other Americans may be worse off — both he and his wife are still employed — but the U.S. economy is still a top concern for him. And he’s far from being alone: The latest wave of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos</a> poll using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a> found that “inflation or increasing costs” was top of mind for most Americans. (According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ipsos-preelection-survey-likely-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest survey data</a>, 65 percent of Americans said that issue was among the most important facing the country.) </p>

In some cases, like Piedra’s, those fears haven’t stopped them from supporting Democrats. But other voters of color I spoke with said that, despite their political affiliation, they currently trust the GOP more on issues related to the economy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was the case with James Harris, 23, who lives in California and identifies as an independent voter. In fact, Harris told me that he hopes the next Congress is gridlocked so that there’s more compromise in D.C. — something he’s optimistic will lead to more bipartisan solutions when it comes to addressing the country’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/06/7-top-economic-minds-think-global-recession-coming-some-say-its-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current economic problems</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you have Republicans in the House, Democrats in the Senate and then [President] Biden in White House, there’s going to <em>have </em>to be compromise,” he said. “While Democrats might want to pass more ambitious bills that carry a steep price tag, Republicans aren’t going to want to increase spending. And, in the end, I think that might be a healthy balance.” (The Deluxe version of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a> currently favors Republicans to win the House, while the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate is a dead heat</a>.) </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As Harris and Piedra’s differing stances show, voters of color have competing views when it comes to what they’re most worried about regarding the economy <em>and </em>what they want the federal government to do about it. Despite my interviewees’ fears about the economy, though, not everyone viewed increased federal spending — such as Biden’s <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/debt-relief-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">student loan forgiveness initiative</a> or the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/biden-1point9-trillion-covid-relief-package-thursday-afternoon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 stimulus checks</a> — as a bad<em> </em>thing. “I’m for them,” said 45-year-old Beth Napper, “not because I necessarily think they help the economy as a whole, but because I think they help <em>individuals</em> who are impacted by the economy that we’re in.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><hr><span></span></div>
 



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: How much is the economy factoring into your voting decision in this election cycle? Is it more of a factor than it usually is or about the same? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beth Napper (45, Virginia, Black, Democrat): Economic concerns comprise at least 60 percent of my decision for voting in this year’s midterm election, which is more than usual. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sergio Piedra (51, Florida, Hispanic, Democrat): I work in the tourism industry, so I can always feel the ebb and flow of the economy. I’ve been lucky enough to maintain a job [throughout the pandemic], but I understand that many others are struggling and I sympathize with that. When I go to the voting booth, concerns about the economy will be top of mind — but they always are for me. It won’t be any greater or less this year. Statistically, how the economy is doing comprises about 50 percent in how I decide who I vote for; the other 50 percent is a bunch of other things. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">James Harris (23, California, Hispanic and white, independent): I’ve never voted before, but the economy, in my opinion, is the most important issue for my family and me this year. I know that the unemployment rate is low right now, but, because of inflation, I think that confidence in the economy is very low, too. Right now, I’m worried about gas prices and the uncertainty of how things will go. I currently work two jobs — a night job and a day job — not because I’m living paycheck to paycheck, but because expenses are going up and I want to prepare for a possible recession next year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Zachary Bimslager (43, Texas, Black and white, Libertarian): It’s hard to quantify exactly how much the economy factors into my vote this year. It’s definitely the most important factor, but I wouldn’t say that it’s more or less important than it has been in any other election. The economy is always my No. 1 issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maya Kannan (19, Texas, Asian, Republican): This is the first election that I’ll be voting in, actually, but if I were to give a percentage, I’d say that the economy comprises about 40 percent of my voting decisions this year. It’s definitely my top issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What are you most worried about regarding the economy? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’m worried about people worrying about the economy. It almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, you know: Things are bad, but it gets made worse if everyone is thinking about the worst possible outcome. I don’t mean to say that everyone needs to be as optimistic as I am, but we’ve been through so much as a country in the last few years and we’re still standing. We just need to keep moving forward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: The impact of inflation and how long it will continue to ramp up. And while this doesn’t impact me directly, the trend toward a gig economy is something I’ve seen and heard more about from my friends, and I don’t think that’s sustainable for the average person to take them through their working life and into retirement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: A lot of news outlets are predicting that we’re going to be in a recession next year, and I’m really nervous to see how things will turn out. My fear is that the people who will be most affected by a potential recession are retail workers or people who are just entering the workforce. I’m also worried about how high the unemployment rate will rise <em>if </em>we go into a recession.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: Obviously, the elephant in the room is inflation. While I’m also concerned about things like employment numbers, too, inflation is the top economic issue that I’m concerned about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have you swung back and forth in terms of the economic issues you’ve cared about most in 2022?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: The whole gas price shock threw me for a loop. At one point I was thinking, ‘Man, how high can these prices go?’ But I think I’ve reeled back from that as things have stabilized — relatively speaking — into the summer and fall. I don’t want to sound self-serving, but as we enter the holiday season, I’ve been thinking more about the impact the economy has on the tourism industry and whether people are going to get back to leisure traveling. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: No, I don’t think so. I feel like the same issues have been prevalent throughout all of 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Yes, certainly. At the beginning of the year, unemployment was my top concern. I saw a number of people lose jobs and that started to scare me. Later on, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising gas prices became my biggest worry. Then, once inflation got out of hand, that became a bigger deal to me over energy prices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have your own personal finances — or your general financial situation — changed in the last few years?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: Not really, no. It has been steady. I’ve been through worse situations. For example, during the Great Recession, I didn’t get a pay raise for five years. But my wife and I have continued to work, receive pay increases and pay our bills — so that has been good.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Before I moved to San Francisco, I was living in Indianapolis, where I went to school and graduated May 2022. While I was there, though, I didn’t own a car and would borrow my friend’s. Whenever I had to fill up the gas tank, it would be about $30, but, month by month, that increased and eventually it got closer to $50. I started noticing how much more I was paying in gas starting in summer 2021 compared to years prior. And throughout the year until now, it has gotten worse. Those small expenses that you have to do on a daily or weekly basis — like buying groceries or getting gas — add up, and it puts me in a hard position because I’ve had to sacrifice some of my wants to pay for these things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: No. I’ve been employed by the same company for a very long time, so our salaries haven’t really been affected by issues with the economy. As a consumer, my buying power is down with the current inflation rates, but it hasn’t been <em>too</em> drastic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Who do you think is responsible for your current financial situation?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: Myself. There’s a lot of factors that I can’t control — whether it’s the government or how many people are traveling at any given time — but, at the end of the day, you still have to work and make the right decisions economically. So, in a sense, I feel like I’m the one most responsible for what happens to me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: In all honesty, part of it is on me. I know that I need to budget better and probably not do things like buy coffee in the morning or order Ubers. But I think the primary reason why the economy is in the position that it’s in is due to supply shortages all around the world. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: Ultimately, I am, but in a political context, I’d say that both parties are responsible. At any given point in time, I’d blame the political party in power, but I do think that both Democrats and Republicans make the same mistakes regarding the economy — particularly when it comes to federal spending. This is a systemic issue, though, so I wouldn’t necessarily blame neither Biden nor [former President Donald] Trump for where we are today. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: I think that a lot rests on the previous president. While there was a lot of economic growth under the Trump administration, the beginning of certain spending expenditures that ultimately led to the economic issues we have now started with him. I also think you could argue that Trump wasn’t tough enough on Russia, and, if he were, that may have prevented some of the issues we’re facing now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you more concerned about your own financial situation or the country’s?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: The country’s. But what I’m really worried about is the middle class. What I’ve observed and heard in conversations with friends, families and the various communities I’m a part of is a concern for whether our country’s current economic situation is sustainable; and if it’s not, I’m worried about what the ripple effects of that will be. Will that mean higher taxes? More inflation? Those are all major concerns of mine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: The country’s. I have a budget and try to follow it as closely as I can, but I am really worried about the country’s economy because if it isn’t in good shape, then unemployment will eventually go up. I’m also worried about job security — not just for my own sake, but for other Americans and my family members, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Definitely the country’s. Thankfully, my father is very established in his career and I’m pursuing a degree that has promising job prospects, so I’m not overly concerned about my own finances. That said, there’s definitely reason to suspect that many people in the U.S. are going to suffer from this period we’re in now. Inflation affects things like tuition, but a lot of jobs still require a college degree. And if more people forego a college education as a result, that could impact their future income. Certainly, the situation we’re in now is going to have long-term, negative effects for a very large swath of people in the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do you think recent federal spending initiatives have contributed to rising inflation? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I think so, but I also believe these things needed to be done for the good of the country. For every action, there’s going to be a reaction. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: Yes, but I support most of those initiatives. And while they’ve contributed to inflation, they’re by no means, at least in my mind, the root cause of what we’re seeing today. I think that the economic situation we’re in now has been in the works for some time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Absolutely. While I supported initiatives like the American Rescue Plan, I think the federal government also overspent during that time. And I’ve seen a lot of articles about PPP money getting stolen, so I wish that we would’ve spent less during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: To a certain degree, but I wouldn’t blame them for everything we’re seeing now. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the country’s economic downturn, too. Of course, a certain amount of inflation is inevitable, and I think some federal spending initiatives — from both the Biden and Trump administrations — were wasteful, but I wouldn’t necessarily blame only the most <em>recent</em> ones for everything we’re seeing now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you for or against recent Biden administration proposals and policies that have or will affect the economy — such as the COVID-19 stimulus checks or forgiving some student loan debt?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’m mostly for the things that [Biden] is doing. I may not agree with everything, but you have to give the man a shot at trying. The idea is to come up with something different from the previous administrations, and I want to see how that plays out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: I didn’t receive any stimulus money because, at the time, I was still dependent on my parents. While I think a lot of people needed the money, and I supported giving COVID-19 stimulus checks to individuals, I believe that the way it was rolled out was ineffective because there was a lot of fraud. And, to be honest, I don’t support Biden’s student loan debt initiative because the cost of universities is still going to go up, and, 10 years from now, we’re still going to have people in debt. Even though a lot of people will be helped by loan forgiveness, [the initiative] still doesn’t address the underlying issue of why college tuition is increasing and how we can bring a stop to that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: I’m not necessarily in favor of them primarily because I don’t think that a lot of these spending initiatives will lead to [Biden’s] desired outcome. For example, I don’t think that the Inflation Reduction Act will do much to curb inflation. That said, I’m not up in arms about these policies, either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Conceptually, I agreed with the stimulus checks. My family received them, but I don’t think we necessarily needed them — so some of the spending there might have been excessive. I also question whether the stimulus checks discouraged people from seeking employment during the labor shortage. And while I understand the sentiment behind the student loan initiative, I wonder if now was the best time to deploy that. It also doesn’t really solve the problem of unaffordable higher education. It’s a policy to win votes, but it doesn’t solve the underlying issues at hand. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What, if anything, do you hope the federal government will do to alleviate your concerns regarding the economy?  </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: I would like to see more bipartisan support for measures that really deal with what I think are the root causes of our current economic situation. In an ideal world, I would like to see our representatives fight for what’s right for individuals versus corporations. I think that a lot of people equate the strength of our economy to the strength of corporations and, as far as I can tell, our corporations are as strong — or stronger — than they’ve ever been. That’s happening, though, at the detriment of the individual. So I want more policies that focus on helping people. I can’t name anything specific that I’d like to see, but I want more of a shift in the mindset of our politicians. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: They just need to stop spending so much money in general. But I’d have that critique of any administration, regardless of party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: There needs to be more accountability and transparency about how federal money is being spent. It is important to get an explanation of how specific spending initiatives in the budget accomplish the government’s goals — say, improved welfare, greater security, economic growth, et cetera. I’m not saying that we need to spend less necessarily, but we need to know what’s supposed to happen with that money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Which party do you trust more on economic issues? Why? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’ll be loyal and say that I trust my party, the Democrats. I think with Democrats, there’s a degree of realism, but with Republicans, they just want to repeat the same tactic over and over again: Cut taxes here and allegedly cut spending there — and they never really do either well. Their economic messaging has become really tiresome to me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: At the moment, I don’t trust either party because I feel that everyone is more concerned with being reelected than the work that we elect them to do while they’re there. I hope that there are individuals who are not that way, but, on the whole, that’s how I view both parties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Honestly, neither of them. But if I had to choose right now, I’d say that I trust the Republicans more. Republicans want to bring taxes down, which I support. We also need to focus on bringing federal spending down, and I think that the Republicans are more cognizant about that. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: If you asked me this a few years ago, I would have said the Republican Party easily. But at the moment, the Democrats have a slight edge. That’s not to say that I fully trust them, but I think Republicans, unfortunately, given the current leadership, are not very good at determining which battles are worth fighting. When I was younger and first started identifying as Republican, politicians like Mitt Romney were quite content with globalization as a way of improving the standard of living. Trump, meanwhile, was ready to sacrifice standard of living just to counter globalization, which, to me, is not sound economic policy. </p>]]></description>
