<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday night, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473?nname=huddle&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b4be0000&amp;nrid=0000016a-6f07-d904-a77b-ff47e9d50000&amp;nlid=630309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico published</a> a draft opinion from the Supreme Court that indicates a five-justice conservative majority plans to strike down Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to abortion. It is not a final ruling, and it can change, but if it does not, the ruling would dramatically restrict abortion access across the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even before the leaked draft, state legislators weren’t waiting for the justices’ final word. For several months, lawmakers from each party have been acting as though the constitutional right to abortion is already gone. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research group that supports abortion rights, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/03/2022-state-legislative-sessions-abortion-bans-and-restrictions-medication-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">536 abortion restrictions were introduced in 42 states</a> between Jan. 1 and April 14 this year. Most haven’t become law, but some did make it through the legislative gauntlet: Nine states have enacted nearly three-dozen abortion restrictions, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/oklahoma-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a near-total ban</a> on abortion in Oklahoma, a ban on abortion after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/us/idaho-supreme-court-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about six weeks of pregnancy in Idaho</a> (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/4/29/23048887/oklahoma-abortion-ban-texas-six-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma passed one of those too</a>) and bans on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/arizona-governor-signs-15-week-abortion-ban-into-law-2022-03-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/kentucky-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-15-week-abortion/story?id=84055458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1084485963/florida-abortion-law-15-weeks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a>.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these bans have been temporarily blocked by the courts while legal challenges play out. And some laws have not yet gone into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

According to Guttmacher, seven states have enacted about a dozen abortion protections so far this year, with the goal of ensuring that abortions will remain accessible there, even if this summer the Supreme Court allows states to ban abortion.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="856" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/atd.state-abortion-legislation.2.png" alt="Maps of number and type of provisions that state legislatures have enacted in 2022 to protect or expand abortion access, as of May 3, 2022, at 12 p.m. Eastern.

States are racing to preempt and undermine each other’s legislation, resulting in a cascade of unorthodox proposals. Increasingly, in recent times, abortion laws in various states actively conflict with each other, foreshadowing the giant legal mess that will ensue if Roe is overturned. All of this means that if the Supreme Court’s conservative justices are hoping to wash their hands of abortion decisions by overruling Roe, they’re in for disappointment. Overturning Roe will unleash a new set of complicated legal battles that will bring the issue of abortion straight back to the high court. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Anti-abortion advocates are now grappling with the reality that outlawing abortion won’t entirely <em>end</em> abortion. Faced with the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing popularity of abortion pills</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/abortion-pills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawmakers in red states have passed a wave</a> of new restrictions on sending medication abortion through the mail as well as some outright bans on abortion pills. “I see these restrictions as trying to intimidate people away from using the internet for access to abortion care,” said <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/elizabeth-nash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Nash</a>, the interim associate director of state issues at Guttmacher. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortions performed in clinics remain a battleground, too. After Texas implemented a ban on abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy last September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/upshot/texas-abortion-women-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an analysis found</a> that the total number of abortions among Texas residents declined by only about 10 percent, because so many people were leaving the state to get an abortion or ordering abortion pills online to use on their own. Some blue states are trying to keep things that way. This year, <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/california/california-bill-would-provide-funding-to-help-pay-for-abortions-for-those-who-cant-afford/article_38cd70d8-a707-11ec-924f-6ff4e47ed6ae.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/03/2022-state-legislative-sessions-abortion-bans-and-restrictions-medication-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several other states</a> are considering using state funds to subsidize abortion costs for low-income people, including even those who live in other states. Other states, including Maryland, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/11/1091967163/abortion-rights-health-insurance-larry-hogan-maryland-veto-fetus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are taking steps</a> to make it possible for a wider range of health care providers to perform abortions, which will make it easier and cheaper to offer. <a href="https://ktvl.com/news/local/oregon-lawmakers-have-approved-15-million-for-expanded-abortion-access-laws-idaho-oregon-procedure-politics-republican-democrat-housebill-bills-governor-plannedparenthood-righttolife" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oregon legislature approved</a> $15 million in funding to help abortion providers scale up their facilities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this has turned into a complicated dance in which legislators on both sides of the aisle aren’t just trying to make it easier or harder to get an abortion in their state — they’re also trying to insulate their residents from what other states are doing. In Missouri, where anti-abortion legislators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/missouri-abortion-clinic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have already made it very difficult</a> to get an abortion, many pregnant people are already leaving the state to get abortions — a journey that was made much easier when Planned Parenthood opened <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-st-louis-region-southwest-missouri/who-we-are/press-releases/planned-parenthood-to-expand-abortion-access-at-new-state-of-the-art-center-in-southern-illinois" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a massive clinic</a> just across the state line, in Illinois. So Missouri state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a prominent anti-abortion legislator, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/19/travel-abortion-law-missouri-00018539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed a law</a> that would allow private citizens to sue out-of-state abortion providers who perform the procedure on Missouri residents, as well as anyone who aids a Missouri resident in getting an abortion. <a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/22info/pdf-bill/intro/SB1202.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another law introduced in Missouri</a> applies the state’s abortion laws to abortions performed on Missouri residents in different states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Neither of these Missouri laws has moved much in the legislature. But if Roe is overturned, other anti-abortion legislators in other states will likely consider similar measures. “You can imagine doctors or administrators or other health care providers thinking, ‘Can I care for this patient from Missouri, or am I at risk of being sued in a Missouri court?’” said <a href="https://drexel.edu/law/faculty/fulltime_fac/David%20Cohen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David S. Cohen</a>, a law professor at Drexel University. “That would have a chilling effect.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in blue states, abortion-rights supporters are already thinking about their next move. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/nyregion/connecticut-texas-abortion-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connecticut legislature recently passed a law</a> that would shield abortion providers who perform abortions on people who live in other states from being sued or prosecuted in states where abortion is illegal, and the governor has promised to sign it. <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2022/04/california-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> is considering a similar measure, and New York legislators also <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/abortion-new-york-texas-o5tma2v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced several bills</a> to protect abortion providers from extradition.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These laws could take the fight over abortion into head-spinningly complicated new territory. Since abortion was declared a constitutional right in 1973, the legal sparring over the procedure has never been simple — pretty much every aspect of the procedure has been litigated. But because it’s a federal constitutional right, there’s never been a question of whether a California abortion provider could be hauled into a Texas court to answer for a procedure they performed in California. In a post-Roe world, providers and people who help women get abortions will face a whole new set of risks. States like California could theoretically protect their providers from lawsuits and prosecution by instructing its own state courts to ignore a summons from a state like Texas. But unless other states were to do something similar, a state-versus-state situation like this would mean the provider couldn’t easily leave California — and they certainly couldn’t travel to the state where they were being sued.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This flurry of legislation is a tiny glimpse into the Pandora’s box that the Supreme Court will open if the justices do overturn Roe. It’s already clear that individual states will not be content to simply create their own abortion laws and apply them within their borders, and state laws that enable citizens to sue residents in other states over the procedure would create new and complicated legal battles that the Supreme Court will likely have to resolve. Anti-abortion advocates want to end the procedure across the country, and abortion-rights advocates want to stop them — which means that things could soon get even more chaotic.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Today, the midterm election season kicks off in earnest, with Indiana and Ohio holding their 2022 primaries. From now until July, there will be a primary every single week except one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These races may not get as much attention as the general election, but they are no less important, especially given that most states and districts will not be competitive in November. In many cases, the primaries will effectively decide who governs in 2023 and beyond. Even though the candidates in these races belong to the same party, there are often significant differences between them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, is the future of the Democratic Party on the left or in the center of the political spectrum? It will depend on whether progressives or moderates win more primaries. Similarly, will Republicans follow former President Donald Trump down a path of illiberalism, or will they return to their traditional conservative roots? It will depend on whether norm-breaking or norm-respecting candidates emerge victorious in GOP primaries.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we do every year, we at FiveThirtyEight will be covering these primaries with election-night <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blogs</a> and articles that preview the noteworthy races — articles like this one. We already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-primary-for-ohio-senate-will-be-a-test-for-trump-but-probably-a-win-for-trumpism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed Ohio’s high-profile U.S. Senate race</a> in an article on Monday, but that still leaves several less heralded but still important races to familiarize yourself with before polls close this evening. </p>



<h2><strong>Indiana</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st and 9th congressional districts<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 6 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 7 p.m. Eastern in the northwest and southwest corners</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polls close so early in Indiana that we’ll start getting results from the <strong>9th District</strong> before most of us have even sat down to dinner. Nine Republicans are squaring off for the right to succeed retiring Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, and the winner is all but assured of becoming the dark-red district’s next representative. Unlike many GOP primaries this year, though, the race hasn’t really been a referendum on Trumpism: The former president hasn’t endorsed in the race, and according to our research, the candidates have all avoided taking a firm position on Trump’s “Big Lie” (the idea the 2020 election was stolen).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, the main question is whether Republicans will take the opportunity to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-record-number-of-republican-women-will-and-wont-change-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase gender diversity in the party</a>. <a href="https://elevate-pac.com/candidate/erin-houchin-in-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-PAC</a> and the <a href="https://www.sba-list.org/newsroom/press-releases/sba-lists-candidate-fund-pac-endorses-erin-houchin-in-09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susan B. Anthony List</a>, two organizations that attempt to elect more GOP women, have both endorsed former state Sen. Erin Houchin, who is one of the race’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IN/09/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top fundraisers</a>. But two other male candidates <a href="https://www.newsandtribune.com/news/gop-rivals-crowd-field-for-open-indiana-congressional-seat/article_0228ee92-ba83-11ec-8363-b3899ec95851.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also look serious</a>. Former Rep. Mike Sodrel, who ran for this seat in five consecutive elections between 2002 and 2010, is seeking a political comeback at age 76. The wealthy business owner has loaned his own campaign <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IN09084/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$725,000</a> (a big sum for this race), but he has only one win to show for those five campaigns, and that was 18 years ago. Meanwhile, Army veteran Stu Barnes-Israel has also raised a significant amount of money and has the endorsements of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tom-cotton-stu-barnes-israel-endorsement-indiana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Tom Cotton</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/mike-pompeo-backs-army-veterans-indiana-house-bid-in-crowded-republican-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a>, who are both considered potential 2024 presidential candidates.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At 7 p.m. Eastern, we’ll start getting results from the GOP primary in the <strong>1st District</strong>, located in the suburbs of Chicago. Although seven Republicans are on the ballot, only two have reported <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IN/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising any money</a>: Air Force reservist Jennifer-Ruth Green ($304,521) and former LaPorte Mayor Blair Milo ($225,085). Green would be the only Black Republican woman in the House if she wins,<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless another is elected this year, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> while Milo would also add another woman to the GOP’s ranks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trumpism has played more of a role in this race. Green, for instance, has <a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/watch-now-green-blasts-milo-as-never-trump-liberal-in-republican-congressional-contest/article_f6b0a97e-a265-5afc-8302-c74cb7318146.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired negative ads</a> against Milo for being “never Trump” in 2016, while Milo has attacked Green for voting in the Democratic primary in 2018. That could <a href="https://www.shelbynews.com/news/state/watch-now-leyva-pledges-to-restore-trump-policies-if-northwest-indiana-sends-him-to-congress/article_8b6abbbb-1df7-5b6a-b329-b6757f99912a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide an opening</a> for a third candidate, who may actually have the most name recognition in the field: perennial candidate Mark Leyva, who was the GOP nominee for this seat in <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Mark_Leyva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014, 2018 and 2020</a>. That would probably be good news for the 1st District’s incumbent, Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan, who could be vulnerable in November if Republicans nominate a strong candidate (the district is only 7 percentage points bluer than the nation as a whole, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a><a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a>). That’s probably not Leyva, who lost all three of those campaigns and also underperformed Trump in the district in 2020.</p>



<h2><strong>Ohio</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>U.S. Senate; 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th congressional districts; governor; secretary of state<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7:30 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s marquee race is, of course, Ohio’s Republican primary for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong>. With the retirement of establishment-aligned Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio’s junior senator is likely about to get a whole lot Trumpier, but there’s no clear front-runner in this race; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-primary-for-ohio-senate-will-be-a-test-for-trump-but-probably-a-win-for-trumpism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read my preview from yesterday</a> for the full lowdown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other big statewide race is for <strong>governor</strong>. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is fairly popular in the state, but he did <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/25/trump-ohio-governorship-00001603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anger some conservatives</a> during his first term, first by imposing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-ohio-dewine-outbreak/2020/03/16/9bde6b1e-67b2-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong protective measures</a> against the coronavirus (<a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/12/31/mike-dewine-seemed-like-one-of-the-few-republicans-serious-about-fighting-covid-hes-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least at first</a>) and then by <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/11/days-after-a-winner-was-projected-mike-dewine-says-joe-biden-won-the-presidential-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledging the legitimacy</a> of the 2020 election (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/03/dewine-tapper-election-fraud-453821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least at first</a>). That prompted Trump himself <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/11/trump-takes-shot-at-ohio-gov-mike-dewine-says-in-tweet-his-upcoming-race-will-be-hotly-contested.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to tweet</a> in November 2020, “Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio? Will be hotly contested!” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But ultimately Trump hasn’t put his full weight behind ousting DeWine — he didn’t endorse any of the governor’s challengers — so the incumbent should benefit from a <a href="https://fox8.com/news/trump-doesnt-endorse-in-ohio-governor-primary-as-anti-dewine-vote-is-split/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divided opposition</a>. There are two significant challengers to keep an eye on, though: former Rep. Jim Renacci, who has ties to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/brad-parscale-advising-potential-primary-challenger-ohio-s-republican-governor-n1267132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s inner circle</a> and has self-funded <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/31/ohio-governor-dewine-raises-renacci-loans-and-democrats-duke-out/9201788002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $5 million</a>, and farmer Joe Blystone, who has garnered a <a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/politics/2022/04/24/joe-blystone-ohio-gubernatorial-race/stories/20220422144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprising amount of support</a> with his extreme stances on COVID-19 (he supports treating it with ivermectin), abortion (he wants a total ban) and race and sex education (he’s called it indoctrination). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">DeWine hasn’t taken his renomination for granted, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2021/12/in-2021-gov-mike-dewine-played-nicer-with-his-fellow-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governing more from the right since 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/04/gov-mike-dewine-still-considered-frontrunner-in-gop-race-for-ohio-governor-as-primary-nears.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending millions of dollars on TV ads</a>. It seems to have paid off, too, as a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/OH-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-April-20-24_release-April-26-....pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News poll</a> from April 20-24 gave him a wide lead with 43 percent, with Renacci (24 percent) and Blystone (19 percent) duking it out for second place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Provided DeWine wins the primary, he’ll probably coast to an easy reelection given his <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong approval ratings</a> and Ohio’s Republican lean. But if either Renacci or Blystone pulls off the upset, it could present an opening for the Democratic nominee — either former Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley or former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley. The two have similar biographies and <a href="https://www.wvxu.org/politics/2022-04-27/analysis-john-cranley-nan-whaley-aligned-issues-democratic-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy preferences</a> (they were even, until this campaign, <a href="https://www.wvxu.org/politics/2019-01-04/cincinnati-dayton-mayors-strike-a-friendship-and-start-a-movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close allies</a>), and they have even raised similar amounts of money. We really have no idea who’s favored in this race either: The <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bliss/docs/research/2022%20University%20of%20Akron%20Poll-v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> was conducted two months ago, and it gave Whaley 23 percent, Cranley 18 percent and “Undecided” 54 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Buckeye State also has several consequential House primaries worth keeping an eye on, including in two districts that could send a new Trump loyalist to Congress. In the <strong>7th District</strong>, Trump has <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/former-donald-trump-aide-max-miller-announces-gop-primary-bid-against-us-rep-anthony-gonzalez-claiming-endorsement-from-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> his former aide Max Miller, despite allegations that Miller <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/northeast-ohio-congressional-candidate-files-lawsuit-against-ex-girlfriend-abuse-allegations/95-72f3450e-d3c3-4bab-ac70-ddf49d108ff9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physically abused his ex-girlfriend</a> (Trump’s former press secretary, Stephanie Grisham). For a while, this looked like it would be a major test of Trump’s endorsement power, since Miller was running against incumbent Rep. Bob Gibbs. But in early April, Gibbs abruptly <a href="https://www.cantonrep.com/story/news/2022/04/06/congressman-bob-gibbs-retire/9482327002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out of the race</a>, saying he planned to retire. This likely paved the way for Miller to prevail in both the primary and, given the district’s red hue, the general election too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the GOP primary for Ohio’s <strong>13th District</strong>,<strong> </strong>Trump’s pick also seems likely to emerge victorious. Attorney Madison Gesiotto Gilbert, who has not only <a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2022/03/15/trump-backs-gesiotto-gilbert-ohio-13-th-congressional-district/7055850001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> but also <a href="https://elevate-pac.com/candidate/madison-gesiotto-gilbert-oh-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-PAC’s</a>, has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH09163/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$615,572</a> for the race, while the next-strongest fundraiser, attorney Greg Wheeler, has pulled in just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OH13256/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$173,263</a>. But the general election against state House Minority Leader Emilia Sykes, who is unopposed in the Democratic Party, could be competitive: The seat has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of just R+2.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump hasn’t weighed in on the <strong>9th District</strong>, but its GOP primary offers one of the starkest contrasts of any of today’s races — and could have implications for which party wins the seat in November. The incumbent here is Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the <a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-kaptur-becomes-longest-serving-woman-us-house-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longest-serving woman in House history</a>, who faces the toughest race of her career after <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> turned her seat from a partisan lean of D+16 to R+6. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s made the seat a top GOP pickup opportunity, and their strongest candidate would likely be state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, who is aligned with moderate groups such as the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/improving-government/elections/u-s-chamber-endorses-theresa-gavarone-for-ohios-9th-congressional-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> and the <a href="https://www.mainstreetrepublicanpac.com/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Main Street Partnership</a>. But Gavarone is only in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/OH/09/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third place</a> in the money race (there are no public polls). The top Republican fundraiser is hardline conservative state Rep. Craig Riedel, whose TV ads refer to Gavarone as a “<a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/88e5b4b9-e969-4b63-8a2e-650452d43cae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak, spineless RINO</a>” (Republican in name only) and are replete with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBFf4ySOhNY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative red meat</a> like “protecting the 2nd Amendment” and “ensuring election integrity.” Meanwhile, the second-most prolific fundraiser, Air Force veteran J.R. Majewski, <a href="https://www.13abc.com/2021/04/01/toledo-native-who-went-viral-for-trump-inspired-lawn-challenging-rep-kaptur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a> (though he says he didn’t enter the Capitol) and has admitted to hobnobbing with QAnon believers. Although this is a Republican-leaning seat, it’s not overwhelmingly so, meaning a victory by either Majewski or Riedel could give Kaptur a fighting chance to survive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While most of the action on Tuesday is on the Republican side, the Democratic congressional primary in Ohio’s <strong>11th District</strong> is worth watching. Back in August 2021, now-Rep. Shontel Brown defeated former state Sen. Nina Turner 50 percent to 45 percent in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ohios-two-special-primary-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special primary election</a> for this deep-blue seat (which was vacant at the time), but Turner has returned for a rematch in the regularly scheduled primary. The race is about as clear of a fight between the party’s progressive and establishment wings as you can get: Turner is backed by <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1513978565804572679?s=20&amp;t=TIsiN-VU8ZHflWKJ1O-abg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> and progressive group <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a> (which she used to lead), while the more pragmatic Brown boasts an endorsement from <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/04/president-joe-biden-endorses-us-rep-shontel-browns-re-election-bid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden himself</a> — a rare move for a president who doesn’t wade into intraparty fights as much as his predecessor. The rematch hasn’t gotten as much attention as the special election, and no public polls have been released, but considering Brown has already won one primary here, she should be in an even stronger position now as an incumbent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, don’t sleep on one important race further down the ballot: the Republican primary for <strong>secretary of state</strong>, which matters because the winner will probably be in charge of administering the state’s 2024 election. Incumbent Frank LaRose has <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/29/election-2021-hamilton-county-board-election-audit-results/8796488002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">straddled</a> the <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/09/how-referee-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-has-handled-this-years-big-fights-over-absentee-voting-in-ohio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line</a> between responsible steward of democracy and source of mistrust in it: He was the rare Republican secretary of state to <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/05/05/ohioans-should-able-request-ballots-online-elections-chief-says/5171320002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage mail voting</a> during the pandemic and <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/11/ohio-secretary-of-state-frank-larose-weve-gone-down-the-path-of-constantly-challenging-the-elections-when-we-dont-like-the-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledge Biden’s victory</a> after the election, but he has also <a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2021/02/15/frank-larose-drop-box-order-may-4-primary/6751892002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported other voting restrictions</a> and <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/02/09/once-claiming-moderation-ohio-secretary-of-state-says-trump-has-a-point-about-voter-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, “President Trump is right to say voter fraud is a serious problem.” On the other hand, his main opponent, former state House Majority Whip John Adams, <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/your-local-election-hq/he-thinks-trump-won-in-2020-now-he-wants-to-oversee-ohios-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes</a> that the election “was clearly not legitimate” and wants to eliminate early voting and no-excuse absentee voting. With a <a href="https://www6.ohiosos.gov/ords/f?p=CFDISCLOSURE:44:::NO::P44_RP_ID,P44_LISTTYPE:397843510,simple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 million</a> to <a href="https://www6.ohiosos.gov/ords/f?p=CFDISCLOSURE:44:::NO::P44_RP_ID,P44_LISTTYPE:396357310,simple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25,000</a> advantage in cash on hand, LaRose is very likely to win the primary, but the share of the vote Adams receives will tell us a lot about how many Republican voters are willing to subvert future elections in service of Trump’s lies.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As a presidential candidate in 2020, Joe Biden said he saw himself as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/joe-biden-michigan-rally-kamala-harris-cory-booker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“bridge” to a new generation of leaders</a>, yet he has reportedly said he <a href="https://thehill.com/news/administration/3272281-biden-has-told-obama-hes-running-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intends to run for reelection</a> in 2024. If he does, he may face opponents in the Democratic primary and, if reelected, would be 82 at the start of his second term. Biden’s approval rating is currently <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 percentage points underwater</a>, and though still relatively high among Democrats, it has dropped about <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329384/presidential-approval-ratings-joe-biden.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15-20 points</a> since he took office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that in mind, the crew follows up on last week’s 2024 Republican primary draft with its first Democratic primary draft to see what the bench of Democratic leadership looks like beyond the president. Also in this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, they discuss the latest developments in the current round of redistricting.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, voters in Indiana and Ohio will go to the polls to vote in primary elections for everything from Congress to county executive. But there’s one race in particular that everyone is watching: Ohio’s Republican primary for U.S. Senate. (Don’t worry, though, we’ll be back tomorrow with a preview of the other key races to watch!)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This contest has gotten a lot of attention for a couple of reasons. First, it’s an open seat — Sen. Rob Portman is <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/01/25/rob-portman-statement-reelection-2022/6699962002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retiring</a> — and the election to replace him is wide open. Of the seven Republicans running, four or five have a legitimate shot at the GOP nomination, and the winner of the GOP nomination will be a heavy favorite to become Ohio’s next senator. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, the primary is a chance for voters to nominate a very different kind of Republican from Portman, who served in the administrations of Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and was more willing than most members of his party to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/gop-senator-rob-portman-delivers-scorching-rebuke-trump-after-voting-against-conviction-1569235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticize former President Donald Trump</a>. But now loyalty to Trump has become a key litmus test in the race to replace Portman. For example, all but one of the GOP primary candidates have embraced Trump’s “Big Lie” that the <a href="https://news.wosu.org/politics-government/2022-03-29/immigration-false-election-claims-get-the-spotlight-in-gop-u-s-senate-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was illegitimate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">True, Ohio’s junior senator is likely about to get Trumpier, but the candidates still fit different molds within the GOP. And even though Trump has now issued one of his coveted endorsements in the race, other factions of the party haven’t given up the fight either — which means the primary will be a direct test of how much clout Trump has when other Republican elites dare to defy him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race started out with a clear front-runner: former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, who at just 44 has already had a long career in Ohio politics, serving in the state legislature and running for U.S. Senate twice before. (He lost to Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in 2012 and <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2018/01/josh_mandel_drops_out_of_the_s.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped out of the 2018 race</a>, citing a health issue with his then-wife.) Once a suburban moderate, Mandel has spent this Senate campaign embracing <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/twitter-removes-post-from-us-senate-candidate-josh-mandel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing culture wars</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMandelOhio/status/1399886781189853186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over-the-top rhetoric</a>, becoming a favorite of ideological purists in the conservative movement like Texas <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-josh-mandel-ted-cruz-ohio-donald-trump-0ebee797c9fa6e6fa12c575911f3bd9f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Ted Cruz</a> and the anti-tax <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/elections/pac-endorsed-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club for Growth</a>, both of which have endorsed him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Mandel struggled to lock down the nomination. For much of 2021, the <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21039477/8-21-oh-senate-gop-primary-ballot-memo-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other candidates</a> released <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-primary-polls-so-far-are-internal-polls-thats-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dueling internal polls</a> arguing that they were the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/544113345/MEMO-Interested-Parties-MIG-Nov-30-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most viable alternative</a> to Mandel, whom many Ohioans view as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/18/josh-mandel-ohio-senate-profile-00009969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ladder-climbing opportunist</a> for the way he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/us/josh-mandel-ohio-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glommed on to the Trump wing of the party</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former Ohio GOP Chair Jane Timken was the first candidate to pose a threat after Trump reportedly <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-endorsement-ohio-senate-2022-d7ef0b0d-c993-485f-af08-1990ed6fdd11.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came close to backing her</a> early last year; however, after Mandel’s allies <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/24/jane-timken-trump-senate-490504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted some of her more establishment tendencies</a> (she defended a Republican representative who voted to impeach Trump in 2021), the endorsement never came through, and she faded back into the pack. (One notable Republican — Portman — did eventually <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/02/16/ohio-senate-race-rob-portman-endorses-jane-timken-gop-primary/6811647001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorse Timken</a>, but this doesn’t seem to have buoyed her campaign. She’s in fifth place in most <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/don-jr-shares-poll-commissioned-by-pro-j-d-vance-pac-showing-vance-with-a-big-lead-in-ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent surveys</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That left an opening for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-more-inexperienced-candidates-are-running-and-winning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political outsider</a> Mike Gibbons, who has the backing of Kentucky <a href="https://www.gibbonsforohio.com/rand-paul-endorses-gibbons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Rand Paul</a>. An investment banker, Gibbons has spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S8OH00086/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $17 million</a> of his own money on his campaign, and it appeared to pay off in early 2022, when multiple <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/ohio-2022-voters-concerned-about-inflation-as-gop-voters-await-trump-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent polls</a> gave him a <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/03/OH-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-March-2-6_release-March-8-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share of first place</a>. In March, though, he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/18/ohio-gop-senate-debate-gibbons-mandel-fight-00018678" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost came to blows</a> with Mandel at a debate and, relatedly or not, <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TRF-OH-22-Sen-GOP-Primary-0414-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped rising in the polls</a> shortly thereafter.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More recently, state Sen. Matt Dolan has experienced a small polling surge, even pulling into a <a href="https://blueprintpolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BPP-OH-Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual tie for the lead</a> in one (albeit with only 18 percent). The wealthy Dolan, part-owner of the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, has donated or loaned his campaign <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OH00477/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $10 million</a>, but he has a significant liability that could cap his support: He is the only candidate who has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/14/donald-trump-matt-dolan-ohio-00008525" target="_blank" rel="noopener">willing to break with Trump</a>, saying the 2020 election wasn’t stolen and condemning the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Dolan has made a point of saying that he’s <a href="https://cbnc.com/as-ohio-senate-hopefuls-vie-for-trumps-support-one-contender-says-hes-the-only-one-focused-on-the-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not actually anti-Trump</a>, but for his part, Trump is certainly anti-Dolan: The former president has <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/20/trump-knocks-matt-dolans-senate-bid-over-cleveland-indians-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked Dolan</a> for the Guardians’ decision to shed its racist former name, the Indians (a decision Dolan says he actually opposed).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, the candidate who appears to have the strongest momentum of late is J.D. Vance, author of the best-selling book “Hillbilly Elegy.” Vance <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/07/01/hillbilly-elegy-author-j-d-vance-announce-u-s-senate-bid/5372716001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race</a> with much fanfare — including a <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/03/15/super-pac-supporting-possible-ohio-senate-candidate-j-d-vance-gets-10-m-donation-peter-thiel/4700540001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10 million donation</a> from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel to a pro-Vance PAC — but for much of his campaign, he was hammered by TV ads <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/23/jd-vance-ohio-senate-trump-comments-516865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighting his opposition to Trump in the 2016 election</a> and languished around 10 percent in the polls. But like Mandel, he has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/20/jd-vance-twitter-489722" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plunged head-on</a> into <a href="https://www.wyso.org/local-and-statewide-news/2022-04-15/j-d-vance-asks-voters-are-you-a-racist-do-you-hate-mexicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative grievance politics</a> to ingratiate himself with Trump and his supporters, and unlike Mandel, it has worked: On April 15, Trump <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/04/donald-trump-endorses-jd-vance-in-ohios-crowded-republican-us-senate-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bestowed his coveted endorsement on Vance</a>, and he has since shot up in the polls. The <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/OH-topline_Sen-Gov-Primaries_R_conducted-April-20-24_release-April-26-....pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent nonpartisan poll</a> of the race, conducted April 20-24 by Fox News, gave Vance 23 percent, Mandel 18 percent, Gibbons 13 percent, Dolan 11 percent and Timken 6 percent, with 25 percent still undecided.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As such, the final days of the campaign have devolved into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/us/politics/ohio-senate-race-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open warfare</a> between Trump and the pro-Mandel Club for Growth. The two have long been frenemies: The group opposed Trump in 2016, made nice with him during his presidency, but is now unafraid to defy him when necessary. For instance, shortly after Trump endorsed Vance, the Club for Growth kept airing a TV ad highlighting his past anti-Trump comments. When Trump reportedly had an aide text the group’s president to “<a href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1517222529311588352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go f*^% yourself</a>,” the Club for Growth responded by <a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_allison/status/1517227362907213825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing the ad buy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Republican primary for Ohio Senate will likely be seen as the first real test of Trump’s grip on Republican voters since leaving office. But while a Vance loss would certainly be bad news for Trump, it wouldn’t exactly be a repudiation of him, considering that much of the argument against Vance has focused on the fact that he himself used to be anti-Trump. Moreover, a Sen. Mandel, Gibbons or Timken would still (perhaps to varying degrees) stand shoulder to shoulder with Trump in the Senate. Unless Dolan sneaks up the middle, Republicans’ Senate candidate will still be a much stronger defender of Trump than Portman was.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the Republican nominee will still have to beat the winner of the Democratic primary before reaching the Senate. And Democrats have their own intraparty squabble for this seat. Moderate Rep. Tim Ryan is backed by establishment figures like <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/13/ohio-senate-race-sen-sherrod-brown-endorses-tim-ryan/8423798002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/01/tim-ryan-holding-virtual-fundraiser-with-hillary-clinton.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> and has <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bliss/docs/research/2022%20University%20of%20Akron%20Poll-v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide leads</a> in the <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/ohio-2022-voters-concerned-about-inflation-as-gop-voters-await-trump-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few Democratic primary polls</a> that have been released. But Ryan has also angered the left wing of the party with <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/04/04/facing-criticism-tim-ryan-defends-anti-china-ad-in-ohio-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent campaign ads</a> in which he vilifies China for the plight of American workers, and at least <a href="https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one progressive group</a> has endorsed former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau senior adviser Morgan Harper (though <a href="https://justicedemocrats.com/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a> have notably kept their <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powder dry</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ryan’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-tim-ryan-could-win-the-2020-democratic-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand as a blue-collar populist</a> is often touted as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/30/tim-ryan-ohio-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ best hope</a> to score only their second statewide victory in Ohio since 2012. But Ryan did just 1.5 percentage points better than President Biden in his district in the 2020 election, and Biden lost Ohio by 8 points. Given that Ohio has become a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning state</a> and 2022 is shaping up to be a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning year</a>, the winner of the Republican primary on Tuesday is very likely going to be the state’s next U.S. senator.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur, chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and currently the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#253797643d78" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world’s richest man</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/25/business/elon-musk-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck a deal to buy</a> Twitter for about $44 billion. Twitter users have been tweeting all week about what it means — in large part because it’s not clear how Musk, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/26/business/twitter-elon-musk-news#:~:text=Mr.%20Musk%2C%20who%20also%20leads,told%20its%20employees%20on%20Monday." target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to take the company private</a>, will change the platform.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his statements about his intent to buy Twitter, Musk <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">espoused the importance of free speech to democracy</a>, calling the social media platform “the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.” He also stressed that he is <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1519036983137509376?s=20&amp;t=z785z2SSqOctamYT9Bgf8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">against censorship</a>. Many have interpreted this as Musk wanting to significantly alter how Twitter regulates hate speech and misinformation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the digital town square Musk is envisioning might not materialize because Twitter has never lived up to its goal of being a marketplace of ideas. More than that, Americans seem to dislike the social media platforms that forgo content moderation entirely, with anything-goes platforms never being quite as popular as the larger platforms that limit some of what users see. A town square that is a free-speech free-for-all risks becoming the kind of place that few people want to visit, which serves as its own limit on the kind of speech it fosters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Twitter as it exists now fills a particular spot in the social media ecosystem. Almost all the information we have shows that Twitter, even more than some other platforms, is used by a relatively small percentage of Americans. Important people like politicians, business leaders, journalists and celebrities do make statements or announcements on Twitter that have real-world consequences, and it has been <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/07/11/activism-in-the-social-media-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful for activism</a>, serving as a starting point for the evolution of new political conversations and movements. Black Twitter users, in particular, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/11/social-media-continue-to-be-important-political-outlets-for-black-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report finding Twitter useful in this way</a>. Overall, though, Twitter might be more accurately described as a scrolling newspaper than a public square. Other social media sites, like Facebook, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/01/facts-about-americans-and-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stretch farther into the information ecosystem</a> and are likelier to reveal what most Americans are currently reading, sharing and saying.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Pew Research Center conducts regular surveys on social media use in the United States, and the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular networks</a> across demographics and political affiliation remain, by far, YouTube and Facebook. As of early 2021, 81 percent and 69 percent of American adults, respectively, reported using these two sites, and the majority of each site’s users visited frequently. This is particularly true of Facebook: 71 percent of users said they visited the site daily, and nearly half of all users visited multiple times a day.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By comparison, just under a quarter of American adults reported being on Twitter. And according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew study released in April 2019</a>, only a tiny portion (10 percent) of its adult users in America made up 80 percent of all tweets from that same group. And according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/11/15/the-behaviors-and-attitudes-of-u-s-adults-on-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another Pew survey from 2021</a>, only a very small share of tweets from American adults (14 percent) were original content. In other words, these users are mostly retweeting, quote-tweeting or replying. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So if Twitter seems like a place where random funny thoughts or outrageous statements go viral and quickly become <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the topic of the day</a>, there may be evidence for that. It’s in this way that Twitter <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/NGUHTG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turns conversations into kind of a game</a>, with likes and other metrics that amplify the feeling of winning or losing, and so the people on Twitter are those who like to play that game.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average Twitter user</a> is younger, more highly educated and wealthier than the average American adult, and is also likelier to identify as a Democrat. That’s especially true of very active Twitter users, who also post heavily about politics. These users are slightly likelier to say that immigrants strengthen American society and to see evidence of societal bias against women.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conservatives have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/14/conservatives-elon-musk-twitter-00025447" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said they feel censored on Twitter</a>, especially after former President <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/04/25/twitter-musk-trump-reverse-permanent-ban/7445633001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump was banned</a> following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But conservatives may be less likely to find friendly reception on Twitter because it’s just not their audience — and not because they’re targeted, as they claim.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And relaxing rules, which many think Musk will do, might not bring many conservatives back to the fold. In fact, most of the platforms that have tried to lure conservatives with relatively little content moderation <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/23/telegram-platform-right-wing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never really took off</a>, except arguably Telegram, which could have more to do with its encrypted-messaging option and private chat groups.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While it’s too early for much polling on how Americans feel about Musk’s purchase of Twitter, a <a href="https://www.momentive.ai/en/blog/musk-buys-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momentive poll released on Monday</a> found that 41 percent of Americans thought favorably of Musk (31 percent didn’t know). Fifty-three percent thought Twitter was headed in the right direction as a company, and a plurality of adult Twitter users in the U.S. (43 percent) said Musk would have a positive effect on the platform’s direction. Overall, though, 66 percent of Americans said that social media does more to hurt than help free speech and democracy. That reasoning, however, broke starkly along partisan lines: Republicans were likelier to say speaking freely online was important, while Democrats were likelier to think it was more important that people felt safe and welcome online.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the days since Twitter accepted his offer, Musk has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/27/musk-twitter-attacks/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized some of its executives, accusing them of left-wing bias,</a> and Twitter employees <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/26/twitters-top-lawyer-reassures-staff-cries-during-meeting-about-musk-takeover-00027931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are reportedly emotional and uncertain</a> about their futures. Ben Collins at NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/twitter-says-mass-deactivations-musk-news-organic-rcna26182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also reported</a> that Twitter confirmed that notable fluctuations in some users’ follower counts indicate some users are leaving while others are joining. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps more than other social media platforms, the nature of the Twitter conversation will ultimately be shaped by who’s on it and how users feel about what they see. Musk has said his intended changes to Twitter <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/25/1094604406/twitter-elon-musk-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will “unlock” its potential</a>, but so far, Twitter’s influence has stemmed from its small but elite cadre of avid users who have the power to amplify the conversations they see there. It’s also the group most likely to quickly adapt to using a different app that meets their needs and fulfills their goals if Twitter changes in ways they dislike.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Thirteen percent of Americans ages 65 years and older <a href="https://www.covidstates.org/reports/unvaccinated-older-americans">remained completely unvaccinated</a> against COVID-19, according to data recently released by the COVID States Project. However, the majority of older Americans (71 percent) were fully vaccinated and boosted, although there are pretty big differences based on education and income level. Fifty-seven percent of those with some high school education were fully vaccinated and boosted, as were 60 percent of those making $25,000 or less per year — both much lower rates than among those with a graduate degree or an annual income of $100,000 or more (both 83 percent).</li><li>Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392069/americans-widely-favor-welcoming-ukrainian-refugees.aspx">strongly supported admitting up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees</a>, according to an April 1-19 poll from Gallup. Seventy-eight percent of Americans said they were in favor, while only 21 percent were opposed. This is the highest level of support out of the various refugee crises that Gallup has polled. (The polls go back to 1939.). Likewise, an April 23-24 poll from Morning Consult also found high levels of support, with <a href="https://morningconsult.com/tracking-the-russia-ukraine-crisis/#section-1">72 percent of registered voters saying they supported</a> resettling Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.</li><li>Shortly after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/us/politics/federal-mask-mandate-airplanes.html">a judge struck down</a> the national mask mandate on airplanes and other forms of public transit last week, some evidence has emerged that a slim majority of Americans are opposed to such mandates. According to an April 21-25 poll from Quinnipiac University, 51 percent of Americans <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3844">did not support mask mandates on airplanes</a>, while 46 percent did support them. However, 56 percent said they’d continue to wear masks on airplanes even if not required to do so.

<p data-paragraph="main">As the 2022 primaries begin in earnest and presidential hopefuls look ahead to 2024, the fight for the future of the political right is underway. The GOP may be locked out of power today, but American parties rarely stay in the wilderness for long before they find their way back to Congress or the White House. When that happens, what form will it take?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to American Enterprise Institute senior fellow <a href="https://www.aei.org/profile/matthew-continetti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Continetti</a>, to understand where the right is heading, you have to understand where it’s been. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, he speaks with Galen Druke about the century of conservative history he lays out in his new book, “<a href="https://www.the-right-book.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Right: The Hundred Year War for American Conservatism</a>.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At this point in the cycle, special elections are one of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main indicators</a> we have for understanding what the midterm election environment might look like. If a party consistently outperforms its typical margins in these irregularly scheduled elections — like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats did in 2017 and early 2018</a> — it is usually a sign that the political environment is <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/1/9/1698453/-Special-elections-are-correlated-with-House-election-results-and-that-s-good-news-for-Democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaning in its direction</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This cycle’s special elections aren’t pointing in as obvious a direction as those of the last midterm cycle. But that could be changing, as Republicans recently had a particularly strong special election performance in California.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On April 5, voters in California’s 22nd Congressional District went to the polls to choose a successor to former Rep. Devin Nunes, who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-devin-nunes-is-resigning-from-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned from Congress</a> on Jan. 1 to run former President Donald Trump’s new social-media site. It was just a primary, but under California’s rules for special elections, all candidates run on the same primary ballot regardless of party — and if no one gets a majority, the top two finishers advance to a general election. That’s what happened in this case: One Republican and one Democrat will now advance to the general election in June. But the first-round results were also notable because the four Republican candidates combined outperformed the two Democratic candidates combined by more than 32 percentage points (<a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/upcoming-elections/2022-cd22/primary-official-canvass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66 percent to 34 percent</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is significant because the 22nd District (as <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CA/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently constituted</a><a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every other state, California recently &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;redrew its congressional districts&lt;/a&gt; to account for the 2020 census; however, the special election is taking place under the old lines, because it’s to finish the term Nunes was elected to in 2020, using California’s old congressional map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a>) has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> of R+11, meaning that, in a neutral political environment, we’d expect Republicans to win it by only 11 percentage points. Republicans, in other words, outperformed their partisan baseline here by almost 22 points!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this doesn’t mean we’re in an R+22 national environment. For one thing, Republicans lead <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls of the generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they plan to vote for for Congress without naming specific candidates, by an average of only 3 points. For another, there are plenty of reasons why this special election may have been, well, special.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s the fact that it was an all-party primary, which means it wasn’t a straightforward Republican vs. Democrat race like most special elections. What’s more, the campaign had the unusual distinction of being an election for a seat that will soon cease to exist. California’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> carves up the current 22nd District and parcels it out to four neighboring districts — all of which already have incumbent congressmen running in them. In other words, the winner of the special election was very likely to be a lame duck immediately upon their election.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the candidates in the special election, including the two who advanced to the general election, simply &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/4/5/2090082/-Morning-Digest-Maryland-s-Republican-governor-and-Democratic-legislature-reach-redistricting-deal#12" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declined to seek a second term&lt;/a&gt;; the other three are waging long-shot bids against Rep. Jim Costa in the neighboring 21st District in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a> Finally, with the special election having little bearing on control of the next Congress or the area’s future representation, many residents didn’t bother to vote. Only 21 percent of registered voters in the district cast a ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Quirks like this are why it’s generally a bad idea to draw conclusions about the midterms <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-special-election-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from just one special election</a>. It’s better to look at a party’s average overperformance in <em>all</em> special elections for the cycle. And when you throw in the seven other congressional special elections that have taken place since President Biden was inaugurated, the picture is much more mixed. Republicans have overperformed the partisan lean of these districts by an average margin of just 2 points — not exactly the red tsunami suggested by the California 22nd race.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The margins in those special elections have been really inconsistent, too. Republicans have done really well in some races, like those for the California 22nd and Texas 6th. But Democrats have also punched above their weight in districts like the Louisiana 2nd and New Mexico 1st. So the picture is still more confusing than clear at this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s possible, though, that the California 22nd represents the beginning of a trend, and that special elections from this point on will reveal a more unambiguous Republican advantage. (This was, after all, the first special election to take place since Republicans opened up a significant lead in generic-ballot polling.) If so, we won’t have to wait long to find out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No fewer than five special elections are on the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=MHA4bG9uOWNmZG03NnU5dmdrcHBncTIzODhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calendar</a> for the summer: On June 7, Republican former state Assembly Minority Leader Connie Conway and Democratic water resource manager Lourin Hubbard will face off in the runoff for the California 22nd. Then, Alaska’s at-large House seat and Texas’s 34th District will hold all-party primaries on June 11 and 14, respectively. Next, Republican state Sen. Mike Flood and Democratic state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks will go head to head in Nebraska’s 1st District on June 28. Finally, Minnesota’s 1st District will also hold a special general election on Aug. 9.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Republicans (or, for that matter, Democrats) outperform partisan lean in all of these races, it will be a lot more obvious what special elections are telling us about November. But if these five races produce another batch of contradictory results, we may have to conclude that the strong GOP performance in the California 22nd was a fluke. Either way, we’re about to get a lot of data about the way the electorate is feeling ahead of the 2022 midterms, so stay tuned.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Don’t count your chickens before they hatch — and don’t count your congressional districts before all the redistricting lawsuits are finished.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, the New York Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2022/Apr22/60opn22-Decision.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> that the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional map</a> New York Democrats <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-state-legislative-map-approved-albany-20220203-o3zkwpbp4rc2dezqmlpicy2zra-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enacted back in February</a> was a partisan gerrymander that violated the state constitution and <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/Court-of-Appeals-throws-out-New-York-s-17127915.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tossed it to the curb</a>. The decision was a huge blow to Democrats, who until recently looked like they had gained enough seats nationally in redistricting to almost eliminate the Republican bias in the House of Representatives. But with the invalidation of New York’s map, as well as Florida’s recent passage of a congressional map that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily favors the GOP</a>,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we’d be remiss not to mention that that map is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; being &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/politics/florida-congressional-map-lawsuit-desantis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;challenged in court&lt;/a&gt; and could &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; get struck down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> the takeaways from the 2021-22 redistricting cycle are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-countless-confusing-sometimes-contradictory-takeaways-of-the-2021-22-redistricting-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer so straightforward</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because much of Democrats’ national redistricting advantage <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorks-proposed-congressional-map-is-heavily-biased-toward-democrats-will-it-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rested on their gerrymander in New York</a>. The now-invalidated map included 20 seats with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> of D+5 or bluer and only four seats with a partisan lean of R+5 or redder. It also included two swing seats, but even those had slight Democratic leans (D+3 and D+4). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, all else being equal, we’d have expected Democrats to win 22 of New York’s 26 House seats (85 percent) under the map. But that’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/new-yorks-gerrymander-might-change-which-party-picks-up-seats-in-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way out of proportion</a> with how New York usually votes; for instance, President Biden got just 61 percent of the vote there in 2020.</p>

(The map converted the 1st and 11th districts from light red to light blue, and it also moved the swing district currently held by Republican Rep. John Katko more firmly into Democratic territory. It also chose a Republican-held seat upstate as the district New York <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would have to lose</a> as a result of its relatively sluggish population growth in the 2020 census.)<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why Republicans would have lost four seats but Democrats would have gained only three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those heady gains and losses were the foundation for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big national gains Democrats had run up about a month ago</a>. As of March 30, redistricting had added 11 districts to the “Democratic-leaning” (D+5 or bluer) column nationally (compared with the maps that were in place in 2020) and subtracted six districts from the “Republican-leaning” column (R+5 or redder). Today, though, Democrats are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up only seven districts</a>, and Republicans are no longer down at all — they’ve actually <em>added</em> one Republican-leaning seat. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If that were to hold — and, given what we’ve learned, we should <em>not</em> assume it will — Democrats would still chip away at the House’s Republican bias (the tipping-point House district in 2020 was almost 5 percentage points redder than the nation as a whole), but not by as much as previously expected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, thanks to Democrats’ strong performance in the previous two House elections (2018 and 2020), many of those newly Democratic-leaning seats were (and are) already held by Democrats. So if all you’re interested in is the outcome of the 2022 election, it’s useful to also consider how many seats redistricting puts each party in a position to <em>flip</em>. Back in March, Democrats didn’t have as large of an advantage by this metric, but they were still doing better than Republicans: I estimated at the time that redistricting would net Democrats around two seats in the midterms, while it would lead to a net loss of around three or four seats for Republicans (this was without considering the Republican-leaning national political environment). Now, however, Republicans clearly have the advantage on this score. I estimate that redistricting currently positions Republicans for a net gain of around four or five House seats and Democrats for a net loss of about four, based on the maps as they stand now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So depending on whether you measure by partisan lean alone or factor in which party currently holds each seat, you get a different answer for which party has benefited from redistricting this cycle. But don’t tie yourself up in too many knots trying to pick a winner. If there is one thing that we’ve learned this cycle, it’s that nothing is final until the last map is passed and the last lawsuit is resolved. There are still congressional maps that could get struck down in court, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida’s</a>. And there are still states that have yet to finalize a map — like, oh yeah, New York!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In its decision, the New York Court of Appeals endorsed the idea that a neutral special master — essentially, an expert in drawing political maps — should draw New York’s next congressional map. That would presumably lead to a relatively fair map, but the details and exact partisan breakdown are, of course, still a mystery; Democrats could still gain seats from New York’s map when all is said and done (just not as many as from their gerrymander). As a reminder, we analyze and track newly proposed maps in real time on our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting tracker</a>, so keep an eye on its <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York page</a> for the latest developments.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It wasn’t long ago that the U.S. economy needed a shot in the arm. Millions of Americans had <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost their jobs</a> as the country shut itself down to slow the spread of a deadly virus. At the time, policymakers, advocates and economists agreed that Americans needed immediate relief — and so they quickly acted on it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lawmakers passed a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/20/859795619/how-to-get-trillions-to-millions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.2-trillion</a> stimulus <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/20/859795619/how-to-get-trillions-to-millions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">package</a> in March 2020, followed by two more installments of COVID-19 relief later in 2020 and then again in 2021. In total, it added up to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/03/10/coronavirus-stimulus-international-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most generous fiscal responses to the virus</a> globally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There would be a catch, though. As U.S. prices continue to rise by rates not seen in decades, it’s become clear that the stimulus came at a significant, unintended cost: inflation. It’s unclear whether inflation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/business/economy/inflation-report-march.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has reached its peak</a>, but the situation is now economically and politically toxic, and it has left many of the same policymakers, advocates and economists now asking whether the stimulus checks were a mistake.</p>



<h2><strong>The stimulus had big economic benefits — but it also fueled inflation</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, COVID-19 stimulus undoubtedly helped Americans in some very big, tangible ways. Namely, it reduced poverty — beyond merely keeping people afloat during the early days of the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-275.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Census Bureau’s supplemental poverty measure</a>, the stimulus payments moved 11.7 million people out of poverty in 2020 — a drop in the poverty rate from 11.8 to 9.1 percent. And the 2021 poverty rate was estimated to fall even further to 7.7 percent, per a July 2021 report from <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/2021-poverty-projections-assessing-impact-benefits-and-stimulus-measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Urban Institute</a>. We don’t know yet whether this came to fruition, but <a href="https://www.urban.org/author/laura-wheaton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Wheaton</a>, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and one of the analysts behind the 2021 numbers, told us that it was clear from their analysis that the stimulus checks were driving a dramatic decline in poverty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, the stimulus checks also cushioned workers during one of the worst economic crises in modern history, which likely helped the economy bounce back in record time. In April 2020, when Americans were receiving the first round of checks — up to $1,200 with the CARES Act — the unemployment rate was at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/unemployment-rate-rises-to-record-high-14-point-7-percent-in-april-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a disastrous 14.7 percent</a>. But two years later, it’s almost returned to its pre-pandemic levels, with many job openings. “I hope we don’t forget how awesome it was that we supported people so well, and that we recovered as quickly as we did,” said <a href="https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/tara-m-sinclair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara Sinclair</a>, a professor of economics at George Washington University. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is also evidence that the stimulus, especially the last round, likely stoked higher and higher prices <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/13/low-income-high-inflation-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the very people</a> it was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/higher-pay-eclipses-inflation-bite-for-some-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intended to help</a>. Though <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/how-the-supply-chain-caused-current-inflation-and-why-it-might-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global supply chain issues</a> (and, more recently, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-big-a-threat-to-the-us-economy-is-the-war-in-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">war in Ukraine</a>) have been significant drivers of inflation, the divergence <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1518643904463077376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between U.S. and European inflation</a> suggests there’s more to it than that. In fact, a <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/march/why-is-us-inflation-higher-than-in-other-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a> from researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that the stimulus may have raised U.S. inflation by about 3 percentage points by the end of 2021. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are struggling financially as a result — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/13/low-income-high-inflation-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly low-income people</a> who don’t have a cushion to absorb higher prices. Moreover, inflation is outpacing wage growth. Despite a 5.6 percent jump in wages year-over-year, 8.5 percent inflation in March 2022 meant that Americans <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/even-in-a-hot-economy-wages-arent-keeping-up-with-inflation-unemployment-job-growth-federal-reserve-11649779113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw a nearly 3 percent decrease</a> in inflation-adjusted wages. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This wasn’t a completely unforeseen problem, either. Back in early 2021, some <a href="https://twitter.com/ojblanchard1/status/1358122330329927680?s=20&amp;t=m5ptDYgHBpsUqaNiRkYu6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economists</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/04/larry-summers-biden-covid-stimulus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised the alarm</a> about the size of the final round of stimulus — the American Rescue Plan, which was headlined by $1,400 direct payments to individual Americans — for its potential to overheat the economy and create an inflationary environment. According to <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/thomas-philippon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Philippon</a>, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, the stimulus checks played a chief role in creating excessive demand, which in turn spurred inflation. “The demand boost was very large in the U.S., and the stimulus checks were a large part of it,” Philippon said. But at the same time, many policymakers — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/27/fed-us-economic-recovery-weakening-463190#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%27m%20much%20more%20worried,to%20the%20United%20States%20economy.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Jerome Powell</a>, chair of the Federal Reserve — thought that the risk of putting too little money into the economy seemed greater than the risk of putting in too much. </p>



<h2><strong>The stimulus became political</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the problem is that the last rounds of stimulus — the checks that went out in December 2020 and March 2021 — may actually have been too big. But the decision to send an extra $2,000 to most Americans wasn’t backed by evidence or economic calculations. It was shaped by politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the CARES Act <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/senate-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-package.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed on a near-unanimous, bipartisan basis</a> in March 2020, when former President Donald Trump was in office, a much different story played out in the transition from his administration to now-President Biden’s. Toward the end of 2020, Trump pushed for additional $2,000 payments, which House Democrats supported and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/28/house-votes-on-2000-stimulus-checks-after-trump-signs-relief-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later passed</a>, but that effort was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/29/951208033/mcconnell-blocks-senate-vote-on-2-000-direct-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked by Republicans</a> in the Senate who were alarmed by the price tag. Ultimately, direct payments of just $600 were greenlit — despite <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-poll-majority-stimulus-check-too-small-2020-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad-based support</a> for the bigger checks among <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/12/28/78-of-likely-voters-support-2000-relief-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters of both parties</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democrats, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance, decided to campaign for larger stimulus checks <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-debate-over-2000-stimulus-checks-help-democrats-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the run-up to the Georgia run-off elections</a>. It’s impossible to know whether support for the checks gave now- Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff their respective edges, but Democrats did end up winning both seats and passing the American Rescue Plan two months later, which included $1,400 checks to meet the desired $2,000 target.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/about-us/people/claudia-sahm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia Sahm</a>, director of macroeconomic research at the Jain Family Institute, said that the March 2021 check should have ideally been smaller. But because of the politics of the issue, there wasn’t room to push for a lower number. “People had been promised the $2,000 checks,” she said. Politically, that meant it was either going to be a $2,000 payment — or nothing at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, a lot of the COVID-19 economic response <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/pandemic-failed-economic-forecasting/629498/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaned left</a>, which may help explain why <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/12/inflation-cpi-larry-summers-economy-right-or-wrong.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so many policymakers</a> underestimated the threat of <a href="https://www.vox.com/22996474/inflation-federal-reserve-nairu-ngdp-powell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation</a>. They were instead more worried about not giving Americans enough money — a lesson of a previous era. Democrats who were in office during the Great Recession — including Biden, who helped <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/joe-biden-oversaw-recovery-during-last-recession/609646/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oversee the 2009 recovery</a> as vice president — approached the COVID-19 recovery <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/upshot/biden-stimulus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined not to repeat the mistakes</a> of spending too little money. It wasn’t clear at the time, but many economists now believe that Congress’s reluctance to pump money into the economy after the 2008 crash led to a long and grinding recovery.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why this time around, Democrats wanted to pour money into the economy. It seemed like a clear political winner, since support for another round of stimulus payments was extremely high: Polls from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-debate-over-2000-stimulus-checks-help-democrats-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/stimulus-check-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early 2021</a> consistently found that the vast majority of Americans, including many Republicans, supported the proposed stimulus checks. But though Democrats won control of the Senate and passed the overwhelmingly popular stimulus — albeit on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a party-line vote</a> — that popularist ethos hasn’t seemed to bear fruit since. In particular, voters don’t seem to be rewarding Democrats and Biden for the extra money granted by the stimulus. A majority of voters <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-biden-inflation-gas-prices-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame Biden for inflation</a> — including a sizable chunk of Democrats — and disapprove of his handling of the economy more broadly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead of helping Biden and his party, then, the stimulus could end up hurting them in the 2022 midterm elections. </p>



<h2><strong>We will likely learn the wrong lessons from the stimulus</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The lessons we draw from the response to the COVID-19 recession are important, because they’ll almost certainly shape how we respond to the next economic downturn. In the wake of the Great Recession, policymakers shot too low. Now, they appear to have shot too high. If this were the story of Goldilocks, we’d be poised to get things just right next time — but politics is not a fairy tale, and it’s very possible that we’ll overcorrect whenever another recession hits. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, we’re still figuring out what the lessons are as the pandemic still isn’t over. And it’s, of course, hard to disentangle what could have happened had the government’s response not been so aggressive. One clear lesson of the COVID-19 pandemic, though, is that America’s social safety net wasn’t prepared to deal with a crisis of this magnitude, which is a big part of the reason why the response had to be so massive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our social safety net wasn’t ready to catch everyone who needed it, so it was very difficult to figure out who really needed relief and when the tap should be turned off, according to Sinclair. Rickety state unemployment insurance systems <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-social-safety-net-wasnt-ready-for-the-coronavirus-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t be recalibrated</a> to replace people’s incomes, so <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-getting-more-money-from-unemployment-than-they-were-from-their-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many people ended up being paid much more</a> after they lost their jobs. It wasn’t easy to target direct payments to people in specific income brackets, so the payments went out to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/1400-dollar-stimulus-checks-went-to-some-people-who-do-not-need-them.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some families who didn’t need them</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But with a better social welfare infrastructure, we might not have been as vulnerable to inflation, according to <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/milano/faculty/darrick-hamilton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darrick Hamilton</a>, a professor of economics and urban policy at the New School. Had we been able to identify and reach the people who were most in need of support, a huge, blanket response wouldn’t have been necessary. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[T]he automatic stabilizer of that leaves us less vulnerable to economic shocks, like a pandemic recession,” Hamilton said. “We would have that type of policy infrastructure already in place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The problem is that politicians’ incentives run the other way — there’s no political benefit to preparing for a nebulous future crisis, so they often don’t. And as anxiety about inflation mounts, there’s little appetite to pump more money into the country’s social safety net. “It would be a sweeping change, and it would look like a huge expenditure,” Sinclair said. “And it’s hard to tell people, ‘Hey, look, if we do this, it’ll look like a lot of money now, but the next time there’s a crisis, we won’t end up just spending a trillion or two, willy-nilly.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Depending on what happens with inflation, economists may end up concluding that the tradeoffs of the COVID-19 stimulus were worth it, but that won’t necessarily be the political takeaway. All of this underscores the fundamental tension of any response to an economic crisis — it will be designed by politicians, whose goals are shaped by the prevailing political winds. And at this point, it seems very likely that the political pain inflicted by rising prices will shape the way we remember the current response, regardless of whether economists agree.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Black voters face a catch-22 — a long-running catch-22, sure, but no less of a problem because of that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 midterms are approaching and Black voters must choose between the Republican Party, which has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively worked against their interests for decades</a>, and the Democratic Party, which has long <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-biden-is-unlikely-to-talk-meaningfully-about-race-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to meaningfully address</a> race and racism, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-failure-to-pass-a-voting-rights-bill-fits-a-pattern-of-failing-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as well as issues important to Black voters</a> — such as police reform and federal voting rights legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The sad thing, at least for most Black voters, is it’s an easy choice. In the last 60 years or so, the Democratic Party, despite its many failures, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/why-are-blacks-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has done far more for Black voters</a> than the GOP. That’s why the vast majority of Black voters cast ballots for Democrats even if they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-black-voters-are-democrats-even-when-they-arent-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t necessarily liberal themselves</a>. And therein lies the problem: Because Democratic leaders know that most Republican candidates aren’t a truly viable option for Black voters, the Democratic Party doesn’t have much incentive to court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of its most loyal constituency</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As former FiveThirtyEight senior reporter Farai Chideya <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote back in 2016</a>, Black voters are <em>so</em> loyal that they’re considered “captured” — a theory put forth by <a href="https://lapa.princeton.edu/people/paul-frymer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Frymer</a>, a professor of politics at Princeton University, in a 1999 book titled “<a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9313.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uneasy Alliances: Race and Party Competition in America</a><em>.</em>” In other words, they’re ignored by one major party and taken for granted by the other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In recent elections, there’s normally some sort of conversation around what direction Latino or Asian Americans are going to swing,” said <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/politicalscience/faculty/chudy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Chudy</a>, a professor of political science at Wellesley College. That “reveals the predicament Black voters are in because there’s not even a curiosity surrounding what they’ll do. … And I think they’re unique in that way.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Making the situation even more intractable is the fact that overt appeals to Black voters, especially from presidents or presidential hopefuls, are viewed as disruptive to both Democrats’ and Republicans’ non-Black coalitions, Frymer told me. Given the prevalence of racism in America, there’s a widespread belief that promoting certain civil rights causes important to Black voters are not “winning” issues — or, put more bluntly, that a candidate or party will lose white voters by promoting those issues.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what can Black voters do?</p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">To try to answer that question, we first need to understand what’s led to this predicament.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There was a time <a href="https://www.grin.com/document/276294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the early 20th century</a> when Black Americans were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/when-did-black-americans-start-voting-so-heavily-democratic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just as likely</a> to identify as Republicans as Democrats. At its national convention in 1926, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Temporary-Farewell/Party-Realignment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even went so far</a> as to reportedly declare that, “Our political salvation and our social survival lie in our absolute independence of party allegiance in politics …”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Keeping-the-Faith/Party-Realignment--New-Deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started to shift mildly around the mid-1930s</a>, however. By then, Black voters were becoming increasingly Democratic — driven by the party’s progressive economic and civil rights politics, emerging in <a href="https://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name/themes/fdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Deal programs</a> and <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1998-08-09-1998221064-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actions like the</a> <a href="https://www.history.com/news/black-soldiers-world-war-ii-discrimination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desegregation of the military</a>. (This is not to say that the New Deal uniformly advanced civil rights — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some programs</a> actually <a href="https://livingnewdeal.org/was-the-new-deal-racist-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further entrenched</a> racial inequities.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some racial liberalism <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/08/25/491389942/when-african-american-voters-shifted-away-from-the-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still existed within the GOP at this point</a>, but it enjoyed its last hurrah in the 1960s when the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, both Democrats, addressed <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-rights-act/civil-rights-era.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escalating calls from Black Americans</a> to end systemic segregation and to help alleviate their political and economic disenfranchisement. These increasing demands were solidified by Johnson’s signing of the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/civil-rights-center/statutes/civil-rights-act-of-1964" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, alongside the landmark <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“With these actions, Johnson and national party leaders wrested the direction of the party away from the southern bloc of the Democratic Party, which had been staunchly committed to advancing a platform of white dominance and Black subjugation since the Civil War,” said <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=6085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Davin Phoenix</a>, a political science professor at the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It didn’t take long for a white backlash to occur, and that backlash was concentrated in the GOP. Opponents of the 1964 law included rising GOP stars like <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/politicaljunkie/2010/06/17/127915281/flashback-friday-this-day-in-1964-goldwater-says-no-to-civil-rights-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater</a> and future president <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/03/george-h-w-bush-race-civil-rights-war-drugs/2197675002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George H.W. Bush</a>. Following its passage, Republicans began aggressively <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190265960.001.0001/oso-9780190265960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pursuing a “Southern strategy”</a> focused on appeals to racially conservative white Americans who felt abandoned by or disillusioned with the Democratic Party’s increasingly multiracial coalition. Despite <a href="https://www.270towin.com/1964_Election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing the 1964 presidential election</a> to Johnson, Goldwater <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/barry-goldwater-lasting-legacy-112210/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a number of predominantly white Southern states</a>. And <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/26/what-we-get-wrong-about-southern-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four years later</a>, former President Richard Nixon <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4129605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued — and arguably perfected — this playbook</a> through overt appeals to Southern white voters who felt like the political advances of Black Americans came at their direct expense.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fast forward to today, and an overwhelming majority of Black Americans identify as Democrats — something that’s been true for decades.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Black voters are still reliably Democratic" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4F8Da/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="567" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And party identification <em>understates</em> Black Americans preference for Democrats, as many people who identify as independents <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently vote</a> Democratic. Roughly 90 percent of Black voters typically vote Democratic — a higher share <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/03/07/african-americans-are-the-democrats-most-loyal-constituency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than any other racial or ethnic group in the U.S</a>. In 2016, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">91 percent of Black voters</a> backed Hillary Clinton over former President Donald Trump; in 2020, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92 percent</a> backed President Biden. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As mentioned, though, those lopsided margins come at a price. Given that there’s often no confusion regarding how Black voters will cast their ballot, Democrats often get away with far <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ketanji-brown-jacksons-nomination-may-not-be-enough-to-turn-out-black-voters-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more symbolic representation</a> to appease their most loyal constituency rather than further prioritizing Black voters’ concerns and agendas. (There is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of research</a> showing Black political interests are underserved in policymaking.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Black voters may find themselves steadily more disillusioned with Democrats, but they face no viable electoral alternative, since Republicans are an even more unsatisfactory choice,” Phoenix said. “Thus, Black people are distinctly positioned to have to choose the lesser of two evils.”</p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Black voters aren’t the only constituency loyal to one of the two major political parties. An overwhelming majority of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white evangelical Protestant voters</a> (84 percent) supported Trump in 2020, for example, according to the Pew Research Center; roughly 64 percent of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBT voters</a> supported Biden that same year, according to exit polling data. Those margins aren’t quite as lopsided as the ones by which Black voters favor Democrats, but those extra percentage points aren’t the only thing that makes Black voters unique.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, what makes Black voters’ situation different is that anti-Blackness <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00027162221078340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has long been a fundamental force</a> in American politics — on both sides of the aisle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A lot of our party structure, in terms of where people situate themselves, is largely influenced by their racial attitudes and what racial groups they belong to,” said <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/lafleur-stephens-dougan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaFleur Stephens-Dougan</a>, a professor of politics at Princeton University. “It’s often easy to mobilize behind anti-Blackness or some sort of irrational fear of what Black people are going to do.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Black voters are “captured” not simply because most favor Democrats, but because overt appeals to them<em> </em>are seen as disruptive to the rest of both party’s coalitions. But other voting blocs don’t necessarily experience the same thing. So, for example, Republicans <a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2019/4/24/18513213/trump-evangelicals-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can court white evangelicals</a> because direct overtures to this group — for example, promoting anti-abortion policies, Christian values or <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/trump-evangelical-transgender.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation against transgender</a> students and athletes — won’t turn off a majority of Republican voters. Certain civil rights issues that would have the greatest impact on Black voters, in contrast, are seen as too taboo to promote because being pro-Black is often conflated with being anti-white. As a result, politicians on both sides of the aisle <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-helped-build-the-social-safety-net-why-are-many-now-against-expanding-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often ignore</a> Black voters’ concerns because they don’t want to take steps that would either turn off white voters or make it seem like they’re <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupting the existing racial hierarchies of power</a> where white people are at the top.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Both Democrats and Republicans go after suburban moms because they’re not destabilizing to either party. Same with both parties going after farmers or different business interests. Most groups are not considered destabilizing,” Frymer said. “But because of the pervasiveness and systemic nature of racism in America, parties often stress the importance of building and expanding their white coalition.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fear that supporting issues typically associated with Black voters — for example, decreasing spending on police, or supporting the Black Lives Matter movement or reparations — will alienate non-Black voters isn’t irrational. Many of these policies and positions aren’t widely popular with white voters, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-democrats-are-wary-of-big-ideas-to-address-racial-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even Democratic ones</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Racism is a critical reason for the Republican Party’s reluctance to court Black votes,” Frymer said. “And if the Democratic Party promotes Black voters’ interests visibly, they might lose those soccer moms or the NASCAR dads or Reagan Democrats. So, instead, the party distances itself from its Black base and from Black voters.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This dynamic aligns with research showing that making race-based appeals can lower support for a policy proposal. According to <a href="https://osf.io/tdkf3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent preprint</a> from Yale University political scientists Micah English and Joshua Kalla, highlighting the benefits racial minorities receive from ostensibly race-neutral progressive policies actually <em>decreased </em>support for these policies. In fact, respondents were slightly more likely to support policies framed around class rather than race, they found. “Democrats’ use of racial frames in describing their progressive policies may inadvertently make it harder for them to adopt public policies that will advance racial justice,” the duo concluded. These takeaways have been given more life recently, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prominent data scientists</a> have argued that Democrats should not engage with Republicans <a href="https://messagebox.substack.com/p/popular-ism-and-the-democratic-messaging?s=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on issues related to race</a> and immigration and instead focus on “kitchen-table” issues like the economy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Given the insistence on adhering to the easily debunked logic that advancing issues that disproportionately benefit Black voters comes at the expense of white Americans — who remain coded in political discourse as ‘everyday’ Americans — there is an implicit association between ‘popular’ and ‘white,’” Phoenix said. “This is important, because so-called bread and butter issues that ostensibly benefit the broadest swath of Americans still have racially distinct effects on different groups within the electorate.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whatever the truth of this school of thought — and there have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/09/opinion/democrat-shor-politics-bill-clinton.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many rebuttals</a> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164144/popular-things-wont-save-democratic-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to its arguments</a> — it often results in ignoring Black voters’ concerns <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/02/joe-bidens-civility-comment-told-biased-whites-that-he-wont-upset-racial-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of fear of rebuffing</a> white voters. We see examples of this in the current administration, too, as Biden has let issues important to Black voters slip through the cracks. Despite <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/04/biden-accomplishments-police-reform-promises-law-enforcement-changes/7263626002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign promises</a> to radically change policing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-has-and-hasnt-changed-since-george-floyd-was-murdered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the murder of George Floyd</a>, a police reform bill never passed Congress. And on culture war issues, like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-keep-losing-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a>, Democrats have <a href="https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/1514253128257966090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopted a similar tactic</a>: Ignore or underplay the stakes of such debates because doing otherwise might activate white parents’ fears of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more progressive school curriculum</a> that teaches children about race and racism and drive <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-in-blue-cities-are-increasingly-outliers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditionally Democratic blocs</a>, like suburban voters, <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article252807478.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to cast their ballots for Republican candidates</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not clear how much longer Democrats can continue doing this without suffering electorally. According to recent reports, plenty of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/black-activists-say-the-time-for-pretty-speeches-is-over-they-need-an-action-plan-from-biden-on-voting-rights/2022/01/11/1fdbf730-7330-11ec-8ec6-9d61f7afbe17_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black activists</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-16/black-democrats-see-bleak-2022-as-biden-disappoints-on-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Democratic political actors</a> are beginning to sour on Biden and have expressed a desire for more than appointments and platitudes to solidify future support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Republicans want to uphold the racial status quo and Democrats don’t want to be perceived as being too racially liberal,” Stephens-Dougan said. “But there’s a tightrope for Democrats to walk here because they still need Black people to go to the polls and vote for them.” </p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">That leads us back to our initial question: What can Black voters do?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, there’s no easy way out of “captured” status. In order to do so, a large amount of Black votes must be up for grabs, which doesn’t seem likely. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, Black voters <em>do </em>have another choice besides voting for Democrats or Republicans: sitting out future elections entirely (or voting for third-party candidates). But it’s not clear how viable of an option that is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given the increasingly illiberal nature</a> of the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If they don’t turn out then potentially you end up with a Trump-like figure in office,” Stephens-Dougan said. “And while that could send a message to the Democratic Party to not take your votes for granted, it arguably ends in a worse outcome than if they had<em> </em>turned out and helped elect a Democrat who was closer to their preferences. The cost of sending a message or a signal to the party might be too costly for a lot Black people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That leaves Black voters with two other options. First, they could put their electoral weight behind local, state and congressional officeholders, instead of focusing on change at the federal level (i.e., the presidency). According to various political scientists I spoke with for this piece, including <a href="https://www.candiswsmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Candis Watts Smith</a> of Duke University, there’s a lot to be said for this approach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Those down-ballot prosecutors, judges, sheriffs and school boards match quite well with issues of criminal justice, public resources and education,” she said. “Given that those are the issues that many Black voters care about and the issues that influence people on a day-to-day basis, it makes sense for Black voters to focus on the positions of the elected officials who can do the work that they want them to do.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve seen examples of this recently. Take, for example, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2018 and 2020 elections</a> when a slate of progressive candidates who made overt appeals to Black voters and other voters of color won their congressional races. Indeed, the large numbers of racially conservative white voters who vote at the national level aren’t always present in many states and congressional districts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alternatively, Black voters could try to overcome racist messaging and hope that public opinion on certain issues related to race and racism changes. That’s a tall ask, especially in the near term, according to the experts I spoke with, because it’s highly unlikely any political figure would be able to overcome the anti-Black tendencies of many white voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there <em>is</em> a problem with simply looking at the polling above and declaring pro-Black issues political losers: Public opinion is fluid. It can change quickly — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/opinion/blm-movement-protests-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even if only for a brief period of time</a>. And on a longer time horizon, lasting change does happen. Especially when talking about civil rights issues, which often involve a minority making demands of society at large, large-scale change is almost always unpopular to start with — if it wasn’t, the demand or protest wouldn’t be required in the first place. Case in point: Civil rights marches and Martin Luther King Jr. were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nfl-protests-may-be-unpopular-now-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyll-end-that-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viewed negatively by a majority of the public in the 1960s</a>. Both are viewed overwhelmingly positively now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Does that put the onus on Black activists, voters and their allies to convince politicians that the issues important to them are worthwhile, then? Frymer, at least, argued that might be the case. “This is unfair, yeah, but the reality is that parties are rarely going to mobilize and change on their own unless they perceive that the political calculus has changed in their favor,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Others, however, including Phoenix and Smith, felt differently. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The reason Black voters are in captured status is because there’s arguably only one party for them to choose from,” Smith said. “If Republicans decided they wanted to be a multiracial party, then the range of choices for Black voters would increase by 100 percent.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of the choice that the Democratic Party and Black voters make, though, they should also acknowledge that public opinion on race-related issues isn’t as malleable as, say, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/30/16943786/trump-changed-public-opinion-russia-immigration-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public views</a> on Russia, free trade and the media. That’s because, as Phoenix told me, “many white voters have by and large reinterpreted long-standing issues and partisan debates through a racial lens, increasing the influence of their senses of racial conservatism, aggrievement and plain old-fashioned prejudice on their political decision-making.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps the greatest thing working in Black voters’ favor is that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electorate is quickly diversifying</a> and these changing numbers might eventually force politicians to stop placing white voters at the center of the political universe. “By discarding the outmoded zero-sum framing of race-relevant policy issues and framing their commitment to advancing the interests of Black voters as broadly benefitting all, the Democratic Party can increase its electoral odds in the immediate, and especially the long-term future,” Phoenix said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the future, then, it’s possible that politicking will instead call on all groups to engage and compromise on issues important to other constituencies beyond themselves. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By September 2021, the scientists and staffers at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wvR0kA6hcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had gathered enough data</a> to know that the trees in its green-tree reservoirs — a type of hardwood wetland ecosystem — were dying. At Hurricane Lake, <a href="https://www.agfc.com/en/zone-map/709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wildlife management area of 17,000 acres</a>, the level of severe illness and death in the timber population was up to 42 percent, especially for certain species of oak, according to a 2014 forest-health assessment. The future of another green-tree reservoir, Bayou Meto, <a href="https://www.agfc.com/en/zone-map/702/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 33,000 acres</a>, would look the same if they didn’t act quickly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were a lot of reasons the trees were dying, but it was also partly the commission’s fault. Long ago, the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers and their tributaries would have flooded the bayous naturally, filling bottomland forests during the winter months when the trees were dormant and allowing new saplings to grow after the waters receded in the spring. Widespread European settlement and agriculture largely halted the natural flooding, but in the 1950s, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission <a href="https://www.agfc.com/en/hunting/migratory-birds/waterfowl/gtr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began buying bottomland forests for preservation</a>, which it then flooded with a system of levees and other tools.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This made the forests an ideal winter stop for ducks to eat and rest on their annual migration south. Arkansas is a magnet for duck hunters, and the state has issued more than 100,000 permits for duck hunters from Arkansas and out of state for every year since 2014. But it turned out the commission was flooding the reservoirs too early and at levels too high, which was damaging the trees. The ducks that arrive in Arkansas especially love eating the acorns from a certain species of oak — and those oaks are now dying.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Austin Booth, director of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, knew that convincing the state’s duck hunters and businesses that there was a serious problem would be tricky. Part of the solution the commission planned to propose to save the trees involved delaying the annual fall flooding, which could mean less habitat for the ducks, fewer ducks stopping in the area and more duck hunters crowded into smaller spaces fighting over targets.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And all the duck hunters would have their own ideas about who to blame for the problem and what the solution should be.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-804005388-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Ducks in a wildlife refuge in northeastern Arkansas. <p>GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Last September, Booth gave a brief speech that was streamed live on YouTube, outlining the problem. He announced a series of public meetings to begin in the following months. Booth told me that when he began to plan those meetings, he thought of all the government meetings and town halls he’d attended after years working in politics. “I wanted to ratchet down some of the intensity that happens when a government official stands up on a stage and talks down to people,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, he decided the meetings would be dinners where the Game and Fish staff would eat alongside the people they sought to convince. “I just believe there’s a human component to sitting down and having a meal with someone,” he said. At those dinners, he’d give a brief introduction, then invite people to ask questions of the staff as they ate and mingled. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of the dinners, Booth said he’d stand up again and ask, “Is there anyone that’s going to walk through that door tonight without their questions answered or comments taken for the record, or with their concerns ignored?” No one, he said, came forward. The four dinners were attended by between 50 and 100 people, according to Booth, but those attendees then spread the word, dampening criticism of the new management system.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s interesting about this dinner program is that it began during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also required effective science communication to convince the public to accept changes, major and minor, to their lives. Even before this pandemic, there’s been a long history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/us/mask-protests-1918.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resistance to public health measures</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22958419/covid-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new vaccines</a>, and many researchers suspected that could likely be the case with COVID-19 as well. The social scientists who study these issues might have counseled an approach like that employed by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, using local messengers who had relationships with the communities in question and who could communicate in less intimidating ways.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the U.S. did not do that with COVID-19. Instead, rapidly changing information came from only a few sources, usually at the national level and seemingly without much strategy. And as such, many places have seen widespread resistance to public health interventions, like wearing masks and getting the vaccine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The intensely local, personal way that Arkansas Game and Fish approached this challenge is difficult, time-consuming and perhaps not always the most practical. But it shows the kind of intensity it takes to communicate an urgent problem, and may provide lessons for how to approach the next big problems — whether that’s another pandemic, an ecological disaster or something bigger and more existential, like climate change.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Before the pandemic, Matthew Motta, a political science professor at Oklahoma State University, and his colleagues Timothy Callaghan, Steven Sylvester, Kristin Lunz Trujillo and Christine Crudo Blackburn <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953619303934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studied parents’ hesitancy</a> about giving their kids routine vaccinations, like those for measles, mumps and rubella. Reasons varied, and the most prominent was conspiratorial thinking.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured this by having respondents rate on a seven-point scale their agreement with a handful of statements like “much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> Some parents who delayed their children’s vaccines also held strong ideas about moral/bodily purity, which often correlated with higher levels of religiosity. Evangelical Christians, people who distrusted scientists and other experts and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/19/conspiracy-theories-are-common-right-but-few-republicans-adhere-all-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people prone to believing in conspiracies</a> were also among the groups finding a home in the Republican Party, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of these characteristics also tend to cluster in rural areas, where <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-vaccine-attitudes-rural-suburban-urban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 vaccination rates continue to lag</a>. “With the very important caveat that we’re talking about two different vaccines … I would say it’s roughly the same groups of people,” Motta said. “My colleagues and I … tried to shout this from the rooftops. … We saw this coming for sure.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1366" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg" alt="Anti-vaccination demonstrators" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218063-1024.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>In July 2021, as coronavirus cases rose in Arkansas, demonstrators gathered outside a community town hall at Arkansas State University-Mountain Home to protest vaccine mandates. <p>Liz Sanders / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In subsequent research conducted before the pandemic, Motta and his colleagues found <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912920907695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible paths to countering vaccine hesitancy</a>. “One way we can try to get skeptics on board with vaccinating is to just make an effort to understand why they’re skeptical, and portray the benefits of vaccinating in those terms,” Motta said. For example, Americans who felt that vaccines tainted their moral/bodily purity were given information about how viruses also attacked and invaded the body, which raised their opinions of vaccines. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The COVID-19 vaccines, however, were rolled out without much of that targeted messaging. Worsening the matter, then-President Donald Trump and his administration made <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/14/trump-advisers-pandemic-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of missteps</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted misinformation</a>, which only further hampered the country’s ability to form a coherent plan. On top of that, the virus was <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/beast-moving-very-fast-will-new-coronavirus-be-contained-or-go-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast moving</a> from the beginning of the pandemic, and the United States is a big country with multiple public health agencies, each with a different level of authority. The authority that state and local health departments have varies by state, which meant communication strategies were varied as well. Meanwhile, in much of rural America, hospitals <a href="https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had already gone through waves of closures</a>, in addition to decades of <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305728" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underinvestment</a> in rural public health.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some nonprofit groups <a href="https://www.ruralhealth.us/programs/covid-19-pandemic/covid-19-vaccine-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to correct these rural disparities</a>, but unfortunately, the underlying issues were too deep-rooted for them to fully counteract. Rural Americans were <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jrh.12556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far less likely to take precautions against COVID-19</a>, like wearing a mask, avoiding restaurants or working from home. Last September, during the delta wave, the death rate in rural areas <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-killing-rural-americans-twice-rate-people-urban-areas-n1280369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was double that of urban areas</a>. As of Jan. 10, 2022, only 48 percent of rural Americans were vaccinated, compared with 61 percent of their urban counterparts, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/covid-19/rural-america/covid-19-vaccinations-in-rural-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1366" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg" alt="Arkansas residents attend a community town hall to promote Covid-19 vaccinations" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1234218538-1024.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>Despite local events promoting the safeness and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, rural areas overall still lag in getting vaccinated. <p>Liz Sanders / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These patterns are partly explained by preexisting issues. People in rural areas hold old, well-known anxieties about scientists, particularly when the scientists come from the government. <a href="https://www.covidstates.org/people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristin Lunz Trujillo</a>, a postdoctoral researcher with the COVID States Project, said this anxiety stemmed from an attitude that pits rural, hands-on knowledge against the kind of knowledge obtained from institutions like universities or government bureaucracies — a kind of anti-establishment view that extends to scientists. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lunz Trujillo told me an example of this phenomenon is land-grant institutions using their rural extension services to bring the latest agricultural research to recalcitrant farmers who don’t want to be told how to farm. This was illustrated in the 1983 TV movie “The Day After,” in which a Missouri farmer played by John Cullum points out the impracticality of a government agent’s plan to scrape up all of the topsoil following a nuclear explosion — acres of soil that would have nowhere to go. “Where did you get this information, John, all this good advice? Out of some government pamphlet?” Cullum’s character yells at the agent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And now this attitude has become more entwined with partisanship and partisan politics. In a 2021 paper published in American Political Science Review, political scientists David C. Barker, Ryan Detamble and Morgan Marietta looked at <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/intellectualism-antiintellectualism-and-epistemic-hubris-in-red-and-blue-america/37C9F95A5DF4F81BAF69677DC6C9C972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans’ growing distrust of scientists and other experts</a>. Their research shows that partly due to the education divide — i.e., college graduates prefer the Democratic Party, and white people without a college degree prefer the Republican Party — the divide between those who are pro-intellectualism and those who are anti-intellectualism is more entrenched in party politics.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Trust in science has become increasingly partisan" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Jq9Ca/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="500" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Importantly, Barker and his colleagues defined anti-intellectualism not as a respondent's ability or personal level of education. Instead, it was about respondents having positive feelings about trusting one’s gut and having negative feelings toward experts, schools and “the book-smarts of intellectuals.” In their paper, the researchers wrote that those who distrust scientists and other official sources of authority “distinguish those who are ‘book smart’ from those who have common sense, the latter of which they view as a superior means of ascertaining truth.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They found that people with this attitude were more likely to align with the Republican Party. Which makes sense. Trump has <a href="http://vox.com/2015/9/16/9342825/donald-trump-vaccines-autism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted the vaccine-autism myth</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/world/asia/china-trump-climate-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falsely claimed that climate change is a hoax</a>. Trump’s anti-intellectualism surely <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X17719507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracted voters</a> who already shared these beliefs, but he also might have influenced other people to take up such beliefs. According to one study, he was the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary spreader of COVID-19 misinformation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These partisan trends existed before Trump’s presidency, of course, but Barker and his colleagues wrote that they spiked during his tenure. And instead of receding once Trump left the national stage, the partisan realignment seems to be firmer than ever.</p>

And this identity is held not only by people who live in rural areas, but also by people who strongly <em>identify</em> as rural, regardless of where they currently live.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s more how people think of themselves versus where they are,” Lunz Trujillo said. She cited the political scientist Katherine J. Cramer’s well-known work on <a href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/katherine-j-cramer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rural resentment</a>, which illustrated that many rural people disdained anything perceived to be urban — racial and ethnic minorities, liberals, the LGBTQ community, cultural elites — and tied it to their rejection of intellectuals and intellectualism as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The key insight to all this work is that those who distrust vaccines, science and expertise aren’t doing so necessarily because they have a knowledge gap or a misunderstanding. Distrusting experts is part of their identity. Motta and his colleagues’ work <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21565503.2021.1932528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests that being anti-vaccine has become an identity</a>, too. In some respects, distrusting experts has become a political choice, which means that any message from an official source — whether it’s a researcher, head of a government agency or a journalist — is more likely to inspire the opposite of its intended reaction from those who view that source as part of the political opposition.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These trends might be spreading to include some experts themselves. Motta <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X22003024?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a paper earlier this month</a> that shows about 10 percent of primary care physicians were uncertain about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, despite abundant evidence that they have been extremely safe and effective. The vaccine-hesitant doctors shared many of the same characteristics as other vaccine skeptics: They were more likely to be rural and conservative. For rural areas especially, this data suggests a vicious feedback loop. People who were suspicious of the vaccines had doctors who were suspicious, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/intellectualism-antiintellectualism-and-epistemic-hubris-in-red-and-blue-america/37C9F95A5DF4F81BAF69677DC6C9C972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barker and his colleagues wrote</a>, the danger of anti-intellectualism becoming more entwined with partisanship is that these attitudes then become more entrenched and harder to overcome. And that will become true on both sides, as each group believes they have the best sources of information — a phenomenon he called epistemic hubris. It’s damaging public debate.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The problems we’ve seen with COVID-19 are also spreading to new groups of people and to other issues. Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, researches the social science of climate change, and she’s found that people are more likely to seek out sources that confirm what they already believe. “We see that scientific information is very, very clearly cherry-picked,” she said. Increasingly, she sees people looking for information that already supports their worldview, and that’s happening on the right and left. For her, this includes policymakers who have a role to play in solving issues like climate change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The challenge is how to penetrate these bubbles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Luke Naylor is the waterfowl program coordinator at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. I recently went with him to visit Bayou Meto, which locals pronounce as “bio-mee-da.” There’s no real way to measure this, but the nearby city of Stuttgart calls itself the duck-hunting capital of the world. On the way to the bayou, down a mostly empty two-lane highway, we stopped at a gas station decorated in woodland camouflage. Naylor told me the owner of the gas station opens before dawn during duck-hunting season to serve that clientele.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this month, Luke and his colleague Jason Jackson took me through part of the bayou to show me the dead trees. Certain species of oak were under unique stress because they sat in water for too long during the year, and the bases of some trees were swollen. As we stood on a levee, Naylor and Jackson pointed out a tree they’d watched die over the previous summer as well as other trees showing signs of distress. Elsewhere, we saw trees downed in clusters. Even someone without an idea of what to look for would have been stunned.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tree experts had started to notice these issues in the 1980s and 1990s, Naylor told me. I asked him if hunters had raised their own concerns, and he said they noticed more now that the issues had been pointed out to them. “We put a name on some stuff back when we started talking about it openly,” Naylor said. “People look at it like, ‘Huh, that tree is bigger right there,’ or ‘They’re all leaning.’” Some isolated dead trees are blamed on ice storms or other rough weather, he said, but the sheer number of dead trees becomes more obvious once you know how to recognize the signs. “You’re running your boat through here or try to walk through it duck-hunting, you notice real quick.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1143" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP19151546335561-1024.jpg" alt="Water rushes through the levee along the Arkansas River in 2019" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP19151546335561-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP19151546335561-1024.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP19151546335561-1024.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>Climate change is expected to bring more severe flooding to Arkansas. <p>Yell County Sheriff's Department via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Heavy waters from the fall flooding and spring rains were still trying to flow out of the reservoir. The water had to flow through levees built decades ago by the federal government, when building the levees was treated as an engineering problem, not an ecological one. The channels also had various right angles, which slowed the water’s course, making it hard to clear the reservoir as needed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This was the next problem they wanted to tackle: redesigning the old levees. They said that some hunters unhappy about the changes to the intentional flooding in the fall thought that spring rains were the real problem. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We never said it wasn’t,” Naylor said. Spring rains definitely sit in the reservoirs for too long and for too late in the year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The issue was that the levees are old and expensive, and changing them to deal with the spring rains would be a multimillion-dollar and multiyear project. Naylor and Booth, the head of Game and Fish, both repeated the same message: that the fall flooding was something they were already doing incorrectly, and was a problem they could control and a solution they could easily enact. That’s why they chose that route first. Taking ownership of the problem was the key to the program’s success, they said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I asked Naylor and Booth each if any of the hunters they’d spoken to asked about an obvious potential culprit: climate change. Naylor said that no one had. And while it’s true that the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission had been intentionally flooding the green-tree reservoirs too early and too much, climate change is expected to bring <a href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-ar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more severe flooding</a> to Arkansas, and heavy spring downpours are likely to increase in the years ahead. The region is already seeing wetter springs and higher rivers because the northern plains — where the headwaters for the Mississippi River are — are wetter, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That potentially controversial aspect was mostly avoided in their conversations with the hunters, which may show the limits of this approach. Whatever methods any group or agency takes to deal with a local ecological problem will be only a small piece of the puzzle if climate change exacerbates the core of those problems. Partisanship <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already affects views</a> on climate change and how to solve it — or whether it needs solving at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What struck me most about my time with Naylor and Jackson is that they were both also hunters and, despite being experts in their field, already had a level of trust with the hunters they were trying to convince. They spoke with mid-Southern accents, drove trucks and wore camo. They’re well-educated experts, but it’s hard to imagine that local and out-of-state duck hunters would see them as eggheads that could be easily dismissed. When Booth described his staff’s expertise to me, he said they had “dirt under their fingernails,” which was similar to how Lunz Trujillo explained the kind of experiential knowledge valued by farmers and other rural folks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But not every issue manifests locally, with local experts able to gather people for friendly dinners. Regarding climate change, Fisher says in her work now she is finding that people are often spurred to action only when the environmental damage becomes an extreme personal risk to them and their family, and when it is seen as preventable. Part of the problem with mitigating COVID-19, she said, was that many people didn’t see the virus as a personal risk — they thought they themselves would be OK, even if so many other people were dying.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Public pushback on the changes that the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has made to green-tree reservoirs has so far been minimal, according to Booth, but the commission also has a captive audience. Duck hunters, other hunters and fishermen rely on information from the commission every year to apply for licenses and announce when public lands are open for hunting. These hunters visit government-run websites regularly to check water levels and other information to plan their hunting trips. Plus, the green-tree reservoirs are entirely owned and managed by the commission, which means how to manage the lands is its decision.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I asked James Brandenburg, an Arkansas volunteer with Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers, a conservation organization that tries to engage hunters and fishers, whether this kind of approach was scalable. Could we do something like what Arkansas Game and Fish did with larger-scale problems? He described how one of the biggest benefits he’d seen at the dinners was that hunters and other affected groups could ask questions and voice their concerns — and that they were heard, whether or not what they said made a difference in the decisions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don't know that it needs to be scalable, it just needs to be repeated,” he said. “We have to have the people who are willing to listen. You have to have the decision-makers who are invested enough in the process of gathering that information to make it a priority to have the conversations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Increasingly, though, the question is how to have those conversations in the first place. It’s hard to share information if people reject it because it comes from experts and is reported through the mainstream press. That will determine, as much as anything, how we respond to serious challenges moving forward.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">There are still <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/5-crucial-decisions-jan-6-panel-00024104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of questions</a> surrounding the final phase of the House committee established to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Namely, we don’t know exactly when it will be, though the committee reportedly wants to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/house-jan-committee-faces-time-crunch-ahead-public/story?id=83765172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start public hearings in May</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It might be in the committee’s best interest to stick to that timeline, as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/gop-jan-6-committee-00005943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fate of the committee is uncertain</a> if the GOP takes over control of the House next year. Moreover, many Americans want to move on from investigating the events of Jan. 6. A recent Navigator Research poll found, for instance, that <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">39 percent</a> of registered voters thought the House committee investigating the attack was too focused on the past, compared to 49 percent who said the committee was doing important work. And a January poll from the Pew Research Center found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans were pretty divided over whether too much attention</a> was being devoted to the insurrection: Thirty-five percent said “too much” attention had been paid to the attacks, while 33 percent said the “right amount” and 31 percent said “too little.” That said, in another January poll (this one from Quinnipiac), <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44 percent of Americans thought it was time to move on</a>, while 50 percent thought that the attack should never be forgotten.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The investigation has been going on for a while now, so it’s hard to know how engaged Americans have been. But the majority of Americans are paying attention to some recent developments. The Navigator poll found that <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 percent of respondents</a> had heard “a lot” or “some” about a federal judge ruling that former President Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-finds-trump-committed-felony-obstruction-effort-overturn/story?id=83721530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely than not broke the law</a> in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, in line with what <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/04/05131819/2204008_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> found (52 percent of registered voters said they had seen, read or heard “a lot” or “some” about the ruling). And per a recent poll from Quinnipiac, 59 percent of Americans said <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they had been following the committee’s actions</a> “very” or “somewhat” closely.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, some polls suggest that Americans have been holding Trump less responsible for the attack. The most recent polling we have on this question is from January, but at the time, Pew found that the share of respondents who said Trump bore no responsibility at all for the attack had <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown by 8 percentage points from 2021 to 2022</a>. Notably, the share of Democrats who said that Trump bore a lot of responsibility for Jan. 6 declined by 11 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, most Democrats still <em>strongly</em> disapprove of Trump’s actions. That Quinnipiac poll found, for instance, that <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87 percent of Democrats</a> thought that Trump had committed a crime. But Americans overall are divided on this question. Ninety percent of Republicans in that poll said that Trump didn’t commit a crime. Independents are split, with 46 percent thinking that Trump committed a crime and 47 percent thinking he did not. Overall, 46 percent of all respondents said they thought Trump had committed a crime, and 48 percent said they thought he did not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t mean, though, that Americans — including Republicans — approve of what happened on Jan. 6. In the Navigator poll, for instance, <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 26 percent of Republicans</a> said they supported the actions of those who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, while 65 percent opposed them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But just because most Republicans don’t approve of what happened on Jan. 6 doesn’t mean they support the House committee further investigating it. That Navigator poll found Republicans were equally split between supporting or opposing the committee’s work (45 percent each), while a January Quinnipiac poll of registered voters found that <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 percent of Republicans opposed the investigation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, regardless of whether they support what happened on Jan. 6 or continuing to investigate it, a majority of Republicans still believe what drew Trump’s supporters to the Capitol in the first place: Trump’s false claim that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. Support for Trump’s Big Lie has remained consistently high among Republicans — in the first Economist/YouGov conducted after the election, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9j7sr0my95/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82 percent</a> said President Biden did not legitimately win; <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9itq17lrr3/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">73 percent</a> said the same in the most recent poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, this paints a picture of a Republican Party that might not fully support what happened on Jan. 6 but is very much ready to move on and, broadly speaking, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/trump-voters-big-lie-stolen-election/629572/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still backs the former president</a>. And with such a large share of Americans having already made up their mind on this issue, it’s hard to imagine a situation in which revelations from the Jan. 6 committee change people’s minds significantly.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/confusion-anger-elation-demise-travel-mask-mandate-divides/story?id=84167392">A judge ruled on Monday</a> that federal mask mandates for airplanes and public transportation were unlawful. Many companies have already moved to lift their mask requirements, but <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/support-for-mask-requirements-in-public-persists-although-worries-about-infection-continue-to-decline/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=support-for-mask-requirements-in-public-persists-although-worries-about-infection-continue-to-decline">the majority of Americans</a> still appear to be in favor of a mask mandate when it comes to public transportation, according to an April 14-18 poll from AP-NORC. Fifty-six percent of adults said they somewhat or strongly favored requiring people to wear face masks when traveling on airplanes, trains and other forms of public transportation. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had elected to extend the federal mask mandate for transportation, just five days before it was struck down, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/20/cdc-mask-mandate-federal-transportation-survey/">59 percent of registered voters approved</a> of the decision according to an April 15-17 poll from Morning Consult/Politico.</li><li>When it comes to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/truck-driver-shortage-biden-administration/">the national long-haul trucker shortage</a>, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of lowering the required minimum age to apply for a commercial driver’s license from 18 to 16 in order to address the issue. According to an April 17-18 poll of registered voters from NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ, <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/polls/full-report-newsnations-survey-on-covid-19-restrictions-immigration/">71 percent of respondents</a> said they were strongly or somewhat opposed to this. Americans didn’t seem to be fond of the prospect of self-driving trucks, either — 65 percent said they would feel not at all or not too safe driving if self-driving trucks were on the road.</li><li>As FiveThirtyEight wrote earlier this week, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-do-gop-lawmakers-still-oppose-legalizing-weed/">support for legalizing marijuana</a> is high across all 50 states. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marijuana-recreational-legalize-opinion-poll-2022-04-20/">a March 29-31 poll from CBS News/YouGov</a>, support for legalization is virtually identical in states where recreational cannabis is legal (66 percent) and where it isn’t (65 percent).</li><li>4/20 isn’t the only thing that has people seeing green — Earth Day is 4/22. When it comes to personal concerns over climate change, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/global-advisor-earth-day-2022">Americans were in the middle of the pack</a> internationally. In a poll of over 23,000 respondents in over 31 countries, conducted Feb. 18-March 4 by Ipsos, 38 percent of Americans said they had worried a great deal or a fair amount over climate change in the last two to three weeks. This was higher than the share in China (28 percent) or Russia (29 percent), but lower than many other countries like France (45 percent) or India (63 percent). Respondents from Latin America were the most concerned about climate change by far, with a majority in every country polled expressing worry about climate change in the last few weeks, ranging from 53 percent in Brazil to 71 percent in Colombia.</li><li><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/20/rnc-presidential-debates-withdraw/">Republican voters are split</a> on the Republican National Committee’s recent decision to ban GOP presidential candidates from participating in official debates, according to an April 15-17 poll from Morning Consult/Politico. Thirty-seven percent supported this decision, while 34 percent opposed it and 29 percent were undecided. In total, 80 percent of Republicans said it was very or somewhat important for presidential candidates to participate in debates, versus 83 percent of all voters who said the same.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Sunday, French voters will head to the polls once again to choose their president for the next five years. After narrowing down the list of candidates in the first round on April 10, voters will choose between the incumbent, centrist Emmanuel Macron, and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. This runoff will serve as a rematch of the election five years ago, when a relatively unknown Macron won two-thirds of the vote. This time, however, the race appears to be much closer. According to POLITICO Europe’s “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poll of Polls</a>,” 55 percent support Macron and 45 percent support Le Pen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke speaks with POLITICO Europe’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/staff/cornelius-hirsch/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/staff/cornelius-hirsch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cornelius Hirsch</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/staff/clea-caulcutt/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/staff/clea-caulcutt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clea Caulcutt</a> about the dynamics at play in the election. As Macron has occupied the middle of the political spectrum in France, with a focus on cooperation among European nations, the opposition parties have moved toward a nationalist, populist agenda.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Coming soon to a 2024 Republican presidential primary ad near you: Gov. Ron DeSantis stood up to moderate Republicans who wanted to appease liberal Democrats, and he won.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Thursday, the Florida Legislature finally <a href="https://twitter.com/apantazi/status/1517186221038002178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caved to DeSantis’s wishes</a> and passed one of his proposed congressional maps — the last major piece in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national redistricting puzzle</a>. And befitting DeSantis’s national reputation (and ambitions), it is a dream map for partisan Republicans, single-handedly adding four new Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives. But while DeSantis’s uncompromising insistence on maximizing Republican power may give him a nice story to tell if he runs for president, it could also be the map’s undoing in court.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Florida’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0109/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soon-to-be congressional map</a> (it will go into effect once DeSantis signs it) creates 18 seats with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> of R+5 or redder and only eight seats with a partisan lean of D+5 or bluer. (The remaining two seats fall into the “highly competitive” category between R+5 and D+5.)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="1360" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-2.png" alt="Choropleth map of the partisan lean of districts in Governor Ron DeSantis’s proposed new congressional map in Florida, showing a dramatic partisan advantage for Republicans." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="1230" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-mobile-2.png" alt="Choropleth map of the partisan lean of districts in Governor Ron DeSantis’s proposed new congressional map in Florida, showing a dramatic partisan advantage for Republicans." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-mobile-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-mobile-2.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redistricting-2022-maps-FL-hero-mobile-2.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This map will significantly shake up Florida’s congressional delegation, as it virtually guarantees that Democrats will lose three of their House seats in Florida: The 7th District goes from a D+5 partisan lean to R+14, the 13th District now has a partisan lean of R+12, and Rep. Al Lawson’s North Florida district is completely refigured into a solidly Republican seat. In addition, the new congressional seat that Florida <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained from the 2020 census</a> — numbered the 18th — is dark red under this map, for a GOP gain of four seats in total.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is about <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/florida/#GOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as big of a Republican bias</a> that Florida’s congressional map could have — and darn close to the most egregiously partisan map in the country. The map has an <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficiency gap</a> of R+20, which means Republicans would be expected to win 20 percent more seats under this map than under a hypothetical, perfectly fair map. Because Florida has 28 congressional seats, that translates to a 5.7-seat Republican bias — right on Texas’s heels for the “honor” of having the biggest bias of any state.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But it didn’t have to be this way. Republicans in the Legislature initially passed maps that were significantly less biased. The state House <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/504273-with-veto-looming-house-passes-a-florida-congressional-map-two-actually/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/H000C8019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map</a> in March that would have created 15 seats that were R+5 or redder and had an R+13 efficiency gap (though according to the inventors of efficiency gap, that would still qualify as gerrymandered). And in January, the state Senate <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/488460-florida-senate-approves-redistricting-map-for-floridas-28-u-s-house-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/S035C8060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map</a> that was close enough to fair (an efficiency gap of only R+6) that even most Democratic senators voted for it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But DeSantis <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/501809-ron-desantis-map-veto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to veto them both</a>, insisting that only one of his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0079/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uber-aggressive</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/P000C0094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposals</a> would do. His beef, at least publicly, was that the Legislature’s proposals preserved (in some form or another) Lawson’s blue district, whose <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/FL/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old iteration</a> stretched from Tallahassee to Jacksonville in order to pick up enough Black voters to <a href="https://mcimaps.com/lets-talk-about-the-florida-5th-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give them a voice in Congress</a>. Ironically, <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/508755-gov-desantis-takes-aim-at-fair-districts-amendments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeSantis claimed</a> this violated the 14th Amendment by <a href="https://twitter.com/RRHElections/status/1484312692920025088?s=20&amp;t=fb8wfT48cPhAeXodhJ6Jtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritizing race</a> as the main consideration in drawing the district over other factors like compactness.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first, Republican legislators brushed off DeSantis’s objections. They argued that the “<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Congressional_District_Boundaries,_Amendment_6_(2010)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fair Districts</a>” amendment to the Florida Constitution — a redistricting reform that voters passed in 2010 — required the preservation of a predominantly Black seat in North Florida. And, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/17/florida-republicans-defy-desantis-00009651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already miffed</a> over DeSantis’s strong-arm tactics on redistricting and other issues, they <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2022/01/20/florida-gop-led-senate-sets-up-clash-with-desantis-over-congressional-maps-1406232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firmly pushed back</a> against his maps and <a href="https://jaxtrib.org/2022/02/22/florida-legislature-unite-against-gov-desantis-redistricting-expert-to-protect-black-jacksonville-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his legal arguments</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After DeSantis issued his veto threat, though, they began to <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/02/25/amid-desantis-push-florida-house-releases-redistricting-map-and-a-backup-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make concessions to the governor’s position</a>. For instance, the House’s map made Lawson’s district much more compact by centering it solely on Jacksonville — but it still had a big enough Black population to keep it Democratic-leaning. So DeSantis still claimed it was a racial gerrymander and <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/512310-gov-desantis-vetoes-congressional-map-special-session-on-redistricting-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoed it</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To many of the <a href="https://mcimaps.substack.com/p/issue-36-the-new-house-redistricting?s=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor’s critics</a>, this was evidence that DeSantis’s real goal was not an acceptable congressional map, but to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/11/desantis-florida-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burnish his image</a> as a partisan warrior ahead of his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/desantis-gops-rising-star-2024-hopefuls-drill-anti/story?id=83143776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible 2024 presidential run</a>. His refusal to concede districts to the opposing party will surely appeal to Republican primary voters who increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view Democratic power as unacceptable</a>. And to a GOP base that cheers former President Donald Trump’s crusades against “RINOs” (Republicans in name only), DeSantis can offer the compelling argument that he stood up to members of his own party who were insufficiently cutthroat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That argument is even stronger now. After months of staring DeSantis down, last week legislative leaders <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article260313745.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally blinked</a>, saying they would not propose any more maps and would vote on whatever proposal DeSantis submitted to them. It was a total political victory for the governor: Not only did he defeat the Legislature in their battle of wills, but he also didn’t have to concede a single Republican district.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, DeSantis’s political victory doesn’t necessarily mean his map will be used in the 2022 election. With Democrats virtually guaranteed to sue over the plan, a court will ultimately decide its fate. And there are <a href="https://mcimaps.substack.com/p/issue-44-a-good-friday-analysis-of?s=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a <em>lot</em> of reasons</a> to think the map is illegal under Florida law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most obviously, Republican legislators were correct when they argued that the Fair Districts amendment requires the preservation of a predominantly Black district in North Florida. Even DeSantis’s top lawyer has <a href="https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SLA-BIZHUB22032912102.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledged</a> that the Fair Districts amendment prohibits significantly decreasing the nonwhite population of a predominantly nonwhite district (in legal parlance, this is known as “retrogression”). But DeSantis’s map does just that. Under the current boundaries, the voting-age population of Lawson’s district is 44 percent Black and 40 percent white. Under the DeSantis map, it is 55 percent white and 30 percent Black.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lawson’s current district is numbered the 5th, we consider his new district to be the 4th under DeSantis’s map because a plurality (45 percent) of residents of the new 4th are currently Lawson’s constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Florida isn’t even the only place where DeSantis’s map short-changes Black voters. The map also splits Orlando’s Black community between the 10th and 11th districts. It’s <a href="https://jaxtrib.org/2022/01/14/florida-legislature-disagrees-on-racial-protections-in-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debatable</a> whether the current 10th District (represented by Democratic Rep. Val Demings) is protected under the Fair Districts amendment, but its new configuration under the DeSantis plan may not elect Black voters’ candidate of choice. According to local Democratic consultant Matthew Isbell, whites are now a <a href="https://twitter.com/MappingFL/status/1514362815762509824?s=20&amp;t=pJ9UAwN_r_6qRYPP6dPt9A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plurality of the electorate</a> in the Democratic primary there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then, of course, there’s the map’s extreme Republican bias, which is also at odds with the Fair Districts amendment. (“No apportionment plan or individual district shall be drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party,” the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A3S20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amendment reads</a>.) Perhaps the clearest example of the lines being drawn with partisan intent is in the Tampa Bay region, where there are currently two Democratic-held seats: the competitive 13th, on the western side of the bay, and the blue 14th, on the eastern side. DeSantis’s plan, however, would have the 14th District cross Tampa Bay to combine Democratic voters on the eastern and western sides into one district, thus moving the 13th from a highly competitive seat to a Republican-leaning one.</p>

How do they know? Because the Florida Supreme Court has said so in the past. In 2015, the court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=966573952906433631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> Florida’s then-congressional map in part specifically because the 14th District crossed Tampa Bay.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There seems to be little question that Florida’s new congressional map is illegal under state law. So shouldn’t it be a slam dunk that the courts will throw it out? Not necessarily. The courts may agree with DeSantis’s position that the requirements of the Florida Constitution — specifically, its protections of minority districts — are <em>themselves</em> unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. Indeed, DeSantis’s implicit goal is to get the Fair Districts amendment struck down entirely — and this map is his vehicle for doing so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s uncertain what the Florida Supreme Court will do here. On one hand, the court had no issues enforcing the Fair Districts amendment just seven years ago. On the other, four of the five justices who supported that ruling are now off the court — three of them replaced by DeSantis appointees. But then again, earlier this year, the court <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/10/redistricting-florida-supreme-court-gov-desantis-advisory-opinion-denied-al-lawson-congressional/6735854001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected DeSantis’s request</a> for a preemptive, advisory opinion into whether Lawson’s district was legal, an action that was interpreted as a setback for the governor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the map is struck down, it would obviously be a blow to Republicans — and, presumably, DeSantis by extension. His refusal to budge from his hardline position may, in the end, result in a much better map for Democrats than the one he vetoed from the Legislature. But from a narrative perspective, DeSantis will probably be fine: He can still tell 2024 primary voters that he fought the good fight and blame the end result on other, less uncompromising Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if the court upholds the map, it would be a much more tangible blow to Democrats and Black voters in Florida, who would find themselves with significantly less representation in Congress. And if the court strikes down the Fair Districts amendment in doing so, it would leave those people with no obvious legal recourse. In short, a lot is on the line in Tallahassee right now.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">We’re almost six months from the 2022 midterm election, and Republicans have big dreams for their potential gains. President Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is mired in the low 40s</a>, and the GOP already holds a lead in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic ballot polling</a> that history suggests <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could grow as the election nears</a>. In the race for the Senate, this means that the GOP has a very good shot at gaining <em>at least</em> the one seat it needs to capture the evenly-divided Senate. As such, there’s an especially strong focus on the Republican Senate primaries, as the eventual nominees could be part of a new GOP majority following the November election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We took a look at the Senate contests and broke down the high-profile races into three groups: First, the seven primaries in battleground states, where Republicans will try to either maintain control of competitive GOP-held seats or defeat Democratic incumbents. Second, the four red-state primaries for seats where Republican retirements have set the stage for contentious GOP nomination battles, if not necessarily competitive general elections. And lastly, the two races where incumbent Republican senators face a potentially serious primary challenger. In the table below are the 13 Republican Senate primaries that fall into these categories for the 2022 midterms — a list that could change going forward.</p>

<h2><strong>Republican primaries in battleground states</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of the seven battleground races in the Senate, the Pennsylvania Senate primary may be the most high profile for the GOP this cycle. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey’s retirement attracted a bevy of candidates to the race, but the GOP field has now developed into a close contest between former hedge fund manager David McCormick and physician and TV personality Mehmet Öz. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both men are <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/mehmet-oz-david-mccormick-money-pa-2022-senate-race-20220418.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independently wealthy</a> and have largely self-funded their campaigns — Öz <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00638/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has loaned his campaign</a> $11 million, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2PA00661/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McCormick nearly</a> $7 million. But they’ve also received ample help from allied outside groups, which have spent $18.6 million supporting or opposing the two frontrunners in the primary, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=PAS1&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to OpenSecrets</a>. McCormick and his allies <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/21/pro-oz-group-mccormick-ad-527571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried to cast</a> Öz as a Hollywood celebrity out of touch with conservative values, while Öz and his team <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/ads-attacking-dave-mccormick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have sought to portray</a> McCormick as a wealthy job outsourcer and “friend” of China. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/pennsylvania-2022-gop-poll-david-mccormick-leads-primary-for-u-s-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent polls</a> have shown <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KHupfGszGbdtV3H7ygDdS8-Mb-0BTUf/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McCormick and Öz</a> running <a href="https://twitter.com/Eagle63/status/1513949280431747080?s=20&amp;t=ajwQ4CZOPgNc6mY3b561cQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neck and neck</a> with about a month to go until the May 17 primary, but it remains to be seen how the latest big development in the race — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/09/trump-leans-toward-dr-oz-in-pennsylvania-senate-race-00024272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Trump’s endorsement of Öz</a> in early April — will affect the contest. The first post-endorsement survey from GOP pollster <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/pa-sen-gop-0415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group found</a> Öz leading McCormick 23 percent to 20 percent, but that was a less substantial lead than Oz’s 11-point advantage over McCormick in <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/pa-sen-gop-survey-0209/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar’s February survey</a>. Moreover, McCormick and Öz haven’t been polling so far ahead of other candidates as to rule out a surge by another contender like conservative activist Kathy Barnette, businessman Jeff Bartos or former Ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: Whoever advances from the GOP primary faces a highly competitive race in November, likely against either Lt. Gov. John Fetterman or Rep. Conor Lamb on the Democratic side, which is why Pennsylvania’s Senate race is one of the most important battleground races in 2022.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In North Carolina, Sen. Richard Burr’s retirement has forced the GOP to defend another open seat in a competitive state, and the Republican primary there has become a head-to-head tilt between Rep. Ted Budd and former Gov. Pat McCrory. Whoever wins could find themselves headed to the Senate, too. Although North Carolina often has close elections, it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leans just red enough</a> that either Republican would likely start out as a slight favorite against former state Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley, the presumptive Democratic nominee. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At this point, Budd looks to be the likely favorite as he has Trump’s backing and <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=87274913-881c-42d7-b655-52ef21ac8ab2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most polls</a> have <a href="https://www.johnlocke.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/19371-JLF-NC-Toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put him</a> ahead <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/north-carolina-2022-poll-ted-budd-holds-16-point-lead-in-republican-primary-for-u-s-senate-leads-potential-matchup-against-democrat-cheri-beasley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of McCrory</a>. He also has a clear financial edge thanks to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=NCS2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside support</a> from the Club for Growth, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00487470/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has spent</a> about $8.7 million backing Budd and attacking McCrory. (Both candidates have <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/NC/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> a little over $4 million.) The former governor <a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_allison/status/1513517072998875141" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t giving up</a>, though, as he’s attacked Budd as a D.C. insider and played up his own conservative credentials.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning now to the five competitive seats held by Democrats, Arizona’s GOP primary field is also quite busy, as <a href="https://apps.arizona.vote/electioninfo/elections/2022-primary-election/federal/2518/32/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five candidates are competing</a> to take on Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. <a href="https://twitter.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1511794690953252876?s=20&amp;t=3qWHdsZacZQB0vpP6ze-JA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent surveys</a> suggest state Attorney General Mark Brnovich and energy executive Jim Lamon <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/az-gop-gov-race-lake-leads-robson-climbing-salmon-stalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be</a> co-frontrunners, but venture capitalist Blake Masters is also in the mix. Brnovich actually <a href="https://blog.ohpredictive.com/press-releases/state-of-the-arizona-u.s.-senate-contest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once seemed</a> to have a clear lead in this race, but <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2022/01/15/trump-points-a-big-finger-at-brnovich-in-florence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s earned Trump’s antipathy</a> in recent months by failing to aggressively back Trump’s false claims about fraud in the 2020 election. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Trump <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/18/trump-signals-endorsement-coming-senate-race-but-not-brnovich/7362260001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks likely to endorse someone else here</a>, should he take the plunge. And thanks to their financial edge, Lamon or Masters could be well-positioned to capitalize on such backing. <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00331/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lamon has given his own campaign</a> $13 million, while Masters <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00372/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $3.8 million and garnered $3.5 million <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00777185/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in outside support</a> via a super PAC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/02/peter-thiel-tied-dark-money-group-helping-bankroll-super-pac-spending-on-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded by</a> billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel. Brnovich, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2AZ00356/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only raised</a> $2.5 million, paling in comparison. Money is likely to really matter in this race, too, since the primary winner will need to bring in enough resources to remotely match Kelly’s fundraising prowess (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0AZ00350/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s raised</a> $39 million so far).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic-held seats in Georgia and Nevada will also be extremely competitive in November and, as such, are seeing a fair amount of competition on the GOP side since Trump-endorsed Republicans haven’t entirely cleared the field. In Georgia, former NFL running back Herschel Walker <a href="https://www.cbs46.com/2022/04/14/gop-primary-poll-reveals-front-runners-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is polling</a> at around <a href="https://www.spryresearch.com/so/e9O0aQYU1#/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 percent</a> in <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/georgia-2022-poll-herschel-walker-leads-senator-warnock-49-to-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his primary</a>, making him the favorite to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. But he might still have some primary problems: Walker’s past <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-herschel-walker-confronts-his-mental-health-domestic-violence-allegations-33b96336-77c1-4b3c-915d-896746c52694.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health struggles</a>, allegations of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violence against women</a> and <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/herschel-walkers-business-record-reveals-creditor-lawsuits-exaggerated-claims/D3FRT4RA7NFKTN23423ENPUP7A/?link_id=8&amp;can_id=8094ef3ca9e2fe4af466070f61a27eb7&amp;source=email-morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing&amp;email_referrer=email_1499145&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-georgia-republicans-try-to-take-down-herschel-walker-despite-trumps-backing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revelations about his business record</a> have encouraged opposition Republican super PACs <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/01/herschel-walker-primary-00022192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to spend millions</a> ahead of the May 24 primary to push his support below 50 percent, which would force a June 21 runoff against either state Agricultural Commissioner Gary Black or former Navy SEAL officer Latham Saddler. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Nevada, meanwhile, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt has <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/donald-trump-endorses-ex-nevada-ag-adam-laxalt-for-senate-2424479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement</a> and is the frontrunner to take on Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who might be Democrats’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/nevada-midterms-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most endangered incumbent</a>. But it’s not clear yet that Laxalt will face off against Masto, as he’s attracted a serious challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/NV/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has managed</a> to raise $3.2 million to Laxalt’s $4.4 million. Granted, the only primary poll we’ve seen <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CfGPAC_NV-Statewide_PollMemo_220320.pdf" target="_blank">found Laxalt way ahead</a>, but it was a poll conducted for the Club for Growth, which has endorsed Laxalt, and as always, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank">we have to be cautious</a> when interpreting partisan polls.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last in this category are the primaries in Colorado and New Hampshire, where Republicans may also have a shot at defeating Democratic incumbents if the electoral environment is very favorable toward them this fall. There’s a lot of uncertainty in both races at this point, though. The Colorado GOP’s pre-primary convention, for instance, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/04/09/colorado-senate-race-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent two largely unknown candidates</a> to the primary, while the Republican primary field in New Hampshire <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/bruce-fenton-new-hampshire-gop-senate-race/39596372" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still developing</a>, partly because popular GOP Gov. Chris Sununu <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/11/09/gov-chris-sununu-not-running-for-new-hampshire-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a pass on the race</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Red-state Republican primaries where retirements have shaken up the field</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In four more states, GOP retirements have set the stage for crowded primary fields. These states won’t be as competitive in November as the previous category, but who wins in each of these states is important for the future of the GOP. And of these four contests, Ohio’s Senate primary is probably the most high-profile. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The contest to succeed retiring Sen. Rob Portman is both crowded and costing everyone a pretty penny. Three of the candidates have done a lot of self-funding — state Sen. Matt Dolan to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OH00477/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the tune of $10.5 million</a>; businessman Mike Gibbons, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S8OH00086/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16.6 million</a>; and former Ohio GOP Chairwoman Jane Timken, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OH00360/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 million</a> — and then two other candidates have benefited from millions <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=OHS2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in outside spending</a>, former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and venture capitalist and author J.D. Vance. (Pro-Mandel PACs and super PACs have spent about $9.5 million aiding him, while pro-Vance groups have boosted their candidate with $7.6 million).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polling-wise, the race has been a bit of a “<a href="https://suggestedreads.com/best-choose-your-own-adventure-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose Your Own Adventure</a>” story, too, because nearly every poll has been sponsored by a campaign — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-primary-polls-so-far-are-internal-polls-thats-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most of any Senate race in the country</a>. Most polls have put Mandel or Gibbons in the lead, but their advantage is hardly insurmountable; they typically earn less than 25 percent support. The race might also now take a turn: Last Friday, Vance <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/15/1093148912/trump-endorses-j-d-vance-wading-into-ohios-contentious-republican-senate-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Trump’s endorsement</a>. No polls have been released since then, but at the very least, the Trump endorsement has already <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/19/thiel-pumps-another-3-5m-into-vance-super-pac-after-trump-endorsement-00026375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned Vance’s super PAC</a> another $3.5 million in donations from Thiel, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has bankrolled</a> Vance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An even uglier GOP primary is playing out in Missouri, where Sen. Roy Blunt is retiring. This race <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-elections-st-louis-coronavirus-pandemic-missouri-tigers-mens-basketball-eric-greitens-34bcb44de0235873c32f4f2f22666253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has centered around</a> disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned in 2018 after being indicted by a grand jury over his alleged threat of blackmail against a woman with whom he’d had an extramarital affair, in addition to separate criminal charges against him for alleged campaign finance violations. But with high name recognition in the state and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/06/gop-megadonor-eric-greitens-498347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super PAC backed by</a> conservative megadonor Richard Uihlein, Greitens could win, which has given <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eric-greitens-seeks-comeback-missouri-us-senate-gop-4e77ad06d66767365bfcdfee62bb0ef0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national and state Republican leaders fits</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are other major contenders in this race: Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, Rep. Vicky Hartzler and Rep. Billy Long, with each of them <a href="https://www.ky3.com/2022/03/11/gop-split-alternative-greitens-missouri-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to position themselves</a> as the top anti-Greitens choice. But so far, no one has jumped ahead. <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1513570590581477378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most recent</a> surveys <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/11/greitens-hartzler-missouri-senate-race-00024351" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have found</a> Greitens <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/mo-sen-gop-0329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running neck and neck</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/kcmikemahoney/status/1507714530134175752?s=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schmitt and Hartzler</a> (and with Long in a distant fourth). GOP worries about Greitens have also only continued to grow with <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/greitens-accusations-gop-senate-bids/63-82dd88e1-185f-4577-a93a-cdf98f4322b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greitens’s ex-wife</a> alleging that he acted violently toward her and their children. A Trump endorsement might be enough to break the logjam, but Trump hasn’t weighed in yet, and we’re still a long way from the Aug. 2 primary, so there could be many more twists and turns in the Show Me State.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two other red states, Alabama and Oklahoma, also have open-seat Republican primaries of note, and both could head to runoffs. In Alabama, the May 24 primary to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Shelby features a three-way race involving former Shelby chief of staff Katie Britt, Rep. Mo Brooks and Army veteran Mike Durant. Brooks initially had the upper hand, thanks in part to Trump’s endorsement, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/17/politics/brooks-trump-alabama-senate-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his flailing campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mo-brooks-is-disappointing-trump-mulls-pulling-alabama-senate-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inconsistent backing</a> of false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/03/23/donald-trump-withdraws-endorsement-mo-brooks-alabama-senate/7139178001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompted Trump to un-endorse Brooks</a> in late March. The <a href="https://www.aldailynews.com/durant-leads-britt-in-new-senate-poll-brooks-far-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited polling</a> suggests Durant and Britt <a href="https://1819news.com/news/item/poll-reveals-tight-race-for-u-s-senate-03-23-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are now the likeliest pairing</a> to advance to a runoff. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Oklahoma, Sen. Jim Inhofe’s <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/02/25/inhofe-tells-newspaper-he-will-step-aside-at-years-end-and-support-aide-for-his-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resignation precipitated a special election</a> that has attracted a big field, making a runoff a real possibility.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhofe’s resignation will &lt;a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/oklahoma-sen-jim-inhofe-to-announce-resignation-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;take effect&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 3, 2023, meaning the winner of the special election will take office at the start of the next Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> Rep. Markwayne Mullin led <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60099f1f6ffad96a2d94bf98/t/6244cdc1a7aa820e29da4d52/1648676290494/Toplines_Oklahoma+GOP+Statewide+Poll_March+2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a late-March poll</a> from GOP pollster Amber Integrated with 39 percent, followed by former state House speaker T.W. Shannon at 14 percent, but former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2022/04/15/scott-pruitt-trump-cabinet-joins-race-replace-jim-inhofe-us-senate-oklahoma/7333886001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the race</a> right before the filing deadline, further muddying the waters.</p>



<h2><strong>The Republican incumbents with notable intraparty challengers</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there are two primaries involving Republican incumbents that are worth keeping an eye on. First up, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who must <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/12/kelly-tshibaka-backed-by-trump-officially-files-for-senate-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face down an intraparty challenge</a> from Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, the former commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Administration. It’s hard to know how much trouble Murkowski is in at this point, as the race <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be decided by a top-four primary</a> wherein each voter will cast a single vote for a ballot that features all candidates, regardless of party, and the top-four finishers will advance to the general election where ranked-choice voting will decide the winner. It’s likely Murkowski and Tshibaka advance to the general, though, and this is where the real action will take place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, the GOP primary in Arkansas has attracted notice because Sen. John Boozman’s principal opponent, Army veteran and former NFL player Jake Bequette, has managed to raise <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=ARS2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> while a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00790071/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super PAC backing him</a> has also brought in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/14/arkansas-senator-boozman-gop-megadonor-516043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 million in funding from Uihlein</a>, the big-time GOP donor. Although Boozman has Trump’s backing, Bequette and his allies <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arkansas-senate-race-bequette-boozman-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tried to make the case</a> that Bequette is more pro-Trump than the incumbent. Boozman will probably be fine, but Uihlein’s involvement and Bequette’s fundraising make this race at least a bit interesting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Obviously, there is a lot to keep track of! But critically, these Republican primaries will help shape both key battleground contests that will decide control of the Senate as well as the future makeup of the GOP caucus.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (April 22, 2022, 12:05 p.m.):</strong> An earlier version of this article mistakenly described a Nevada primary survey as an internal poll released by the Laxalt campaign.

<p data-paragraph="main">Today is 4/20, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/19/18484698/what-is-420-meaning-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the holiday</a> for stoners and weed enthusiasts around the world. Legalizing marijuana is no longer a fringe issue championed mainly by those partaking in the day’s festivities either. Over the past two decades, we’ve seen a remarkable rise in support for legalization. Polls over the past year from <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civiqs</a>, Quinnipiac and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/356939/support-legal-marijuana-holds-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> show that roughly 7 in 10 American adults think the use of cannabis should be legal, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double the share</a> who thought so 20 years ago. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, a majority of registered voters in all 50 states now favor making cannabis legal, according to <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;map=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-level polling data from Civiqs</a>. Support ranges from a low of 52 percent in North Dakota to a high of 81 percent in Vermont and Washington. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Most adults in every state think marijuana should be legal" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/10pY7/14/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="595" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This widespread support is rapidly changing the landscape of marijuana prohibition, too. Just 10 years ago, the use and distribution of cannabis for recreational purposes was illegal across the entire country. But since 2012, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/where-is-pot-legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized the recreational use of marijuana</a>, and <a href="https://boardroom.tv/cannabis-legalization-by-state-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful more are expected to follow soon</a>. This month, meanwhile, the U.S. House <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-set-pass-legislation-decriminalizing-marijuana/story?id=83763719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed legislation</a> that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Not everyone is on board with those policy changes, though. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/3-republicans-legalize-marijuana-cannabis-2-democrats-vote-against-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over 200 House Republicans voted against the legislation</a>, while only three voted for it. (By comparison, over 200 House Democrats voted for the legislation, while only two voted against it.) That partisan opposition means the bill will <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weed-legalization-unlikely-to-pass-senate-180550123.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost certainly die in the U.S. Senate</a>. After all, Democrats need at least 10 GOP senators to join them in breaking a filibuster. Moreover, even less-controversial marijuana legislation — such as allowing cannabis-related businesses access to the banking system — has <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/02/07/house-takes-its-sixth-hit-on-cannabis-banking-provisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly failed</a> among Republicans in the Senate. With <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/several-gop-senators-oppose-legalizing-pot-following-more-act-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several GOP senators</a> already expressing their disapproval of the bill, this legislation is likely destined to suffer the same fate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">GOP lawmakers’ ongoing opposition to legalization is clearly at odds with the viewpoints of many Americans, as most voters now support legalizing marijuana for recreational use. But congressional Republicans are also increasingly out of step with their own rank-and-file members, as it’s <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;net=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans disproportionately driving</a> the most recent uptick in support for legalizing marijuana, according to polling from Civiqs.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Opponents of legalization are at odds with voters of all parties" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5E7Zm/14/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, you can see in the chart above that Republicans are still much more likely than Democrats or independents to oppose marijuana legalization. But net support for legalizing marijuana also rose twice as much among Republicans as it did among Democrats and independents over the past four years. Since April 1, 2018, net support for legal cannabis (support for legalization minus opposition to legalization) increased by 11 percentage points and 13 points among Democrats and independents, respectively. Republicans’ net support for legalization, in the meantime, grew from -15 points at the start of April 2018 to a high of +13 points at the end of March. (As of Sunday, net support among Republicans was +12 points.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other polling indicates solid GOP support for legalization, too. A 62 percent majority of Republicans surveyed by <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release?releaseid=3809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac</a> in 2021 said that marijuana should be made legal in the U.S., a whopping +30 points in net support. In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/356939/support-legal-marijuana-holds-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> poll conducted the same year, Republicans were split on the issue, with net support for legalization at +1. <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/cannabis_legal?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;map=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statewide polling from Civiqs</a> similarly found that more Republicans favor legal cannabis than oppose it in almost every state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So why exactly, then, aren’t more congressional Republicans representing their own voters’ views on this issue? One possibility is that many of these lawmakers simply don’t know how much Republicans’ opinions have changed. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/bias-in-perceptions-of-public-opinion-among-political-elites/2EF080E04D3AAE6AC1C894F52642E706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political science research shows</a> that politicians tend to overestimate their constituents’ support for conservative policies, with Republican lawmakers driving much of this phenomenon. Some congressional Republicans may therefore oppose federal legalization because they mistakenly believe they’re representing their own voters’ views.       </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other members, however, are likely voting based on their <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/27/republicans-weed-496390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own personal opposition</a> to marijuana legalization. Compared with most Americans, congressional Republicans tend to be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/politics/congress-age/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/01/04/faith-on-the-hill-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more religious</a>, two demographic groups that are far more averse to legalization than <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/16/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-recreational-or-medical-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/religious-americans-are-less-likely-to-endorse-legal-marijuana-for-recreational-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religiously unaffiliated Americans</a>. Indeed, GOP politicians often oppose drug legalization on behalf of conservative principles like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/jeff-sessionss-war-marijuana.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">morality</a>, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/gop-congresswomans-marijuana-legalization-bill-draws-fire-from-home-state-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> and <a href="https://cnsnews.com/article/washington/emily-robertson/sens-cruz-lankford-cannabis-harmful-there-human-cost-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family values</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of the reasons, though, Democrats would be wise to make congressional Republicans’ opposition to marijuana legalization an issue in the upcoming midterm elections. As I noted two years ago, not only is legalization <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/20/why-joe-biden-could-swing-votes-by-campaigning-legalize-marijuana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular across the political spectrum</a>, but political science research shows that it’s also one of the more important issues to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/upshot/impeachment-biggest-issue-voters-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats, Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/upshot/independent-voters-important-issues.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independents</a>. Every 4/20, in fact, it becomes more and more apparent that marijuana legalization is a winning political issue.     </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (April 19, 10:05 a.m.):</strong> Late Monday, former President Trump <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/greenville/politics/trump-backs-timmons-norman-in-sc-congressional-races/article_a6c7cec0-bf5e-11ec-9da7-1bd679e0ca2f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced two more endorsements</a> in a pair of South Carolina House races. With these endorsements, Trump has endorsed 103 candidates for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state governorships so far. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Read more from Jean and Nathaniel on Trump’s 2022 endorsement strategy.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Normally, a one-term presidency would be a sign for a political party to move away, regroup and pivot away from a losing brand. But Donald Trump is not a conventional former president. With the 2022 primary season beginning to pick up in earnest — not counting Texas’s runoff elections, 12 more states will be holding their primaries in May — Trump’s continued influence in the GOP is again being put to the test.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s tricky for Trump, though, as he must thread the needle of maintaining his hold on the party while at the same associating his name with winning — in other words, not reminding voters of his 2020 election loss. He’s largely done this by backing some candidates who seem sure bets to win their primaries as well as supporting his fiercest allies, those who advocate the Big Lie (the idea that he actually won the 2020 election). We last <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-2022-endorsements-are-earlier-bolder-and-more-dangerous-than-when-he-was-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked at Trump’s endorsements back in December</a>, and while many parts of his strategy appear to be the same — namely, he’s still endorsing a <em>lot</em> of candidates — there are signs that Trump is being more selective in who he backs.</p>



<h2><strong>Trump’s endorsements show no sign of slowing down</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">When we took a look at Trump’s endorsements last year, we observed he was endorsing more candidates early on in the cycle. By Dec. 7, 2021, he had endorsed 46 candidates for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state governorships<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including state Rep. Steve Carra, who has since dropped out of his congressional race, and Rep. Mo Brooks, whom Trump has since un-endorsed for Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> — more than three times as many as he had endorsed at that point in the 2020 election cycle. It wouldn’t have been surprising, then, to see the former president take an endorsement breather — but that’s not what happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Trump has continued to endorse at a furious pace. As of April 18, he has endorsed 103 Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> whereas by April 18, 2020, he had endorsed only 42 candidates for those offices.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Trump has doubled down on early endorsements" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qTaBe/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="449" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">After a brief plateau in January — Trump endorsed only six Senate, House or gubernatorial candidates — Trump really ramped up his endorsements in the new year. He endorsed more such candidates in February (20) than he has in any other month this cycle. Then he endorsed nine candidates in March, and 14 more in the first 18 days of April. In total, he’s now made almost as many endorsements for Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates in the first few months of 2022 (49) than he did in all of 2021 (55).<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a></p>



<h2><strong>But Trump is making safer endorsements</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump may not be slowing down in his endorsements, but we have observed a change in strategy. Back in December, we noted that almost half of the endorsements Trump had made to that point carried political risk: 43 percent (20 out of 46) of his Senate, House and governor endorsements<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> were of non-incumbents in contested Republican primaries, meaning they weren’t necessarily locks to win. But since then, only 22 percent (13 out of 59) of Trump’s Senate, House and governor endorsements have been of non-incumbents in contested Republican primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, Trump has been loading up on “safe” endorsements, like on April 6 when he endorsed seven incumbent Republican representatives, none of whom are especially likely to lose their primaries. (Incumbents <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely lose in primaries</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, this was a return to form for Trump, who endorsed only 25 non-incumbents in contested Senate, House and governor primaries in the 2020 cycle — 22 percent of his total endorsements for those offices. Perhaps he realized that, after endorsing so many candidates who may very well lose, he needed to bet on some safer horses in order to maintain the appearance that he is still a kingmaker in Republican primaries. After all, we know he still cares about that perception because he boasted just last month about his <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2022/03/05/trump-boasts-he-went-33-0-in-texas-primary-ignoring-ag-ken-paxton-and-four-others-who-face-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 percent win rate in the Texas primary</a> (if you ignore that five of his endorsees were forced into runoffs). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as we’ve written in the past, Trump’s high win rate has always been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificially inflated by easy wins</a>, and Texas was no exception: Seven of the 19 Republicans Trump endorsed for House or governor in the Lone Star State were running unopposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, Trump may even be selectively changing his endorsements after making them to keep his win rate up and distance himself from candidates he’s afraid might lose. Take Rep. Mo Brooks, who in <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/endorsement-of-mo-brooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 2021</a> earned Trump’s endorsement for U.S. Senate in Alabama but has been <a href="https://www.wbrc.com/2022/03/22/durant-leads-britt-with-brooks-distant-3rd-exclusive-new-gray-tvala-daily-news-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing at a distant third in the polls</a>. Reports began to emerge that Trump was <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/598808-trump-mulls-rescinding-endorsement-of-brooks-in-alabama-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with Brooks’s performance</a>, and on March 23, he officially <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/03/trump-pulls-mo-brooks-endorsement-new-alabama-senate-endorsement-coming-soon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rescinded his endorsement</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Trump is endorsing more Big Lie supporters</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s abandonment of Brooks is interesting, as Trump has largely been endorsing Republicans who agree with his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. On that front, Brooks is one of the Big Lie’s biggest supporters. Brooks was <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2020/12/02/the-gops-electoral-mischief-491033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first member of Congress</a> who said he would challenge the election results, and he also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/10/mo-brooks-jan6-eric-swalwell-lawsuit-insurrection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke at the Jan. 6 rally</a> before the attack on the U.S. Capitol. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what it means to support the Big Lie is an ever-evolving litmus test, and Brooks seems to have made a grievous miscalculation in telling his supporters to put Trump’s 2020 election loss behind them at an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9ZxQsggbM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 2021 rally</a>. <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-kgcbf8ez9e1768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump cited this</a> as the reason for why he was no longer supporting Brooks, though of course it’s impossible to disentangle the role Brooks’s sagging poll numbers played in Trump’s decision, as we know Trump <a href="https://time.com/6160419/donald-trump-mo-brooks-un-endorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loves a winner</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Brooks’s fall from grace aside, a belief in the Big Lie has been perhaps the most consistent part of Trump’s endorsements since the 2020 election. Of the 111 candidates he’s endorsed for governor, federal office, attorney general or secretary of state,<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Carra and Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> at least 80 — more than 70 percent — believe that the 2020 election was fraudulent, according to our research. (To make our determinations, we checked whether Trump’s endorsees had, if members of Congress, voted against certifying the election results, and whether they had taken a public stance on the issue via news reports and their social media pages. Candidates who more generally raised questions about voter fraud or wanted to increase scrutiny of voting practices weren’t included in our totals.)</p>

 <p>To determine whether a candidate supported Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 election, we checked whether Trump’s endorsees had voted against certifying the election results and whether they had taken a public stance on the issue via news reports and their social media pages.</p>
 <p>Sources: donaldjtrump.com, news reports</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">Support for the Big Lie is particularly prominent in the candidates Trump has endorsed for the House, as we identified that 81 percent (58 out of 72) of the candidates Trump has backed believe in the Big Lie.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Carra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> In Trump’s endorsements for Senate and governors’ races, though, support for the Big Lie isn’t quite as pronounced. Just six out of the 17 candidates Trump has endorsed for the Senate support the Big Lie, and nine out of 14 gubernatorial candidates do.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as we wrote in December, what’s really notable about Trump’s endorsements this cycle is he’s also taking the unusual step of endorsing election officials — most notably, election officials who buy into Trump’s lie that the election was stolen from him. So far, Trump has endorsed three secretary of state candidates (all Big Lie believers) in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, states that flipped from Trump in 2016 to President Biden in 2020, and where all three incumbent secretaries of state <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-08/secretaries-of-state-election-security-trump-michigan-georgia-arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certified their state’s results</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump has taken a similar approach in attorney general races, where four out of five of his endorsed candidates believe that the 2020 election was fraudulent. His two incumbent endorsees, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/10/politics/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-supreme-court-case/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Paxton</a> in Texas and <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/12/09/floridaa-ashley-moody-backs-texas-challenge-election-results/3871989001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashley Moody</a> in Florida, both joined a failed lawsuit that tried to overturn the election results, and two non-incumbent endorsees also hail from states Trump narrowly lost in 2020, Georgia and Michigan. (The fifth endorsee, Tim Griffin, an attorney general candidate in Arkansas, hasn’t taken a stance on the 2020 election publicly.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These endorsements are notable, not only because these races don’t usually attract national attention, but because they also most clearly break with Trump’s pattern of choosing safer, incumbent candidates. Of the eight candidates Trump has endorsed so far for secretary of state or attorney general, six are non-incumbents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it’s still an open question at this point about how consequential Trump’s endorsements will be. Most Republicans still have a favorable view of Trump, but there are signs <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/10/politics/donald-trump-republican-primary-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his popularity is slipping</a>. Moreover, we’ve already gotten some mixed signals with his endorsement track record. In the three special elections Trump weighed in on last year, his preferred candidate <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/29/jake-ellzey-donald-trump-texas-6-congressional-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost in Texas</a>, but <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/government/elections-local/gop-candidate-endorsed-by-trump-wins-ohio-15th-congressional-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won in Ohio</a> and <a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/03/20/trump-backed-julia-letlow-wins-special-election-for-seat-late-husband-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana</a>. His endorsement record could be further complicated this year, too, if he continues to rescind endorsements as he did with Brooks or endorse competing candidates <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/03/11/trump-endorses-huizenga-reelection-4th-district/7009427001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like he did with state Rep. Steve Carra and U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga</a> in Michigan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too early at this point to conclude anything about Trump’s endorsement track record, but as we keep moving through the primary season, we’ll be keeping a close eye on what Trump’s endorsements mean for the future of the Republican Party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The San Francisco Chronicle <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/dianne-feinstein-senate-17079487.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an article</a> on Thursday in which a number of Democratic lawmakers and aides suggested that, at age 88, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein was no longer fit to serve due to a significant decline in mental acuity. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses the politically thorny issue of mental acuity in an increasingly elderly U.S. government and what Americans think about age limits for public office.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also continue to track the types of candidates former President Trump has endorsed in the 2022 Republican primaries. So far, he has endorsed over 100 Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates, which is not only more than he endorsed as president in 2020 but also highly unusual for a former president. One of the common themes among the candidates he’s thrown his weight behind is that they have sown distrust in the results of the 2020 election. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-oklahoma-law-87880e9f3c7bde2ae634cb2f02839e6e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a law</a> outlawing abortion in the state. If it isn’t blocked by the courts, the legislation — which has no exceptions for rape or incest — would be one of the harshest measures to become law at a time when anti-abortion lawmakers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2022/abortion-rights-protections-restrictions-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but competing with each other</a> to pass new restrictions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in a sense, Oklahoma legislators who want to end abortion don’t have much more to do in their state. New data exclusively analyzed by FiveThirtyEight shows that it’s already very difficult to get an abortion appointment in Oklahoma — and it has nothing to do with the state’s new ban. Ever since the Supreme Court allowed a highly restrictive abortion law <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to go into effect</a> in Texas last September, Oklahoma’s four abortion clinics <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-business-texas-oklahoma-65225decf918b820801d162f14b09b80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been overrun</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/us/oklahoma-abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demand from out-of-state patients</a>. When a team of academic researchers posed as pregnant people and called the Oklahoma clinics at the beginning of March, all four told the callers they couldn’t schedule them for an appointment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is the case for all the data, it’s possible that someone calling at another time would have gotten a different answer. When FiveThirtyEight reached out to the four Oklahoma clinics last week, one administrator said in an email, “Our wait times at the beginning of March for the [abortion] pill was about 3 weeks and for surgical procedure about 3-4 weeks. … We did not stop scheduling at any point.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless, the impact of the Texas ban isn’t just being felt in Oklahoma. According to the research, waits of two or three weeks for an abortion appointment are common in eight states surrounding Texas — much longer than the waits in states further away.</p>

Doing so would open the door for many more states to restrict abortion and would likely overwhelm the facilities in neighboring states — clinics that are often overburdened as it is.<strong> </strong>A ruling that limits or overturns abortion rights would disturb the fragile equilibrium abortion providers have created, throwing the entire system into chaos. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight analyzed wait-time data for hundreds of abortion providers collected by Middlebury College economics professor <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/econ/faculty_staff_officehours/node/52341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caitlin Myers</a> and <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/txpep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin</a>.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myers has testified as an expert witness on behalf of abortion-rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> To get a comprehensive picture of how long people must wait for the procedure, Myers and a team of student researchers at Middlebury called 737 abortion facilities in 44 states and the District of Columbia, which represent most of the country’s providers that publicly advertise abortion.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://osf.io/8dg7r/wiki/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Myers’s Abortion Facility Database&lt;/a&gt; identifies the names and locations of all facilities that publicly advertise abortion services or might otherwise be identifiable to people looking for an abortion. The database is up to date as of February 23, 2022. Occasionally, when facilities were difficult to reach by phone, the researchers checked appointment availability via the facility’s online scheduler, if it had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> Data for 42 additional providers in the remaining six states came from researchers at the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2021/11/TxPEP-brief-SB8-inital-impact.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have been conducting similar surveys</a> of abortion providers in these states since Texas’s ban went into effect.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myers’s survey protocol was based on the Texas Policy Evaluation Project’s protocol to ensure that the results were comparable. She combined her research with their research, rather than calling the clinics herself, to avoid unnecessarily burdening providers with additional calls. In total, 34 clinics (4 percent) refused to provide appointment information and 20 clinics (3 percent) said they provided abortion but could not schedule an appointment. Most of the calls from both sets of researchers were made between March 1 and March 22, 2022, but some data from a handful of clinics in Maine was collected on April 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> In the calls, the researchers posed as potential patients, saying they were about six weeks pregnant and wanted the soonest possible appointment for an abortion.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The callers identified themselves as local to the area and between the ages of 19 and 24. They asked for the earliest appointment for both medication and surgical abortions. The wait time was calculated based on the soonest available appointment for either type of abortion. For clinics where a pre-abortion consultation was required, the wait time was calculated based on the soonest available appointment for a consultation, plus any state-imposed waiting period. In some cases, patients may end up waiting longer than the state’s required minimum time between consultation and procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The data shows that while clinics in the states surrounding Texas are particularly taxed right now, wait times of a week or more are already fairly common in other parts of the U.S., even in deep-blue states like California and New York.<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of metropolitan areas (or core-based statistical areas) was conducted using 2020 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Nineteen providers were not in a metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

People in red states won’t be the only ones affected if Roe v. Wade is overturned. “States where abortion is still legal will become destinations for people seeking abortions, and the residents of those states will find it hard to get appointments too,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For now, some abortion providers could get patients in quickly — but not many. Only 19 percent of the providers had appointments on the same day or the next weekday.<a data-footnote-id="24" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the story, we refer to weekdays. Not all of the clinics were called on the same day of the week, and some clinics may be closed on weekends. We’ve chosen to exclude weekend days to allow for a more accurate comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a> More providers were able to offer an appointment between two and five weekdays (42 percent). But one-third (32 percent) of clinics had a wait time of at least a week, including 12 percent where the first available appointment was more than two weeks away.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="964" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="1216" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png?w=620 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fuong.atd_.ABORTION-WAIT-TIMES-4m.png?w=1240 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">There are some factors that may not be captured in the data. In addition to the fact that availability can shift from day to day, it’s possible that clinics might have worked to squeeze in a patient further along in her pregnancy, which means that waits might have been shorter in some cases. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a dozen states</a> require an in-person counseling appointment before an abortion, and some clinics gave the researchers a date for the consultation but not a date for when the abortion would take place. So there might be even more of a delay if the procedure couldn’t be scheduled right away. Other unpredictable changes can also have an effect — for example, a spokesperson for several clinics in Delaware said waits were longer that week because various doctors’ vacations and leaves coincided.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it was clear that many of the country’s abortion providers are already stretched thin. Myers told me that it surprised her “how much time [the researchers] spent dealing with busy phone lines, returning dropped calls, being on hold for half an hour or more, being told to try back later.” Those challenges — much like a state’s abortion restrictions — are especially burdensome for low-income people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even a delay of a week can have a serious impact on a person seeking an abortion, according to <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/liza-fuentes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liza Fuentes</a>, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. For one thing, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medication abortion</a> is available at many clinics through the 10th week of pregnancy — after that, patients can get only an in-clinic procedure, which might not be their preference. And it seems likely that if delays mount, more patients will get abortions <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/txpep/releases/wait-times-release.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in their second trimester</a>. That’s relevant because <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the price of an abortion also generally goes up</a> as the pregnancy progresses, particularly after the first trimester, <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/treatments/surgical-abortion-second-trimester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the procedure gets more complicated</a>. And although abortion is extremely safe overall, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0968-8080%2808%2931379-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the risk of complications is a little higher</a> later in pregnancy. “By delaying the procedure, we’re forcing pregnant people to take on additional risks,” Fuentes said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the clinics with the longest wait times are in states where abortion is heavily restricted. The first available appointment at Missouri’s lone clinic, for example, was more than a month away. In Arkansas, where there are only two clinics, the earliest appointment was nearly three weeks away. That’s a huge increase from September, when, <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2022/03/TxPEP-out-of-state-SB8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project’s data</a>, a person seeking an abortion in Arkansas could get an appointment the next day. “It was already hard to provide abortion those states,” said <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science/amanda-stevenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda Stevenson</a>, a sociology professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder who has previously worked on research related to abortion wait times. She reviewed a summary of the analysis before publication. “The fact that the waits aren’t even longer is the result of herculean efforts on the part of providers around Texas to accommodate the increased demand.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It took a few months after the Texas ban went into effect, but Williams’s clinic is now stretched far beyond its normal operating capacity, she said. Like many abortion providers in the South and Midwest, Little Rock Family Planning Services isn’t open every day. Abortion is highly regulated in Arkansas, so adding more appointments means more work to ensure the clinic is in compliance, and it’s hard to find and train more staff in a short time, particularly in the midst of broader shortage of health care workers. And then there are physical-space limitations. “There are only so many people you can fit in the building,” Williams said, adding that the whole situation is profoundly stressful for her, the clinic staff and the people they’re trying to serve. “It’s this ever-increasing thing that you’re chasing,” she said. “There’s just not enough appointments to service the patients who are needing care.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Roe is overturned or restricted this year, many abortion providers will find themselves in a similar position. After all, abortion clinics are businesses built around the demand they expect to have. A sudden, unpredictable influx of patients isn’t easy to accommodate, even in states less restrictive than Arkansas. “There’s a lot of science that goes into the appointment-making,” said <a href="https://www.wholewomanshealth.com/message-from-our-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Hagstrom Miller</a>, the CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which has clinics in Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Texas and Virginia. “We don’t want to make people have a super long wait time. We don’t want to have people sitting on the floor. You want to maintain a commitment to health care with dignity and respect.” Finding a new space to see patients can be difficult. Some providers are expanding their services through telemedicine, but that still takes time and additional personnel. Nothing about offering more abortions is easy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The uncertainty of what the Supreme Court will do — and how many patients will need care — adds another layer of complication. “It feels like without knowing what’s coming, you’re behind,” said Dr. Kristina Tocce, medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. “Because you can’t build out elaborate plans without knowing what’s actually needed.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Further restricting abortion will affect people all over the country, including in blue states. In fact, that may already be happening. Even in states where abortion access is protected, there were clinics with long waits in the data we analyzed. Thirty-one percent of clinics in New York and 67 percent of clinics in Oregon, for example, had a wait time of more than a week. This was particularly pronounced for clinics in rural areas, but more densely populated areas weren’t immune. In seven metropolitan areas — about 3 percent of metro areas with clinics — there were no abortion clinics scheduling an appointment at the time researchers contacted them. In an additional 30 metropolitan areas — about 13 percent — the earliest appointment was more than two weeks away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Chicago, the median wait time for an appointment was almost a week, and three of the city’s 14 abortion providers didn’t have an opening for more than two weeks.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the 14 did not provide scheduling information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/hillary-mclaren" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Hillary McLaren</a>, an abortion provider in Chicago, told me that her clinic has seen an uptick in patients from Texas over the past few months. These days, she said, it’s common for the earliest appointment to be two weeks away. “Chicago is a big city with a lot of abortion access, but we’re surrounded by states where it’s restricted — Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan,” she said. As more people travel to Chicago for abortions, that means fewer appointments for local patients. “We’re already seeing that ripple effect — patients who are based here are less able to get care,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Colorado, the competition for appointments was even more intense. Two of the state’s 21 clinics had no openings at all, and the median wait for an appointment was over a week. This is almost certainly related to the Texas ban. According to data shared with FiveThirtyEight, Planned Parenthood’s Colorado clinics saw 44 patients from Texas between September 2020 and March 2021. During the same period a year later, they saw 506 Texas patients. For clinics that see a couple dozen patients per day, that kind of increase can be very hard to handle, and the lag in appointment availability is likely affecting Colorado residents too, potentially even forcing them to seek care outside their state. “I’ve had colleagues in other states telling me that for the first time in their careers, they’re seeing patients from Colorado coming to their clinics,” Tocce said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The turmoil that the Texas ban has caused underscores just how messy things could get, depending on what the Supreme Court does in a few months. Many more states <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will outlaw abortion</a>, given the chance. And if that happens, long waits are likely to become the new normal, adding to the difficulties that people trying to get an abortion will face. Some people may not be able to get an abortion at all. “There’s just no way that 20 states can care for the people that currently are getting care in 50 states,” Hagstrom Miller said. “Providers can do as much as we can to jump through all the hoops, open our doors, build capacity — but we cannot fix this problem.”</p>
