<p data-paragraph="main">On a Saturday morning in early October, Joe S.,<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe declined to give his last name because he wanted to protect his privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> an Uber driver in his 40s, was in Freedom Park in East Las Vegas, waiting for his kid’s soccer game to start. Bags and equipment were piled near his sneakered feet as he turned to the woman he was with, who was watching another game then on the field, and said he was voting for “anybody but the Democrats.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When I heard him say that, I approached him and asked him why. He responded with a mix of local issues and the economy: He blamed Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak and other Democratic leaders for teacher shortages and high gas prices, which were especially painful since they ate into his earnings as a driver. Abortion, which he heard the Democrats talking about, was a nonissue, he said. It should be up to the states, and is already protected in Nevada. “Right now you can have an abortion up to childbirth in some places,” he said, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/gop-claim-that-democrats-support-abortion-up-moment-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeating a common and misleading Republican claim</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three hours later and 9 miles away, I was in front of the Bellagio Fountain on the Strip with a small group of protesters. Local and Women’s March groups <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/08/womens-march-dc-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staged protests around the country</a> that day in support of the right to abortion access, but the Nevada women who gathered feared their state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely close Senate race</a> could tip the balance against abortion rights. And they worried that not enough people knew about it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think there’s a group of people that stay well informed and are on top of it, and they know what’s at stake, and then there’s the masses that are kind of oblivious to really how bad this is,” said Theresa Barber, a 55-year-old parts manager for a restaurant supply company who stayed at the march until the early evening, after most of the rest of the crowd of about 100 had left. She’d made a sign — Regulate Dick Not Jane — and told me she’d even tried to convince a worker at a Wendy’s drive-through to vote. “I mean, it’s bad,” she said. “We are right on the edge of losing everything.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Everything feels existential to voters in this midterm election year, and it’s no different in Nevada. The state’s Senate race, between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a toss-up</a> that could determine control of the chamber. And the race, like so many others across the country, has largely played out as a tug of war between protecting women’s rights and alleviating economic pain. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans nationwide have campaigned against Democrats’ record on the economy, and it’s been no different in Nevada.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1243930050-3X2.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Republicans nationwide have campaigned against Democrats’ record on the economy, and it’s been no different in Nevada. <p>MELINA MARA / THE WASHINGTON POST / GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For Republicans, soaring gas and grocery prices have revitalized decades-old attacks on Democrats’ approach to the economy as a threat to individual prosperity. For Democrats, the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has pushed them to argue that women’s rights could erode further if Republicans gain control of the Senate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polling</a> tells us the top issues on voter’s minds are inflation and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/404243/economy-top-election-issue-abortion-crime-next.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a>. But elections aren’t that simple. Candidates matter. Local conditions matter. Turnout matters. Over five days in Nevada, I saw all of those were swirling as one of the tightest races in the country barrels toward the finish line. Everywhere I went, things kept coming back to that tug-of-war between two seemingly unrelated issues. Nevada, whose economy was hard-hit by the pandemic and whose voters strongly support abortion rights, is a microcosm of the major issues defining this election year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Ana Olivas, a 35-year-old whom I met at a Latina business leaders breakfast, put it, “To me, I think human rights are No. 1, and then [the] economy is second. And somehow that’s always the two things that I feel like are in battle.”  </p>

But then came the June Supreme Court decision overturning Roe V. Wade, and early signs suggested the unpopular decision might drive voters who were angry about it to the polls. And in August, <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article263946446.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unexpectedly high turnout helped defeat a proposed constitutional</a> amendment in Kansas that would have allowed the state’s legislature to restrict abortion rights, suggesting Democrats had a path toward real electoral gains in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, the public <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/October-2022-ABC-news-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trusts Democrats on abortion</a>, and the issue was soaring in importance nationally. According to the ongoing <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a> using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, in April, 6 percent of likely voters<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined as respondents who were “certain or almost certain” to vote in the 2022 midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> listed it as one of the most important issues for the country, but that number rose to 19 percent after the decision to overturn Roe.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all six waves of the ongoing panel survey conducted between April and October, respondents were asked about the most important issues in three different ways, with the last being a multiple-choice question where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20 (including “other” or “none of these”) that they thought were most important to the country. The sample is weighted to match the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> The share of likely voters who chose it as one of the country’s top issues dipped again in the months following, but it remains higher than where it started, with 11 percent citing it as a top issue in October. Among all respondents, the trends are fairly similar, as shown in the following chart: </p>

Voters trust the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/October-2022-ABC-news-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Party more on economic issues</a>, and with the Dobbs decision further removed, the race has tightened nationally and in Nevada.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1310" height="1064" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-04-at-5.37.16-PM.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Cortez Masto is betting that abortion is still an issue that can power Democrats over the finish line. By mid-October, Democrats and outside groups <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/17/abortion-is-central-issue-arizona-nevada-senate-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had spent nearly $6.2 million</a> in ads in favor of abortion rights to support Cortez Masto, according to a Washington Post analysis. On Laxalt’s side, only about $391,000 had been spent on the issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cortez Masto has warned that if Republicans control the Senate, they could pass a national abortion ban, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/grahams-proposed-total-national-abortion-ban-quickly-meets/story?id=89820730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like one proposed in September by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham</a> that would prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. “The current legislation introduced by Senator Graham stops the people in pro-choice states like mine, like Nevada, from choosing to protect the rights of women,” she said <a href="https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/news/press-releases/on-senate-floor-cortez-masto-calls-out-republican-efforts-to-pass-a-national-abortion-ban-override-nevadans-right-to-choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Senate floor</a>. It’s an issue Cortez Masto talks about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV4biJq5Sq4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English-</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWdN8yS0AT8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish-language</a> ads, in press conferences, in speeches and in meetings with Nevada voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s clear where Nevadans stand — and have stood. In 1990, a referendum protecting abortion up to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_7,_Abortion_Legal_to_24_Weeks_Statute_Referendum_(1990)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 weeks passed with 63 percent of the vote</a>, and an May 2022 analysis by The New York Times estimated that the same percentage of adults in the state still supports access to legal abortion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/upshot/polling-abortion-states.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making it one of the most pro-choice states</a> in the country. In September, an Emerson College poll <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/nevada-2022-us-senate--gubernatorial-elections-in-statistical-dead-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found that abortion access was the second-most important issue to Nevada likely voters</a>, with 18 percent saying it would determine their vote. </p>

Catherine Cortez Masto has warned that her opponent, Adam Laxalt, could cast deciding votes in the Senate to limit abortion rights nationwide. <p>TY O’NEIL / SOPA IMAGES / LIGHTROCKET / GETTY IMAGES</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s also clear where Laxalt stands, though. He has said abortion regulations are best left to the states, and as Nevada’s attorney general, <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/laxalt-signs-nevada-on-to-support-alabama-abortion-restrictions-had-backed-similar-law-in-texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he signed onto amicus briefs</a> in support of restrictions in other states and said he would support further restriction in Nevada. “A journalist recently asked me if I would support a referendum limiting abortion to the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, essentially, the first trimester,” he wrote in an August op-ed in the <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2022/08/02/setting-record-straight-adam-laxalt/10187587002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reno Gazette-Journal</a>. “I said that I would, and I stand by that view. I also believe that most Nevadans agree with that position.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps because of the contrast between his views and those of his potential constituents, Laxalt has largely focused on inflation during the campaign, <a href="https://www.adamlaxalt.com/post/biden-cortez-masto-agenda-causes-another-gas-price-spike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly high gas prices.</a> Economic conditions have been especially tough in Nevada. In 2019, more <a href="http://epubs.nsla.nv.gov/statepubs/epubs/31428003050115-2019-84.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than a fifth of the state’s workers</a> were employed by the hospitality industry, which was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing shutdowns. Around three-quarters of the state’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/clarkcountynevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">population lives in and around Las Vegas</a>, which is especially reliant on the industry. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, told me that about 80 percent of their workforce is back. Meanwhile, rent, gas, and grocery prices <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/news-release/consumerpriceindex_west.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> have climbed throughout the Western United States</a>, and energy prices rose 20 percent year-over-year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cortez Masto and other Democrats in the state have acknowledged the economic difficulties but have also essentially said, ‘We were there for you when you needed unemployment and COVID-19 protections, so trust us to see this recovery through.’ “Today, jobs are up, unemployment is down, and American manufacturing is back,” Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/26/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-virtual-fundraiser-with-nevada-congressional-delegation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a virtual fundraiser</a> for the Nevada congressional delegation last week. “But even with all this progress, we know folks are still struggling with inflation. …That’s why we’ve been so determined to reduce everyday costs.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22285741198635-3X2.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Latino voters are a key political bloc every election cycle in Nevada. This year, organizers are worried about turnout. <p>AP PHOTO / JOHN LOCHER</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">But the tough economy is a present reality for Nevadans, while the threat to abortion access that Cortez Masto has pointed to is a future one. This basic tension could help explain the enthusiasm gap we’ve seen between Republican and Democratic voters nationally. For example, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/cnn-poll-gop-congressional-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CNN/SSRS poll</a> from last week found that only 24 percent of Democratic voters said they were enthusiastic about voting, compared with 44 percent in 2018; for Republicans, the decline this year was just 5 percentage points, from 43 percent in 2018 to 38 percent in 2022. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Each candidate is trying to appeal to key voting blocs, not just to sway them, but to convince them to vote at all. In Nevada, that means trying to win Latino voters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a Thursday afternoon, I met up with canvassers from <a href="https://www.somosvotantes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somos Votantes</a>, an independent outreach group that has endorsed Democrats and mobilizes Latino voters, as they knocked on doors of registered voters in a North Las Vegas neighborhood of brown stucco single-family homes. Without trees for shade, the midday sun was at its full power. Sunrise Mountain framed the sky to the east. The canvassers and I walked by one family butchering part of a cow in their driveway for a celebration with friends and family visiting from Texas. Another family chased after a puppy that had escaped from its yard. An ice cream truck driver, lingering for the young children just home from school, saw the canvassers’ signs and started chanting, “Masto! Masto! Masto!”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some voters said they couldn’t vote or that they didn’t pay attention to politics. Some said they needed to do more research. They were generally familiar with Cortez Masto, and many thought they would vote for her but hadn’t quite committed. Another man said Cortez Masto reminded him of Hillary Clinton and that he was voting for the other candidate. Veronica Balentine, a 54-year-old who works in health care, said affordable health care was the most important issue and that voters in the state were hearing a lot of misinformation in ads. Jose Bobadilla, a 30-year-old who’d heard stories about crime in the 1990s, was worried about gun rights. These voters, immersed in their everyday lives, brought their own set of concerns and issues to the election; the back-and-forth of the campaigns felt far away.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22307821143252-3X2.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22307821143252-3X2.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22307821143252-3X2.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22307821143252-3X2.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Whether Democrats maintain control of the Senate could come down to Cortez Masto’s Senate race. <p>AP PHOTO / JOHN LOCHER</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Latinos make up 30 percent of the state’s population, and while a majority <a href="https://www.vegaspbs.org/blogs/nevada-week-season-5/latino-vote-in-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for Biden in 2020</a>, the Republican Party has made <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/election-2022-latino-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inroads with the group nationally</a> and many Latino voters seem <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/a-quarter-of-latino-adults-dont-favor-any-midterm-candidate/?share=facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undecided this year</a>. Whether this key bloc of voters shows up for Democratic candidates, swings toward Republicans or stays home could be a deciding factor. “My biggest thing that’s sort of keeping me up at night is not actually that Latinos are vote-switching, but it’s that the base is going to stay home,” said Melissa Morales, president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, which has endorsed Cortez Masto, the first Latina in the Senate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Morales said the economy is an overriding concern for the voters her organization speaks with, but what that means can vary. People are worried about rising rents and the costs of healthcare and medicine as much as they’re worried about prices at the grocery store — so her organization always opens its door-to-door conversations by talking about cost-of-living issues. “I think there’s obviously the relief that, especially in a state like Nevada, that was the hardest hit by unemployment, that the jobs are back,” Morales said. “They’re able to sort of work to make ends meet. But also the realization that it’s just hard. All of it feels hard.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Morales said that in their focus groups with young Latino voters, abortion remains a top issue. “It has been hard to get them excited or motivated or really sort of mobilized around anything for the past two years,” she said. “But what we’ve seen that’s starting to really take root and with those voters is the abortion and … the climate provisions in the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act].” Overall, Latino voters support <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/16/abortion-latino-issues-voters-midterms-00052119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to abortion by large majorities</a>.

But most voters aren’t extremists. Most voters don’t believe in extremism on the right or extremism on the left.” Perhaps it’s fitting, then, Nevada could be the state that determines the balance of power in a divided Senate amid an increasingly divided country.</p>]]></description>

<p>When Will We Know 2022 Midterm Election Results?A complete guide to poll closing times, vote counting and races to watch in every state.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/">Nathaniel Rakich</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/elena-mejia-lutz/">Elena Mejía</a></p>
<p>When are we going to know the results of the midterms? In 2020, due to slow vote counting in many states, it took days — until Saturday, Nov. 7 — for ABC News to declare Joe Biden the president-elect. We likely won’t have to wait <i>that</i> long this year, but it is again possible that we won’t know the winners of the 2022 election on election night. States like Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania that are key to Senate control could take multiple days to count all their votes.</p>
<p>The exact timing of the results depends on the state; each has different rules for when and how votes are counted. But we can make an educated guess based on when each state reported results in its primary election earlier this year.<a tabindex="0" data-number="1" aria-label="Footnote 1. Select to expand footnote.">1</a> If every state reports its results at the same pace as in the primary, here is how election night (and the following day) will unfold.

<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that the rate of vote counting in the general election will match that of the primary. So we’ve also gathered information from state election officials and Edison Research, which provides live election results to ABC News, about when we can expect 2022 election results.</p>
<p>Even those estimates, though, are not ironclad. If there’s one thing to know about election night, it’s to expect the unexpected. <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-broward-election-audit-2018-brenda-snipes-20200526-rswvxtj2ljasjmfi7w75moo52e-story.html">Human error</a> or <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2020/02/04/iowa-caucus-delayed-results-mean-no-winner-yet-iowa-caucuses/4653022002/">technical difficulties</a> can delay results. Most importantly, if a race is extremely close, it probably won’t be called for days. Even in states that count votes fast, a small number of provisional and absentee ballots aren’t counted until days later. And of course, if a race goes to a recount or is legally challenged, it can take weeks to declare a winner.</p>

The winners won’t officially be known until Nov. 23, when the state conducts its ranked-choice tabulations.</p>

However, in House races where no candidate gets a majority, we won’t know the winners for a while yet. That’s because Maine uses <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/rankedchoicefaq.html">ranked-choice voting</a> for federal elections, and voters’ second- and third-choices will need to be tabulated too. The secretary of state’s office estimates that it will run these tabulations around the middle of the week after Election Day.</p>

(In the primary, it wasn’t until 12:42 a.m. Eastern.) At that point, counties will report the bulk of their results. However, some mail ballots will still be outstanding since Nevada accepts mail ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrive by Nov. 12. Those could matter in a close race.

While Election Day votes are expected to be reported on election night, officials are not allowed to start processing absentee ballots until Tuesday morning. Counting those votes could take days, but there are a few reasons to think <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-2022-election-results-vote-count-timing-20221020.html">it will take less time than it did two years ago</a>. First, it’s likely that fewer absentee ballots will be cast this year than in 2020. Counties are also more experienced and prepared for a large volume of absentees. And most counties are only allowed to stop counting once they’re done. Several counties told the Philadelphia Inquirer that they expect to be mostly done counting by Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>It’s going to take a while. Washington is a vote-by-mail state, and ballots only have to be postmarked by Election Day, not necessarily received by then. Typically, counties report a large batch of votes right after polls close, with hourly updates for the rest of election night. Then, counties report the results of later-arriving ballots at the end of every day until all ballots are counted. This year, the secretary of state’s office is anticipating that between 40 and 50 percent of the vote will be reported on election night, and the vast majority will be reported by Friday. However, the numbers won’t be final until the results are certified on Nov. 29.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are just four days until Election Day. The race for the Senate is still on a knife’s edge and Republicans have a clear advantage in the House. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew talks about which states they expect results from first on election night and how the early voting process is going so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then, they turn to the issues that both parties have spent the most advertising money on and listen to a few examples. Lastly, the team breaks down which candidates who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election are most likely to win their races and how they could impact future elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Earlier this week, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-a-republican-sweep-on-election-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I spoke with Nathan Redd</a>, a “friend” of mine (actually, a fragment of my alter ego) who attempted to convince me that Republicans will do <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even better than the FiveThirtyEight forecast suggests</a>. Today, you’ll meet Nathaniel Bleu, another figment of my imagination who I spoke with at a wine bar in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where he lives with his husband and two French bulldogs. Bleu, an ad sales executive with a major New York publishing company, expressed confidence that Democrats will win, although as you’ll see his confidence was easily shaken. An abbreviated transcript of our conversation follows.</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> Happy election season, Nate. I’ve never seen everyone so terrified.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Well, if I can put on my concerned citizen hat for a moment —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>That looks more like a Detroit Tigers hat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Very funny.<strong> </strong>If I can put on my concerned citizen hat for a moment, there’s good reason to be worried. All those <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election deniers on the ballot</a>. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/02/1133465632/why-conspiracy-theories-about-paul-pelosis-assault-keep-circulating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack on Paul Pelosi</a>. I’m not sure where this leads, but it doesn’t seem like it’s a good place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>That’s not what I’m talking about. I’ve never seen everyone so terrified to admit that Democrats are going to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Ummmmm —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> Even you, Nate. You know I have the utmost respect for you and FiveThirtyEight. Why, I’d have a whole menagerie of Fivey Fox plush dolls if I could. But your forecast has Democrats winning and you’re terrified to admit it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>It very much does <em>not</em> have Democrats winning. Are you reading those <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1585038499908288512?s=20&amp;t=vaPsuc0_SnvuCGmn7ANi6w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake FiveThirtyEight alerts from the DCCC</a>?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>The <em>Deluxe</em> forecast <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has Republicans ahead</a>. But I don’t trust all the subjectivity it introduces —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>For the record, I’m going to object to that characterization of the Deluxe forecast —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> The Lite forecast has Democrats winning. That’s the one I trust.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Lite has them<em> barely</em> ahead in the Senate. And Republicans are closing so quickly, that lead might disappear by the time we get to Tuesday. And that’s to say nothing of the House, where Republicans are heavy favorites. Besides, Deluxe is the better, more accurate product.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I could almost see the grin on your face when Republicans went ahead in Deluxe the other day. It’s just so much <em>safer</em> for you that way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>You think of me as risk-averse? You’re the one who still refuses to eat dinner indoors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Not true. Only during that Omicron surge last winter. Was that the last time we saw each other? Besides, it’s a lovely evening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I can barely feel my toes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>To be fair, it’s not just you. It’s everybody. You and me and everyone in the media. Everybody is terrified of predicting that <em>anything</em> good happens for Democrats, having a replay of 2016 and looking foolish again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>You don’t work in “the media.” You work in ad sales for a media company. Just because you see David Remnick in the Condé Nast cafeteria doesn’t make you Maggie Haberman.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong><em>Somebody</em> needs another glass of wine. The truth is, nobody knows how this election is going to turn out. It’s just people groping around trying to sound smart. It’s the supply of takes meeting the demand for takes. And right now, the take everyone wants is “Republicans are going to win.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I don’t really buy that at all. Turn on MSNBC, and you’ll see <a href="https://twitter.com/thereidout/status/1587251935597445120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of hopium for Democrats about early voting and turnout and whatever else</a>. People like takes that flatter their sensibilities. But I’m not interested in the psychology of your brunchmates. I’m interested in why you think our forecast might be wrong, and you haven’t said a word about that yet. Besides, I expected you to be on Team Gloom. I thought you’d be apoplectic by this point.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I <em>was</em> on Team Gloom. Why, I might as well have been the quarterback. And then I went to Kansas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>What the hell were you doing in Kansas? I know you and Corey were talking about buying a country home, but that’s a long —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Well, Corey grew up in Topeka. So we were out there for “No on 2” — you know, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/us/elections/results-kansas-abortion-amendment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion referendum</a>. We were even doing a little canvassing. I knew that No was going to win, I knew in particular how strongly younger women felt about it. But even I didn’t expect it to win by, what was it, 18 percentage points?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>It was impressive, no doubt. And if Tuesday was some sort of national referendum on <em>Roe</em>, I’m sure Democrats would do pretty well. But —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Let me stop you right there. Because it <em>wasn’t</em> just Kansas. There were a bunch of special elections, too. Are you familiar with the website FiveThirtyEight dot com? Here, I’m going to pull my phone out because I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bookmarked the page</a> just to make sure I got this right. According to Mr. Nathaniel Rakich — lovely first name, by the way — things changed after Roe was overturned. “Since that decision … Democrats have outperformed their expected margins in [four special House elections] by an average of 9 points.” And that doesn’t even count <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-democrats-win-in-alaska-tells-us-about-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaska</a>! You’re telling me Democrats are going to have a bad year when they’re winning elections in Kansas and Alaska?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m telling you that we’re not in Kansas anymore.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’m telling you that Democrats’ position has deteriorated since then. You hold this election in August, and yeah, I think Democrats keep the Senate and maybe even the House. But the polls have been pretty clear in showing a Republican rebound.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>So now we come full circle. Have the polls shifted, or has there been more of a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/02/a-vibe-shift-is-coming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>vibe shift</em></a>? And is the vibe shift real, or is it just an artifact of media coverage? Because I don’t see what’s so different now compared with August.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Nate: </strong>Oh boy, this is starting to sound conspiratorial. And there’s a <em>lot</em> that’s changed since August. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/13/business/inflation-cpi-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bad news on inflation</a>. About a zillion <a href="https://twitter.com/DyjuanTatro/status/1587205829953994752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News segments on crime</a> and “defund the police.” And it’s not really even that Democrats are losing ground so much as that Republicans are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding undecided voters</a>— people who were probably going to vote for them all along. It’s all been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very normal in some sense</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I’m certainly not alleging any conspiracy, or connivance, or cabal. I’m saying that pollsters have incentives, and those incentives run toward giving Republicans the most optimistic numbers they can, because they’ll <a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/719276/why-it-matters-if-the-polls-miss-again/?unlock=G312XOQO4PT6RXHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a ton of grief if they miss high on Democrats again</a>, but nobody will care if they overestimate Republicans by a point or two.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Well, a few things here, because this is quite the claim you’re making. Number one, you could have made exactly the same argument in 2020, and yet the polls had an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even bigger Democratic bias than in 2016</a>! Number two, I’m not sure the incentives are so obvious, and the <em>clearest</em> incentive is that you just want to be accurate. Number three, I think you’re underestimating the pollsters. Sure, some of them are cynical and partisan, but most of them see what they do as a public service —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Why how lovely! Let’s send a fruit basket to the Pew Research Center to thank them for their service! Do you think Trafalgar and Rasmussen care about public service? They’re <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/biden-gap-senate-surveys-00064362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooding the zone</a> with partisan polls!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Actually, they were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the most accurate pollsters in 2020</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I don’t care. A broken clock is right twice a day. You have tons of Republican polls, and no Democratic ones. It’s going to skew the averages.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m not so sure that’s true, at least for FiveThirtyEight. Our model <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a house-effects adjustment</a>, so if a pollster consistently shows overly rosy results for Republicans — or for Democrats, for that matter — it takes that into account. And besides, to your point about incentives, it’s a free market. If there’s a firm with a turnout model that shows great results for Democrats, they can publish those numbers if they have confidence in them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I can tell this whole discussion is making you uneasy. You’ve looked uncomfortable all night. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m just a little chilly. Indoors next time? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Look, it’s not a great situation. As America gets more partisan, and trust in institutions erodes, there are a lot of downstream, negative consequences for pollsters. To start with, most people <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/27/response-rates-in-telephone-surveys-have-resumed-their-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basically don’t answer phone calls from unknown numbers anymore</a>. So people who do answer polls are weird in some sense, and they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/upshot/midterms-polling-phone-calls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may not be representative of the electorate</a>. You used to be able to default to more of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-bad-pollsters-copying-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold standard in polling</a> — it was expensive, but you could do it. Now, there are a lot more choices to make. On top of that, trust in the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403166/americans-trust-media-remains-near-record-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media is about as low as it’s ever been</a>. Does that make pollsters more likely to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-some-pollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stick with the herd</a> instead of publishing numbers that could cause them a lot of grief? Maybe, but I’m not going to make too many assumptions about that until Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>So if we can’t trust the polls, maybe we should look at early voting data instead —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Oh, no no no no no. Let me stop you right there. <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/no-really-dont-pay-attention-to-early-voting-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s a trap</a>. There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/upshot/georgia-election-expect-the-early-vote-count-to-be-misleading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely reliable benchmarks to use</a>, and the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/early-voting-was-a-misleading-indicator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis inevitably reflects people’s partisan priors</a>. About the only person I trust to any degree at all on early voting is Jon Ralston in Nevada, and <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/the-early-voting-blog-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he thinks the numbers there look pretty <em>bad</em> for Democrats</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Have you agreed with a single thing I’ve had to say, Nate? I could once count on you to defy conventional wisdom. Now you sound just like everybody else. What do you <em>really</em> think?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> My least favorite question! I don’t have some private set of beliefs that I keep to myself! I trust our forecast, which is based on a computer program I wrote four years ago and not my mood as I’m sitting here with a glass of pinot! Our forecast says that the Senate is a toss-up at best for Democrats, and the momentum has been with Republicans. But I’m not sure what we’re really arguing about. I agree that the special elections were good for Democrats. And I very much agree that Democrats <em>could</em> beat their polls. It’s an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entirely realistic scenario</a>. But it’s not the likeliest scenario. Besides, the president’s party doing poorly in the midterms would be about the most <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/analyses/the-2022-midterm-elections-what-the-historical-data-suggest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal thing imaginable</a>, especially with inflation at 8 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu:</strong> You keep using that word “normal,” but we’re not in normal times anymore. This country is going to hell.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>So you’re on Team Gloom after all!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>Just tell me there’s a chance, a chance that Democrats keep the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>There’s a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent chance</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Bleu: </strong>I’ll take it.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Ah, Southern California: Movie stars, outrageously good weather, interminable traffic. And recently, a bunch of highly competitive races for the U.S. House of Representatives. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2018, Democrats flipped five Republican-held seats in and around the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas, including four that contained parts of or were entirely within Orange County, the <a href="https://fullertonobserver.com/2020/01/03/remembering-nixonland-how-the-modern-rep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic base of the California GOP</a>. But in 2020, Republicans won back three of those five seats, and this year — in an electoral environment that generally favors them — they’re hoping to not only hold onto those seats, but also capture more districts being defended by Democratic incumbents in Southern California.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, we’re defining Southern California as everything south of San Luis Obispo, Kern and San Bernardino counties, inclusive of those counties, which run west to east across the state. The districts we examined here are located entirely in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Following redistricting</a>, however, there are no surefire pickups for the GOP, as the potentially endangered Democratic incumbents in the region are defending seats that are at least 5 percentage points more Democratic-leaning than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean.<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> As things stand, the Democrats in those seats are favored to win reelection. However, we’ve seen things <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to improve for the GOP nationally</a>: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a> now gives Republicans an 85-in-100 shot<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All figures in this story are based on the “Deluxe” forecast as of 5 p.m. Eastern on Nov. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> of winning a majority in the House. Under these circumstances, the upper-end range of outcomes for the GOP could include wins in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-polling-error/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some blue-leaning seats</a> in Southern California.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond the political environment, Republicans could make inroads in these districts because they <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-07/orange-county-went-for-biden-but-the-blue-wave-might-all-but-disappear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t necessarily as blue as they seem</a> based on <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/four-california-districts-split-tickets-for-president-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2020 presidential vote</a> alone. That’s because some voters in this region are still more inclined to vote Republican down-ballot.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> we can see how this played out in 2020, as the Democratic incumbents mostly ran behind President Biden and the Republican incumbents ran ahead of former President Donald Trump, as the table below shows.</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This degree of Democratic underperformance was atypical. Across the country, Democratic incumbents in the House ran about even with Biden in 2020, on average, although there were plenty who clearly ran ahead or behind him.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on an analysis of the two-party vote for president and House in 178 districts with Democratic incumbents running that had House candidates from both parties who combined to win at least 95 percent of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> But in Southern California, Democratic Reps. Mike Levin, Katie Porter and Julia Brownley all ran 4 to 7 points behind Biden, while only Rep. Raul Ruiz ran ahead of the now-president among the Democratic incumbents we’re looking at here. Meanwhile, most of the Republican incumbents in this group ran ahead of Trump, including the three Republicans who won back Democratic-held seats in 2020 — Republican Reps. Mike Garcia, Young Kim and Michelle Steel. Now, redistricting has changed the district lines since 2020, but we’re talking about Biden-supporting turf that in some cases backed Republican John Cox in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yr9mcAtuUdNjI9NEPYKxXsEldzzQ2ZaDwEAbnPRyS4/edit#gid=1938542161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 gubernatorial race</a>, which now-Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won by 24 points statewide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Among these Democratic incumbents, Levin had the largest gap between how he performed in 2020 versus Biden. Back then, Levin ran against Republican Brian Maryott, whom the Democrat <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-general/sov/24-us-reps.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated by</a> 6 points, 53 percent to 47 percent. Now Levin is facing Maryott again in the 49th District, and as this seat only changed a little bit in redistricting, the race is largely being fought on the same light-blue turf that straddles the coastal border between Orange and San Diego counties — but in a better Republican environment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good news for Levin is that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/49/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast gives</a> him an 86-in-100 shot of winning, buttressed in part by a <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/story/2022-11-01/49th-mike-levin-joe-biden-brian-maryott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late October poll</a> from SurveyUSA/The San Diego Union-Tribune/ABC 10News that found Levin up 49 percent to 43 percent. Still, that result was well inside the margin of error, and the outside spending in this race suggests both parties view it as highly competitive: As of Oct. 24, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and House Majority PAC had spent $3.3 million to aid Levin, while the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee and Congressional Leadership Fund had poured in $3.4 million to help Maryott, according to data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQJRWqwoOQQcs_5mMW2rkuMK8hXB3GgcOhBFj6rJ-wE/edit#gid=1259988719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compiled by Daily Kos Elections</a>. And heading into the final days of the campaign, Levin <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/49/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had</a> over a $1 million to $430,000 edge over Maryott in his campaign account.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Just up the coast is Porter, who in two terms has become a high-profile member of the House thanks to <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/inside-the-issues/2022/08/29/katie-porter-looks-to-hold-gun-manufacturers-accountable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her withering questioning</a> in congressional hearings. Porter ran about 5 points behind Biden in 2020 while winning by 7 points, 53.5 percent to 46.5 percent, but while her new district has a partisan lean (D+6) similar to that of her old turf,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the old 45th District, her previous seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> a majority of the 47th District’s constituents are new to her: Only 41 percent of the people living in Porter’s old seat are in her new one, which is located entirely within Orange County.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Porter has needed to spend money to familiarize voters with her story and her record in Congress. Helpfully for her, though, Porter is one of the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/most-expensive-races?senateraisedcycle=2020&amp;senatespentcycle=2020&amp;housespentcycle=2020&amp;houseraisedcycle=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most prodigious fundraisers</a> in the House, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/47/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $23.0 million and spent $24.4 million this cycle. Entering the last days of the campaign, she had $8.9 million in the bank to Republican Scott Baugh’s $139,000. Still, Republicans haven’t given up here, as the NRCC and CLF have tried to give Baugh a lift with $3.5 million in outside spending. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/47/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our forecast gives</a> Porter a 77-in-100 shot of defeating Baugh. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the suburbs north of Los Angeles, Brownley ran about 4 points behind Biden in 2020, but her largely unchanged district is far bluer than the seats Levin or Porter are running in. As such, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast gives</a> Brownley about a 95-in-100 shot of defeating Republican Matt Jacobs, right on the dividing line between “solid” and “likely” Democratic. Yet <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/27/maloney-dems-new-york-midterms-00063645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent reporting by Politico</a> suggests Brownley is worried: She’s asked Democratic colleagues for financial assistance, based in part on internal polling that shows a close race (we haven’t been able to get our hands on those polls). The NRCC <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/30/republicans-biden-seats-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has now entered the fray</a>, too, as it plans to make a “six-figure” investment in the seat. But Brownley did have about <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/26/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six times as much money</a> in the bank as Jacobs ($1.9 million to $300,000) as of Oct. 19 and remains favored, although she may be in for a closer-than-expected outcome.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To the east, there’ve been few signs that Ruiz is in any danger in the 25th District. Ruiz is the one Democratic incumbent in this group who ran ahead of Biden in 2020, and although his district is a touch less blue than Brownley’s, his race has seen <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CA25&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost no outside spending</a>. Moreover, Ruiz had $2.1 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/25/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his war chest</a> for the last weeks of the campaign, much more than the $19,000 Republican Brian Hawkins had. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our forecast gives</a> Ruiz a 94-in-100 shot of winning, just shy of being rated as solidly Democratic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Turning quickly to the Republicans who might be in danger, the main one is Garcia, who is seeking reelection in the new 27th District north of Los Angeles, which went from about D+5 to D+8 in redistricting.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the old 25th District, the seat’s previous number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> Notably, Garcia is facing Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman, for the third straight time: He defeated her in a May 2020 special election to capture this seat, held the seat in the November 2020 general election <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2020-general/sov/24-us-reps.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by a 333-vote margin</a> and now meets her again in 2022. And a third win could well be on his way: Garcia has a 65 in 100 shot of winning, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per our forecast</a>, and considering he ran 10 points ahead of Trump in 2020, it’s not as surprising he has an edge in this blue-leaning district. Moreover, there’ve been other signs Garcia is well-positioned, including the recent decision by major outside Democratic groups <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1583489245708423168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to cut their ad spending</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have also hoped to make inroads against Kim, Steel and even longtime Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, but each race is rated at least likely Republican in our forecast. On paper, Steel could be in danger in her race against Democrat Jay Chen in the new 45th District — it’s a D+5 seat and she currently represents only 16 percent of its constituents. But Steel <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/CA/45/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has outraised Chen</a> and has received $1.1 million in support from the NRCC and CLF, while Chen has received no outside help from the DCCC or House Majority PAC.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All in all, Democrats are on the defensive in Southern California. And while their most endangered incumbents are running in blue-leaning districts, the Republican-leaning national political environment and the tendency for some voters in this region to vote Republican down-ballot may give the GOP the chance to make further gains in the region.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong> </strong>Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=pollapalooza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, a man broke into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-pelosis-husband-violently-assaulted-san-francisco-home/story?id=92280229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violently attacked her husband</a>, Paul. While Pelosi’s husband is expected to make a full recovery, and details are still emerging about the attack, it was a brutal realization of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/01/us/politics/violent-threats-lawmakers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the increase in threats of violence</a> against lawmakers and their families in recent years. And most disturbingly, recent polling shows that some Americans say political violence is sometimes justified. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polls in recent months have gauged Americans’ views on political violence in a few different ways, but they almost always capture some segment of the population that deems political violence acceptable. When asked whether the use of force or violence was justified “to advance an important political objective,” 1 in 5 Americans said it was, at least sometimes, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1.full-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a survey from researchers at the University of California, Davis</a>, conducted in May and June. And in a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-09/Ipsos%20Poll%20Presidential%20Approval%20Tracker%20and%20Biden%27s%20Speech%2009%2008%202022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos poll from September</a>, 17 percent of Americans somewhat or strongly agreed that political violence against those they disagreed with was acceptable, with slightly more Democrats agreeing with the statement than Republicans or independents. However, just a small fraction of registered voters said taking up arms or a civil war was necessary to fix our democracy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/18/upshot/times-siena-poll-toplines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a recent New York Times/Siena poll</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As striking as some of those results are, some research suggests Americans’ true views are much more passive. Some of these responses can be chalked up to respondents not paying close enough attention, vaguely worded questions or both, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116870119#sec-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in March. The study’s authors found that, when engaged with the survey and presented with specific examples of political violence, between 89 and 100 percent of respondents wanted a suspect in a politically motivated violent crime charged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless, the reality is that threats of political violence are on the rise, and it’s making Americans concerned. When asked whether they were “concerned that extremists will commit acts of violence after the election if they are unhappy with the election outcome,” 64 percent of Americans said they somewhat or strongly agreed, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/americans-continue-to-feel-economic-pressure-with-inflation-remaining-top-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a Reuters/Ipsos poll fielded in October</a>. Similarly, 48 percent of Americans said they were very or somewhat concerned about the possibility of violence associated with the 2022 midterms, according to a <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Midterm2022ToplinesOctoberNational2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UMass/YouGov poll</a> conducted in October. And Black Americans are much more likely than white or Hispanic Americans to expect “displays of violence” related to the midterms, <a href="https://www.grid.news/story/politics/2022/10/17/poll-black-americans-are-most-likely-to-expect-election-violence-this-november-and-its-compelling-them-to-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Grid-Harris poll</a>, also from October. When asked whether they thought election results would spark displays of violence in their area, 40 percent of Black Americans said it was very or somewhat likely, compared to 23 percent of white Americans and 36 percent of Hispanic Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet once again, the sentiments captured in polling don’t necessarily translate to reality. In a recent YouGov/Economist poll, a majority of Americans (51 percent) said they thought it’s very or somewhat likely that there will be violence at polling places this election, but only 30 percent were concerned about it. And in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/midterm-election-voters-democracy-poll.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that New York Times/Siena poll</a>, 71 percent of voters said democracy was at risk in America, but only 7 percent said it was the most important problem facing the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather than embracing political violence as acceptable, Americans are more likely to find ways to downplay the threat. In response to the attack on Pelosi this week, some Republicans and right-wing figures <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/01/paul-pelosi-conspiracy-theories-debunked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been spreading conspiracy theories</a> that the attack was actually the result of a lovers quarrel, a baseless reframing that disregards the possibility that the violence was politically motivated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The broader reality of political violence in the U.S. is much more complex than a single poll question can capture. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/#part1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve reported before</a>, political polarization is leading more Americans to become distrustful, spiteful and even hateful of those who have different political views from them, creating a dangerous environment for democracy and those who would be willing to use violence to dismantle it. The attack last week is a stark reminder that it only takes a single person taking these ideas to the extreme to cause real damage, let alone the thousands we saw on Jan. 6. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>In the run-up to Election Day, the economy continues to be the most pressing political concern for Americans, according to an Oct. 14-18 <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/10/27/inflation-remains-top-issue-for-midterm-voters">poll from Data for Progress</a>. Forty-five percent of likely voters (a plurality) named inflation as one of the top three issues congressional candidates should focus on, while 30 percent said jobs and the economy. Meanwhile, voters were split on which party would be better equipped to address such concerns. While both Republican and Democratic likely voters had more faith in their respective parties, a larger share of independents leaned to the right, with 46 percent saying Republicans would be better equipped to tackle economic issues and inflation. </li><li>A recent <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/10/27/politics-election-vice-news-yougov-polls-oct-2022">YouGov survey conducted for Vice News</a> found that 23 percent of Republicans thought white supremacy extremism is a major problem in the U.S., while 37 percent considered it a minor one. Still, Democrats were far more likely to regard white supremacy extremism as a major (73 percent) or minor (20 percent) issue. </li><li>Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter has elicited a partisan response. A <a href="https://civicscience.com/immediate-insights-republicans-are-bullish-on-elon-musks-twitter-takeover/">CivicScience poll</a> conducted Oct. 28 found that close to half of Republicans (43 percent) said they’ll be more likely to use the platform under Musk’s ownership, while a similar share of Democrats (40 percent) said they’d be less likely to use it. Independents were split, with 25 percent saying they’d be more likely to use Twitter, versus 27 percent who reported they’d be less inclined. Meanwhile some just need more time: Sixteen percent said they’ll wait to see what changes Musk makes over the next few months before deciding their Twitter usage. </li><li>For many Americans, the decision to use Twitter may hinge around whether the platform lifts its ban on former President Donald Trump’s account, although Americans are split on the issue. Forty-two percent of Americans support allowing the former President to return to Twitter, but an equal share says the opposite, according to a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/10/31/3ea6e/1">YouGov poll</a> conducted Monday. </li><li>Forty-five percent of Americans believe that the U.S. should be a “Christian Nation,” according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/10/27/45-of-americans-say-u-s-should-be-a-christian-nation/">Pew Research Center study</a>. And while 60 percent also said that the founding fathers originally intended for the country to be a “Christian Nation,” just 33 percent of Americans said it is currently one.

<p data-paragraph="main">As recently as a few weeks ago, the Georgia Senate race seemed to be tipping toward incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock. A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">string of controversies</a> plagued the Republican candidate, Herschel Walker, and in mid-October, our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> gave Warnock a 3- to 4-percentage-point edge over his opponent. Around the same time, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a> put Warnock at an almost 6-in-10 chance of getting reelected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the dynamics of the race are different now. Sure, Walker is still dogged by allegations, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/herschel-walker-denies-new-abortion-allegation-rcna54205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which he denies</a>, that he encouraged and/or paid for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-woman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple women</a> to terminate their pregnancies, despite once campaigning on a platform that includes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/herschel-walker-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total ban on abortions</a>. (In recent weeks, Walker’s anti-abortion stance <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/14/walker-warnock-georgia-abortion-00061971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has softened somewhat</a>. He now says he agrees with a state law banning the procedure after six weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.) But Warnock’s lead over his Republican rival has slimmed to just over 1 point in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All numbers in this article are as of 5 p.m. on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> Meanwhile, national Republicans have closed ranks around Walker, despite these accusations and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous others</a> levied against him. After the first abortion allegation but before the second, Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/sens-rick-scott-tom-cotton-campaign-herschel-walker-rcna51383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traveled to the Peach State</a> to join Walker on the campaign trail. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forecast</a>, the race is considered a toss-up. Specifically, Walker now has a 55-in-100 chance of winning, and Warnock has a 45-in-100 chance of winning. And our forecast’s projection for the popular vote is razor-thin: 49.3 percent for Walker, 49.2 percent for Warnock and 1.6 percent for Libertarian candidate <a href="https://www.foxcarolina.com/2022/10/25/candidate-us-senate-l-ga-chase-oliver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chase Oliver</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So Walker wins by the narrowest of margins … right? Not so fast. As it turns out, 49.3 percent of the vote wouldn’t be enough for him to win outright. <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ga/title-21-elections/ga-code-sect-21-2-501.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia law</a> mandates that candidates must receive a majority of the vote in order to win an election; if no one does so, the top-two finishers advance to <a href="https://www.sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/2022%20State%20Scheduled%20Elections%20Short%20Calendar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a runoff election on Dec. 6</a>. Oliver’s presence on the ballot complicates things because he could, theoretically, siphon votes from both candidates and prevent Walker or Warnock from reaching the 50 percent threshold required to win on the first ballot. And with the tightening of the race, it’s looking increasingly likely that the Georgia Senate race will head to a runoff — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-won-the-georgia-runoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a>. That could give Walker or Warnock a second chance to win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what can we expect if Walker and Warnock go head-to-head in December? Well, conditions likely won’t look as rosy for Democrats as they did in January 2021, when Warnock and Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/georgia-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both narrowly defeated</a> their Republican rivals, former Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively, in their runoff races. In fact, our Deluxe forecast estimates that, if this race <em>were </em>to go to a runoff, Walker would win about 68 percent of the time.</p>

 <p>Georgia rules require a candidate to win a majority of the vote in general elections or special elections; if no candidate wins a majority, there is a runoff between the top-two finishers. If a special election took place on a regular general election date, it is included in this table. In these cases, there may be multiple candidates from each party running, so the Democratic and Republican totals are the combined vote share of all candidates from that party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That could be the case because, as the chart above shows, Georgia runoffs <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have typically favored Republicans</a>. Since the late 1960s, Georgia has seen 11 runoffs between a Democrat and a Republican for statewide office, and the runoff margin was better for Republicans than the general-election margin in seven of them. This is largely attributable to the drop-off in turnout — fewer people vote in runoff races than in general elections — and the decline usually disproportionately affects Democrats. “In runoff elections, the question is, ‘Who can get their people back to vote?’ And Republicans have historically had more success with that,” said <a href="https://spia.uga.edu/faculty-member/charles-s-bullock-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Bullock</a>, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This was no accident, either: <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anxiety/episodes/racist-history-georgia-runoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The runoff law has racist roots</a>. Voting is highly polarized by race in Georgia, which means that white voters tend to support Republican candidates and Black voters overwhelmingly support Democrats. The runoff system was created in the 1960s as a way of preserving white political power in a heavily Black state while undermining the political clout of Black lawmakers who could win more easily in a multicandidate race with a plurality of the vote, according to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tellingallamericansstories/upload/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Interior Department report</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s not what happened in the 2021 runoff. That year, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/29/new-georgia-runoffs-data-finds-that-more-black-voters-than-usual-came-out-trump-voters-stayed-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black turnout stayed high</a>, while whiter and more rural precincts saw a smaller share of voters at the polls. Warnock and Ossoff <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also improved on</a> President Biden’s margins, particularly in counties with the largest shares of Black voters. As a result, Georgia <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/warnock-georgia-first-black-senator/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected its first Black senator</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2021, though, there were a number of factors working in Democrats’ favor. Democrats worked diligently <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-democrats-may-have-found-their-own-southern-strategy-a-black-centric-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to encourage their voters</a> to turn out to the polls. The fact that the runoffs were going to decide which party controlled the Senate also generated a lot of interest in the campaign (<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/georgia-senate-runoffs-ad-spending-half-billion-dollars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least $500 million</a> worth!) and ensured that turnout would be high. Plus, then-President Donald Trump actively discouraged Republicans from trusting the state’s electoral system, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/turnout-dip-among-georgia-republicans-flipped-us-senate/IKWGEGFEEVEZ5DXTP7ZXXOROIA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which dissuaded many Republicans</a> from returning to the ballot box.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The change in 2021 can, in part, be attributed to the fact that Democrats were helped by Republicans,” Bullock said. On top of that, he added, prominent conservatives were <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-the-georgia-based-conspiracy-that-could-cost-loeffler-perdue-on-election-day/RME7ZMNFBZDYRPWS3IHG3QK7GE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discouraging GOP voters</a> from supporting both Loeffler and Perdue on the grounds that neither was reportedly doing enough to support Trump. “Some Republicans believed them, too,” Bullock said. “So it’s not so much that the two Democrats — Warnock and Ossoff — won, but that Republicans lost.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year, however, things are looking better for Republicans. For one, the party is working a lot <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/top-republicans-rally-for-herschel-walker-in-ailing-georgia-senate-bid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder at voter mobilization</a> than it did two years ago; the midterm environment favors the GOP more so than it did in 2020, too, despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/4/23387712/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-raphael-warnock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walker’s flaws as a candidate</a>. And the Peach State <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still leans red</a>, giving Republicans an additional boost.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Herschel Walker has got more skeletons than he’s got closets to hide them in. And if you’re looking for a reason to vote against Herschel, the reasons are out there,” Bullock said. “But Republican [voters] might have no problems overlooking his behavior if it means that Republicans can win control of the Senate.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, the Senate isn’t <em>all</em> we’re watching in the Peach State. While <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happened-to-stacey-abrams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ll also keep an eye</a> on the gubernatorial rematch between Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast</a> predicts that Kemp has more than a 9-in-10 chance of being reelected, so it’s unlikely this race will be as tight. In that sense, Warnock may be overperforming given the headwinds against Democrats this year. “At least maybe in a midterm year — especially one with a Democratic president and high inflation rates — you’d probably rather be a Republican running in Georgia than a Democrat,” Bullock said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, the Senate race was probably <em>always </em>going to be competitive <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-battlegrounds-georgia-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the outcome could determine</a> which party controls the upper chamber — giving voters an extra reason to turn out. We’ll find out soon how much those stakes motivate both party’s voters. And in the meantime, us election-watchers will keep our calendars open for December. If a runoff were to happen this year, early voting would start Nov. 14 — a mere week after Election Day. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Nathaniel Rakich contributed research.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CLARIFICATION (Nov. 3, 2022, 10:05 a.m.):</strong> A previous version of this story suggested that if neither Warnock nor Walker got the most votes, they would have a second chance to win. This phrasing suggested that the third-party candidate in the race would get the most votes, which is extremely unlikely. It is more a matter of whether Warnock or Walker gets a majority of the overall vote.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">With just five days until Election Day, Republicans are in good shape in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight forecast</a>. If each party were to win every race they are currently favored to win, Republicans would have 51 Senate seats and Democrats would have 49, according to our Deluxe forecast as of Wednesday at 3 p.m. Eastern.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All data in this article is as of this same date and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> And if the same thing happened in the House, Republicans would win 225 seats and Democrats would win 210.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But those gains would be modest by the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standards of midterm elections</a>. In other words, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast, this likely won’t be a “red-wave” election like 2010 (when Republicans picked up 63 House seats) or 2014 (when Republicans picked up nine Senate seats). Instead, it’s looking like more of a “red ripple.” But that doesn’t mean a red wave is impossible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our forecast emphasizes probabilities, not binary outcomes: Democrats and Republicans are only <em>slightly</em> favored to win many of those seats, and a seat with a 60-in-100 chance of going blue votes Republican 40 out of 100 times. As readers of FiveThirtyEight are undoubtedly aware, it’s not unusual for polls to be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few percentage points off the final mark</a> (this is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal</a> and just a reality of our uncertain world). Since 1998, polls of U.S. Senate elections conducted within three weeks of Election Day have had a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted-average error of 5.4 percentage points</a>, and polls of U.S. House elections have had a weighted-average error of 6.3 points.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We calculate polling error by taking the difference between the poll’s margin and the actual election-result margin. So if a poll gave the Democrat a 2-point lead, but they won by 5 points, the poll had a 3-point error. (“Weighted” means that we gave less weight to polls conducted by especially prolific pollsters, so those pollsters don’t have an outsized influence on the average.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2016 and 2020 elections, polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-werent-great-but-thats-pretty-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famously underestimated Republicans</a>. If pollsters didn’t address the factors that caused this (which are <a href="https://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/MainSiteFiles/AAPOR-Task-Force-on-2020-Pre-Election-Polling_Report-FNL_embargo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still up for debate</a>), that could happen again. On the other hand, our research has found that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-are-all-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can’t predict the direction of polling error in advance</a>. Historically, polls have been equally likely to underestimate Republicans or Democrats. So it’s also possible that pollsters have fixed the problems that plagued them in 2016 and 2020 — maybe even overcorrected for them — and that the current polls are too <em>good</em> for the GOP. In other words, a wide range of scenarios is possible in this election: everything from a Republican landslide to a world where Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/52-senators-filibuster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold the House and gain seats in the Senate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To illustrate this, let’s look at what would happen if there was a normal polling error in favor of either Republicans or Democrats. Of course, in real life, the polling error will be different in every race. But, hypothetically, let’s say that Republicans do 5.4 points better than their current FiveThirtyEight-projected vote margins in every Senate race and 6.3 points better in every House race. This roughly happened in 2020, when polls underestimated the GOP by a record amount. In this scenario, Republicans would win 54 Senate seats. Pennsylvania, Arizona and New Hampshire would fall to the GOP.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in the House, Republicans would win 259 seats in this hypothetical scenario — a 46-seat gain.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes Alaska’s at-large district, where Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola would still get the most first-place votes, but after ranked-choice voting was taken into account, she would probably lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> Democrats would lose several districts that <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/9/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2012-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for President Biden by double digits</a>, including New York’s 4th and California’s 9th, as well as several big-name incumbents, such as Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Katie Porter and Henry Cuellar. Even though no one is really talking about the possibility that Democrats will lose these seats, this list below shouldn’t be startling: Most of these districts have a less than 75-in-100 chance of going blue.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But again, we shouldn’t discount the possibility that polls will underestimate Democrats. So what would the election results look like if Democrats did 5.4 points better than the FiveThirtyEight forecast currently predicts in every Senate race and 6.3 points better in every House race? In this scenario, it would be Democrats who win 54 Senate seats — the ones in which they are currently favored plus Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And in the House, Democrats would win 227 seats, while Republicans would win 208. In other words, Democrats would <em>gain</em> seats in the lower chamber, something the president’s party has done only twice since World War II. Those gains would include light-red seats like New York’s 1st and Ohio’s 13th.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also includes Alaska’s at-large district, where we’re assuming Peltola would win in this scenario thanks to ranked-choice voting.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">To emphasize again, these are all hypothetical scenarios. If there is a pro-Republican or pro-Democratic polling error, it will almost surely unfold differently. Hopefully, though, this thought exercise has recalibrated your expectations. Of course, the polls could also be extremely accurate — as they were in the 2018 midterm. But you should be mentally prepared for something resembling the above scenarios too.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank">midterms forecast</a> continues to show Democrats and Republicans in a dead heat Senate race, with Republicans taking a very slight advantage.

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans reached a milestone on Tuesday, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing a 50 percent chance of a Senate takeover</a> in our Deluxe forecast for the first time since July 25. Still, the race for the Senate is about as close as it gets. So I thought it might be worth engaging in a dialog with my alter egos.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, you’ll meet Nathan Redd. He’ll try to convince me that the Republican outlook is even better than our model shows. Then later this week, we’ll introduce you to Nathaniel Bleu.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, he spells his last name the &lt;a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/bleu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;French way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> While fairly partisan, Redd and Bleu are canny observers of politics who are reasonably numerate. Last night, I met with Redd at a bar near Grand Central Station before his commute back to Connecticut. An abridged transcript follows:</p>


<div><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You’ve gotta be the luckiest guy I know, Silver.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Wait, what? What are you talking about? How are the kids, by the way? It’s been a while.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Luckiest guy I know. This is the easiest election call I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Well, we’re not really making “calls” at FiveThirtyEight, exactly. You know how the model works. It’s probabilistic. And the model says the Senate is about as close to 50-50 as it gets.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You think it’s 50-50? OK, let’s bet then. Steak. Sushi. Rangers tickets. You name it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> You haven’t even told me which side you want to bet on! Though I think I can guess.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> To me there are two scenarios: Republicans win big or Republicans win small.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Shocker.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> I’m telling you, this one is easy. Just look around you. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> It looks like … an Irish bar in Midtown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>It’s half-empty. And yet, the waitress hasn’t been to our table in 15 minutes. Welcome to Joe Biden’s America!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>So, you’re voting Republican because you can’t get your drink refilled?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> I mean, <em>just look</em>. It’s not back to normal. This place used to be packed from 5 p.m. ’til close. Now, they don’t even stay open past 10. Then there’s all the crime, the homelessness. There’s the inflation and the supply chain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’ll take you out to Brooklyn next time. It might as well be 2019 there. And when was the last time you closed out a bar? You moved to Connecticut when you were 23 and single.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>You’re getting off-track. The equation is pretty simple. The Democrat Party promised normal. They’re in charge of everything. We haven’t even gotten close to normal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Are we really saying “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(epithet)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrat Party”</a> now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> You’re dodging, Silver. I know the numbers. People are <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with how things are going</a>. They’re <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy with Biden</a>. Democrats barely even have a majority to begin with and there’s a backlash every midterm election.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republican-polls-affect-model-fivethirtyeight-92562557</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I get that, but it’s not so straightforward. Voters may be unhappy, but they’re <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agnostic about which party they prefer</a>. They remember former President Donald Trump, who <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t leave office as a popular guy</a>. They care about the Supreme Court, which exercises a lot of power even when Republicans are out of office. Have you talked to any of your female friends about abortion?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I don’t trust the polls anyway. C’mon. I read your stuff, believe it or not. I know your <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-polls-overestimate-democrats-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argument</a> about how it’s hard to predict polling bias. I sort of get it. But let’s do a little thought experiment. Let’s say it’s France, where they ban you from doing polling —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> You can do polls in France! Except for the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20170506-france-media-rules-prohibit-election-coverage-over-weekend-presidential-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekend before the election</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Silver, this is a thought experiment! Let’s say you’ve got no polls. What does your model say?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> Well, it’s not exactly set up to run like that. But if what you’re getting at is Republicans are pretty heavily favored on the basis of the fundamentals, then I agree. At the start of the year, I was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expecting this to be an anticlimax</a> — Republicans would win both chambers of Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>That’s exactly what I’m getting at. I’m not even saying polls will always have a Democratic bias. I’m just saying in <em>this</em> election they will, because if you look at everything <em>apart</em> from the polls, it points toward a big Republican year. And the less you trust the polls, the more you need to look at everything else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’m not even sure that’s true. Democrats are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/democratic-fundraising-skyrockets-key-senate-races-rcna51059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising as much or more money than Republicans</a>. They did <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-special-elections-really-are-signaling-a-better-than-expected-midterm-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awfully well in those special elections</a> this summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> Summer? Who cares about summer? The Trump guys I know, they don’t vote in the summer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> So now you’re back to making assertions based on imaginary friends of yours?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd:</strong> And by the way, I do talk to my female friends about abortion. Abortion is a problem for Republicans. That’s why I’m not sure if we’re going to win small or win big. But pretty much everything else lines up on our side.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I don’t see how you can be so confident about all of this.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’m not confident! I just told you, I don’t know if we’re going to win small or big. But lately I’ve been thinking big. You want to know why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver:</strong> I’m sure you’re going to tell me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>You know my favorite saying? Follow the outfielders, not the ball. When Aaron Judge hits a fly ball, look at what the left fielder is doing. Don’t listen to the crowd, they’re a bunch of idiots. Look at the professionals. The professionals are backing way up, like it’s going to be a big year for Republicans. Look where the campaigns are spending. For Democrats, it’s in blue districts. They have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/31/democrats-rush-aid-to-deep-blue-seat-in-upstate-new-york-00064258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems in New York</a>. I’m going to ask you about my boy and future New York governor Lee Zeldin in a minute, by the way. They have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/more-house-races-shift-in-gop-favor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trouble in California</a>. They’re even <a href="https://www.local10.com/vote-2022/2022/11/01/biden-headed-to-south-florida-to-campaign-1-week-before-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sending Biden to Miami-Dade County</a>!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>For a guy who’s as cynical about the media as you are, you’re awfully willing to buy into cherry-picked narratives. I don’t see how there’s any information given away by Biden visiting South Florida, for instance — it’s a swingy part of the country! And midterm elections can be regional. For every Lee Zeldin, you’ve got an Oklahoma, where the race is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oklahoma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprisingly tight in the other direction</a>. And by the way, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-had-a-superior-electoral-college-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professionals aren’t always so smart</a>. They’re just as much in the fog of war as anyone else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’m just saying, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occam’s razor</a>, Republicans win this thing. Keep it simple.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Occam’s razor? Where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=occams+razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have I heard that before</a>? But here’s the thing: I’m not actually sure that keeping it simple is better. There’s a reason we go through the trouble of building a model and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the extra work that entails</a>. I’m not sure that people’s intuitions are very good when it comes to election forecasting. In 2012, the media <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-campaign-idUKBRE8A30HP20121104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insisted that the race was a toss-up</a> because they were looking at national polls, not realizing that former President Barack Obama had a pretty big edge in the Electoral College. In 2016, they didn’t realize how fragile Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s lead was because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlated errors between the states</a>. They kept it simple and they were wrong! Sometimes the devil is in the details!</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>I’ll tell you a detail. Your <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> still has Democratic John Fetterman up in Pennsylvania’s Senate race. He’s not going to win after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/us/politics/fetterman-debate-pennsylvania-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that debate</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Ahead? I mean, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just barely</a>. And it’s still not <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-voters-are-reacting-to-fettermans-debate-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entirely clear how much the debate changed things</a>. But I agree with you in principle: if there’s news that hasn’t yet been fully reflected in the polls, that’s going to make our model a lagging indicator.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>And I tell you who <em>else </em>is going to win: my boy Lee Zeldin. People are sick of Kathy Hochul. Maybe you need to step out of your media bubble.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>Your boy? Do you actually know him? You live in Greenwich, Connecticut, not New York. Who’s living in the bubble? And he’s probably not going to win. Hochul’s still <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahead in the polls</a>. And by the way, this cuts against everything you were saying earlier about the fundamentals. Even if Republicans are having a pretty good night, we’re living in very partisan times — it’s hard to win as a Republican in New York these days.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>So, we got a bet?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>You on Zeldin, me on Hochul? Sure. Winner picks the restaurant and the wine, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>No, on the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Silver: </strong>I’m going to pass. Our model has it at 50-50, it’s been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-is-a-toss-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trending Republican</a>, and you make a couple of semi-persuasive points, like about Pennsylvania. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Redd: </strong>Semi-persuasive! That’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me, Silver! And good luck on Tuesday, but you won’t need it. It’s going to be an early night.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Two years after helping <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deliver President Biden the presidency</a>, and four years after decisively handing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control of the House of Representatives</a> to the Democratic Party, Americans living in the suburbs are poised to once again play a major role in an election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But after Democrats got the upper hand in suburban areas in 2018 and 2020, the pendulum looks set to swing back in the GOP’s direction in 2022 — at least to some extent. Most of the House races that will decide the election will take place in suburban and exurban districts: About 7 in 10 House races viewed as at least somewhat competitive — those not rated as solidly Democratic or Republican — are in predominantly suburban districts, according to in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast</a>.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the Deluxe forecast, as of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern. Forecast ratings are based on win probabilities: Solid Democratic/Republican means a party’s chance of winning is 95 percent or better; likely Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 75 and 95 percent; lean Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 60 and 75 percent; and toss-up means each party has less than a 60 percent chance of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> And Republicans, with better than a 4-in-5 shot of winning control of the House, according to the forecast, appear well-positioned to win a sufficient number of those seats to capture a majority.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To identify which seats are predominantly suburban, we categorized all 435 House districts using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>, which measures how urban or rural a district is.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight&amp;#8217;s urbanization index for congressional districts is the natural logarithm of the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract in a given district, based on a weighted average of the population of each census tract. The population of a census tract is according to 2020 census data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> To help delineate the categories, we also considered the share of the population in each district that lives in places defined as rural, exurban or small town, suburban or small city, and urban core or large city.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is based on the population of surrounding census tracts. We define rural as having fewer than 25,000 people living within a five-mile radius of a census tract; exurban or small town as having between 25,000 and 99,999; suburban or small city as having between 100,000 and 249,999 people; and urban core or large city as having 250,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> Using this information, we formulated six groupings that range from most dense to least dense: Dense Urban, Urban-Suburban, Dense Suburban, Suburban-Exurban, Rural-Exurban and Mostly Rural.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dense Urban seats have an urbanization index of 13 or higher; Urban-Suburban from 12.5 up to 13; Dense Suburban from 11.5 up to 12.5; Suburban-Exurban from 10.5 up to 11.5; Rural-Exurban from 9.5 up to 10.5; and Mostly Rural below 9.5. While we do not use their exact methodology, we owe a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-20/citylab-s-congressional-density-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;debt of inspiration to CityLab&lt;/a&gt;, which released its helpful &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-05/the-suburbs-are-the-midterm-election-battleground" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Congressional Density Index&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 2018 midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>22</sup></a></p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/republican-polls-affect-model-fivethirtyeight-92562557</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">About half the districts in the House are categorized as Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban, which we would expect given that more of the nation’s population <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/u-s-is-majority-suburban-but-doesn-t-define-suburb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lives in suburban areas</a> compared with urban or rural ones. And in line with the higher level of electoral competitiveness in suburban and exurban areas, the average seat in these categories is notably less blue or red than its more urban or rural counterparts.</p>

Dense Urban seats have an urbanization index of 13 or higher; Urban-Suburban from 12.5 to 13; Dense Suburban from 11.5 to 12.5; Suburban-Exurban from 10.5 to 11.5; Rural-Exurban from 9.5 to 10.5; and Mostly Rural below 9.5. Population data is taken from the 2020 census.</p>
 <p>The average-per-category columns reflect the average share of each district’s population that lives in census tracts defined as rural, exurban or small town, suburban or small city, or urban core or large city, which are categorized as follows: Rural has fewer than 25,000 people living within a five-mile radius of a census tract; exurban or small town as having between 25,000 and 99,999; suburban or small city as having between 100,000 and 249,999 people; and urban core or large city as having 250,000 or more.</p>
 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the last four state House elections.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">FiveThirtyEight’s forecast rates 75 districts as at least marginally competitive; of those, 53 are either Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban. (All data in this article is as of Tuesday at 5 p.m. Eastern.) As things stand, the suburban seats that are rated as lean or likely GOP would get Republicans to 211 seats when combining that with races that are rated Solid Republican, and winning most of the toss-up districts in those groupings would then put them over the top. Tellingly, of the 15 seats that have at least a 2 percent chance in our forecast of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-tipping-point-districts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being the “tipping-point” district</a> — that is, the decisive 218th seat for a party’s House majority — 12 are either Dense Suburban or Suburban-Exurban districts. Republicans are favored to some extent in nine of them, although not a lock to win any.</p>

 <p>FiveThirtyEight’s forecast ratings are based on win probabilities: Solid Democratic/Republican means a party’s chance of winning is 95 percent or better; likely Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 75 and 95 percent; lean Democratic/Republican means a party’s chances are between 60 and 75 percent; and toss-up means each party has less than a 60 percent chance of winning.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But that seat-by-seat count likely underestimates the GOP’s potential to capture suburban seats because the results in each district on Nov. 8 will not be <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/probability-independent-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent of each other</a>. That is, the swing to the right (or, less likely, the left) in a few districts <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-flip-senate-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will probably signal</a> at least some shift in the same direction elsewhere. In our forecast’s simulations, the average outcome is 230 Republican seats, seven more seats than we get when we simply assign each seat to the party with the highest win probability. That’s because if Republicans win some of the swingiest seats where Democrats currently hold a slim edge, other highly competitive seats may also swing to the right. This is a reasonably likely outcome, too, considering the GOP now has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slight lead in the generic ballot</a> that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could grow by Election Day</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s take a brief look at some of the key districts in each category. </p>



<h2><strong>Suburban-Exurban districts</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thirty-three of the 53 competitive suburban races are in districts classified as Suburban-Exurban. Overall, 11 of these seats are either toss-ups or favor the GOP to some extent. At the forefront of that group is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/iowa/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa’s 3rd District</a>, a slightly right-leaning seat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/iowa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that includes Des Moines</a>, which is the most likely tipping-point district in our forecast. Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne is defending this seat, but she appears to be a slight underdog. On the East Coast, three other light-red seats held by Democrats are also under threat. Reps. Elaine Luria and Susan Wild each have about a 50-50 chance of retaining <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/virginia/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s 2nd District</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 7th District</a>, respectively, while Rep. Tom Malinowski is trailing in his reelection race in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-jersey/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey’s 7th District</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This group also includes a couple of toss-up races along the U.S.-Mexico border in South Texas, where Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-republican-gains-in-south-texas-win-them-more-house-seats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hope to build</a> on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gains they made in the region</a> in 2020. In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas’s 34th District</a>, the incumbent-versus-incumbent contest between Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez and Republican Rep. Mayra Flores appears up in the air despite the district’s fairly strong (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on paper</a> at least) Democratic lean. There’s also a toss-up contest next door in the purple <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/texas/15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15th District</a>, although the Republican trend there might make this seat <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/24/tx15-vallejo-de-la-cruz-2022-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the GOP’s better pickup opportunities</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats do hold at least a small edge in 22 of these Suburban-Exurban seats, yet while almost all of these are being defended by Democratic incumbents, there are some juicy targets for Republicans. This group includes some light-blue seats in the northeast, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 17th District</a>, where Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/27/maloney-dems-new-york-midterms-00063645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is at risk</a> of being the first chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to lose reelection <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1584524155809996800?s=20&amp;t=79UbkR1fKrxQJVbJF2kxGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1980</a>. But it also includes a couple red-leaning Rust Belt seats, such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 8th District</a>, where Rep. Matt Cartwright is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to defy gravity</a> as northeast Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/us/politics/blue-collar-voters-pennsylvania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shifted more Republican</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Dense Suburban</strong> districts</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also 20 competitive races happening in the Dense Suburban category, including three toss-ups. Among that trio, Republicans are looking to flip two notable open seats: the bluest seat on their radar, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/rhode-island/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island’s 2nd District</a>, and swingy suburban Pittsburgh turf in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/pennsylvania/17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania’s 17th District</a>. But in the other toss-up race, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/michigan/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan’s 3rd District</a>, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-spent-loads-boosting-republicans-they-thought-were-less-electable-will-it-pay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have made it harder</a> on themselves <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/with-cheneys-loss-just-2-house-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-on-the-ballot-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by ousting</a> GOP Rep. Peter Meijer in the primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ten of those competitive seats currently advantage the GOP, including California’s blue-leaning but Republican-held <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27th District</a>, which major outside Democratic groups <a href="https://twitter.com/allymutnick/status/1583489245708423168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently decided to abandon by cutting their ad spending</a>. And as the GOP’s chances have improved in the House, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two purple seats</a> in Ohio where Republicans are favored are now the second- and seventh-most likely tipping-point seats in our forecast: In the Cincinnati-based <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1st District</a>, Republican Rep. Steve Chabot is likely to win, while Republicans look to have a similar edge in the open, Akron-based <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13th District</a> south of Cleveland.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, Democrats are favored in seven competitive seats in the Dense Suburban category, although some could still get picked off if the GOP has a good night. The open seat in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York’s 3rd District</a> may be most in danger, as the Long Island-based seat is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a light-blue seat</a>. But Democrats also need to defend <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/kansas/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas’s 3rd District</a>, a red-tinged seat in Kansas City’s suburbs, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/27/upshot/times-siena-toplines-house-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite some recent strong polling</a> for Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, neither party views the race as a done deal based on <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article267423067.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside spending</a>.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">The suburbs make up a big chunk of the districts in the House of Representatives — and the lion’s share of the districts that will be most contested on Election Day. Republicans are favored to win the House, and should they capture a majority, there’s a high likelihood that their gains in seats in the Dense Suburban and Suburban-Exurban groupings will have played a starring role in that outcome.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Sergio Piedra, 51, remembers when “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105323610/flight-tickets-inflation-pandemic-revenge-travel-vacation-europe-recession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revenge travel</a>” — or traveling to make up for lost time during the COVID-19 pandemic — was at an all-time high. But after an initial influx of out-of-towners to his home state of Florida, Piedra, who works for a local tourism marketing organization, began to notice a slight dip in visitors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is how I make a living,” he told me. “So it’s important to me that people are willing to travel.” And right now, ahead of the winter holiday season, he’s especially on edge. “It’s important to me that people are willing to travel, spend money and have a good time.” As concerns about the economy mount, however, it’s unclear whether that’ll be the case. While bookings and vacations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/travel/trends-spring-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared to increase</a> throughout the United States this past spring, <a href="https://business.fau.edu/newsroom/press-releases/2022/florida-travel-slowdown.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ve since declined</a>. It <em>does </em>look like people will be traveling for the holidays — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-save-on-holiday-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but it won’t be cheap</a>.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-concerned-inflation-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-92497861</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra, who identifies as a Democrat, understands that other Americans may be worse off — both he and his wife are still employed — but the U.S. economy is still a top concern for him. And he’s far from being alone: The latest wave of our <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos</a> poll using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a> found that “inflation or increasing costs” was top of mind for most Americans. (According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ipsos-preelection-survey-likely-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest survey data</a>, 65 percent of Americans said that issue was among the most important facing the country.) </p>

In some cases, like Piedra’s, those fears haven’t stopped them from supporting Democrats. But other voters of color I spoke with said that, despite their political affiliation, they currently trust the GOP more on issues related to the economy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was the case with James Harris, 23, who lives in California and identifies as an independent voter. In fact, Harris told me that he hopes the next Congress is gridlocked so that there’s more compromise in D.C. — something he’s optimistic will lead to more bipartisan solutions when it comes to addressing the country’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/06/7-top-economic-minds-think-global-recession-coming-some-say-its-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current economic problems</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you have Republicans in the House, Democrats in the Senate and then [President] Biden in White House, there’s going to <em>have </em>to be compromise,” he said. “While Democrats might want to pass more ambitious bills that carry a steep price tag, Republicans aren’t going to want to increase spending. And, in the end, I think that might be a healthy balance.” (The Deluxe version of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a> currently favors Republicans to win the House, while the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate is a dead heat</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Food, energy and housing costs are bipartisan concerns" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/N6fY3/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="317" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Harris and Piedra’s differing stances show, voters of color have competing views when it comes to what they’re most worried about regarding the economy <em>and </em>what they want the federal government to do about it. Despite my interviewees’ fears about the economy, though, not everyone viewed increased federal spending — such as Biden’s <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/debt-relief-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">student loan forgiveness initiative</a> or the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/biden-1point9-trillion-covid-relief-package-thursday-afternoon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 stimulus checks</a> — as a bad<em> </em>thing. “I’m for them,” said 45-year-old Beth Napper, “not because I necessarily think they help the economy as a whole, but because I think they help <em>individuals</em> who are impacted by the economy that we’re in.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><hr><span></span></div>
 



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><em>The interviews below have been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Alex Samuels: How much is the economy factoring into your voting decision in this election cycle? Is it more of a factor than it usually is or about the same? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beth Napper (45, Virginia, Black, Democrat): Economic concerns comprise at least 60 percent of my decision for voting in this year’s midterm election, which is more than usual. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sergio Piedra (51, Florida, Hispanic, Democrat): I work in the tourism industry, so I can always feel the ebb and flow of the economy. I’ve been lucky enough to maintain a job [throughout the pandemic], but I understand that many others are struggling and I sympathize with that. When I go to the voting booth, concerns about the economy will be top of mind — but they always are for me. It won’t be any greater or less this year. Statistically, how the economy is doing comprises about 50 percent in how I decide who I vote for; the other 50 percent is a bunch of other things. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">James Harris (23, California, Hispanic and white, independent): I’ve never voted before, but the economy, in my opinion, is the most important issue for my family and me this year. I know that the unemployment rate is low right now, but, because of inflation, I think that confidence in the economy is very low, too. Right now, I’m worried about gas prices and the uncertainty of how things will go. I currently work two jobs — a night job and a day job — not because I’m living paycheck to paycheck, but because expenses are going up and I want to prepare for a possible recession next year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Zachary Bimslager (43, Texas, Black and white, Libertarian): It’s hard to quantify exactly how much the economy factors into my vote this year. It’s definitely the most important factor, but I wouldn’t say that it’s more or less important than it has been in any other election. The economy is always my No. 1 issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maya Kannan (19, Texas, Asian, Republican): This is the first election that I’ll be voting in, actually, but if I were to give a percentage, I’d say that the economy comprises about 40 percent of my voting decisions this year. It’s definitely my top issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What are you most worried about regarding the economy? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’m worried about people worrying about the economy. It almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, you know: Things are bad, but it gets made worse if everyone is thinking about the worst possible outcome. I don’t mean to say that everyone needs to be as optimistic as I am, but we’ve been through so much as a country in the last few years and we’re still standing. We just need to keep moving forward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: The impact of inflation and how long it will continue to ramp up. And while this doesn’t impact me directly, the trend toward a gig economy is something I’ve seen and heard more about from my friends, and I don’t think that’s sustainable for the average person to take them through their working life and into retirement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: A lot of news outlets are predicting that we’re going to be in a recession next year, and I’m really nervous to see how things will turn out. My fear is that the people who will be most affected by a potential recession are retail workers or people who are just entering the workforce. I’m also worried about how high the unemployment rate will rise <em>if </em>we go into a recession.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: Obviously, the elephant in the room is inflation. While I’m also concerned about things like employment numbers, too, inflation is the top economic issue that I’m concerned about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have you swung back and forth in terms of the economic issues you’ve cared about most in 2022?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: The whole gas price shock threw me for a loop. At one point I was thinking, ‘Man, how high can these prices go?’ But I think I’ve reeled back from that as things have stabilized — relatively speaking — into the summer and fall. I don’t want to sound self-serving, but as we enter the holiday season, I’ve been thinking more about the impact the economy has on the tourism industry and whether people are going to get back to leisure traveling. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: No, I don’t think so. I feel like the same issues have been prevalent throughout all of 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Yes, certainly. At the beginning of the year, unemployment was my top concern. I saw a number of people lose jobs and that started to scare me. Later on, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising gas prices became my biggest worry. Then, once inflation got out of hand, that became a bigger deal to me over energy prices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Have your own personal finances — or your general financial situation — changed in the last few years?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: Not really, no. It has been steady. I’ve been through worse situations. For example, during the Great Recession, I didn’t get a pay raise for five years. But my wife and I have continued to work, receive pay increases and pay our bills — so that has been good.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Before I moved to San Francisco, I was living in Indianapolis, where I went to school and graduated May 2022. While I was there, though, I didn’t own a car and would borrow my friend’s. Whenever I had to fill up the gas tank, it would be about $30, but, month by month, that increased and eventually it got closer to $50. I started noticing how much more I was paying in gas starting in summer 2021 compared to years prior. And throughout the year until now, it has gotten worse. Those small expenses that you have to do on a daily or weekly basis — like buying groceries or getting gas — add up, and it puts me in a hard position because I’ve had to sacrifice some of my wants to pay for these things.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: No. I’ve been employed by the same company for a very long time, so our salaries haven’t really been affected by issues with the economy. As a consumer, my buying power is down with the current inflation rates, but it hasn’t been <em>too</em> drastic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Who do you think is responsible for your current financial situation?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: Myself. There’s a lot of factors that I can’t control — whether it’s the government or how many people are traveling at any given time — but, at the end of the day, you still have to work and make the right decisions economically. So, in a sense, I feel like I’m the one most responsible for what happens to me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: In all honesty, part of it is on me. I know that I need to budget better and probably not do things like buy coffee in the morning or order Ubers. But I think the primary reason why the economy is in the position that it’s in is due to supply shortages all around the world. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: Ultimately, I am, but in a political context, I’d say that both parties are responsible. At any given point in time, I’d blame the political party in power, but I do think that both Democrats and Republicans make the same mistakes regarding the economy — particularly when it comes to federal spending. This is a systemic issue, though, so I wouldn’t necessarily blame neither Biden nor [former President Donald] Trump for where we are today. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: I think that a lot rests on the previous president. While there was a lot of economic growth under the Trump administration, the beginning of certain spending expenditures that ultimately led to the economic issues we have now started with him. I also think you could argue that Trump wasn’t tough enough on Russia, and, if he were, that may have prevented some of the issues we’re facing now. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you more concerned about your own financial situation or the country’s?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: The country’s. But what I’m really worried about is the middle class. What I’ve observed and heard in conversations with friends, families and the various communities I’m a part of is a concern for whether our country’s current economic situation is sustainable; and if it’s not, I’m worried about what the ripple effects of that will be. Will that mean higher taxes? More inflation? Those are all major concerns of mine.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: The country’s. I have a budget and try to follow it as closely as I can, but I am really worried about the country’s economy because if it isn’t in good shape, then unemployment will eventually go up. I’m also worried about job security — not just for my own sake, but for other Americans and my family members, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Definitely the country’s. Thankfully, my father is very established in his career and I’m pursuing a degree that has promising job prospects, so I’m not overly concerned about my own finances. That said, there’s definitely reason to suspect that many people in the U.S. are going to suffer from this period we’re in now. Inflation affects things like tuition, but a lot of jobs still require a college degree. And if more people forego a college education as a result, that could impact their future income. Certainly, the situation we’re in now is going to have long-term, negative effects for a very large swath of people in the country. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Do you think recent federal spending initiatives have contributed to rising inflation? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I think so, but I also believe these things needed to be done for the good of the country. For every action, there’s going to be a reaction. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: Yes, but I support most of those initiatives. And while they’ve contributed to inflation, they’re by no means, at least in my mind, the root cause of what we’re seeing today. I think that the economic situation we’re in now has been in the works for some time. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Absolutely. While I supported initiatives like the American Rescue Plan, I think the federal government also overspent during that time. And I’ve seen a lot of articles about PPP money getting stolen, so I wish that we would’ve spent less during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: To a certain degree, but I wouldn’t blame them for everything we’re seeing now. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the country’s economic downturn, too. Of course, a certain amount of inflation is inevitable, and I think some federal spending initiatives — from both the Biden and Trump administrations — were wasteful, but I wouldn’t necessarily blame only the most <em>recent</em> ones for everything we’re seeing now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Are you for or against recent Biden administration proposals and policies that have or will affect the economy — such as the COVID-19 stimulus checks or forgiving some student loan debt?</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’m mostly for the things that [Biden] is doing. I may not agree with everything, but you have to give the man a shot at trying. The idea is to come up with something different from the previous administrations, and I want to see how that plays out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: I didn’t receive any stimulus money because, at the time, I was still dependent on my parents. While I think a lot of people needed the money, and I supported giving COVID-19 stimulus checks to individuals, I believe that the way it was rolled out was ineffective because there was a lot of fraud. And, to be honest, I don’t support Biden’s student loan debt initiative because the cost of universities is still going to go up, and, 10 years from now, we’re still going to have people in debt. Even though a lot of people will be helped by loan forgiveness, [the initiative] still doesn’t address the underlying issue of why college tuition is increasing and how we can bring a stop to that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: I’m not necessarily in favor of them primarily because I don’t think that a lot of these spending initiatives will lead to [Biden’s] desired outcome. For example, I don’t think that the Inflation Reduction Act will do much to curb inflation. That said, I’m not up in arms about these policies, either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: Conceptually, I agreed with the stimulus checks. My family received them, but I don’t think we necessarily needed them — so some of the spending there might have been excessive. I also question whether the stimulus checks discouraged people from seeking employment during the labor shortage. And while I understand the sentiment behind the student loan initiative, I wonder if now was the best time to deploy that. It also doesn’t really solve the problem of unaffordable higher education. It’s a policy to win votes, but it doesn’t solve the underlying issues at hand. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: What, if anything, do you hope the federal government will do to alleviate your concerns regarding the economy?  </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: I would like to see more bipartisan support for measures that really deal with what I think are the root causes of our current economic situation. In an ideal world, I would like to see our representatives fight for what’s right for individuals versus corporations. I think that a lot of people equate the strength of our economy to the strength of corporations and, as far as I can tell, our corporations are as strong — or stronger — than they’ve ever been. That’s happening, though, at the detriment of the individual. So I want more policies that focus on helping people. I can’t name anything specific that I’d like to see, but I want more of a shift in the mindset of our politicians. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bimslager: They just need to stop spending so much money in general. But I’d have that critique of any administration, regardless of party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: There needs to be more accountability and transparency about how federal money is being spent. It is important to get an explanation of how specific spending initiatives in the budget accomplish the government’s goals — say, improved welfare, greater security, economic growth, et cetera. I’m not saying that we need to spend less necessarily, but we need to know what’s supposed to happen with that money. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>AS: Which party do you trust more on economic issues? Why? </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Piedra: I’ll be loyal and say that I trust my party, the Democrats. I think with Democrats, there’s a degree of realism, but with Republicans, they just want to repeat the same tactic over and over again: Cut taxes here and allegedly cut spending there — and they never really do either well. Their economic messaging has become really tiresome to me.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Napper: At the moment, I don’t trust either party because I feel that everyone is more concerned with being reelected than the work that we elect them to do while they’re there. I hope that there are individuals who are not that way, but, on the whole, that’s how I view both parties.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harris: Honestly, neither of them. But if I had to choose right now, I’d say that I trust the Republicans more. Republicans want to bring taxes down, which I support. We also need to focus on bringing federal spending down, and I think that the Republicans are more cognizant about that. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kannan: If you asked me this a few years ago, I would have said the Republican Party easily. But at the moment, the Democrats have a slight edge. That’s not to say that I fully trust them, but I think Republicans, unfortunately, given the current leadership, are not very good at determining which battles are worth fighting. When I was younger and first started identifying as Republican, politicians like Mitt Romney were quite content with globalization as a way of improving the standard of living. Trump, meanwhile, was ready to sacrifice standard of living just to counter globalization, which, to me, is not sound economic policy. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Sunday, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/overturning-roe-has-meant-at-least-10000-fewer-legal-abortions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight published data</a> showing that there were at least 10,000 fewer legal abortions in July and August than before the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Those numbers — from #WeCount, a research project funded by the nonprofit Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights — provided a detailed, if incomplete, picture of how abortion has changed in the United States since the Dobbs decision in June. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One key question was left unanswered, though: How many of the people unable to get a legal abortion got one another way? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2797883" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new research paper released today</a> begins to answer that question. It shows that Aid Access, <a href="https://www.vox.com/23056530/aid-access-abortion-roe-wade-pills-mifepristone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an international abortion pill service</a> that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/15/health/fda-aid-access-abortion-pill-warning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distributes medication abortion</a> in places where it’s illegal, received a combined total of 6,533 more requests for pills from the United States in July and August 2022, with each month compared to an April 2022 baseline.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data compiled in the paper is limited to the 30 states in which Aid Access does not currently provide telemedecine abortion within a formal health care setting. It also excludes requests made to Aid Access for abortion pills that patients who said they were not yet pregnant requested in order to keep pills on hand, just in case. We calculated the difference between the number of requests made in July vs. April and in August vs. April to match the calculations we had made in our previous reporting on the #WeCount data. We did not use data from May or June, as the Supreme Court’s leaked opinion in May and final opinion in June could have caused noise we could not control for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667321522000373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous analysis of Aid Access data suggests</a> that about 50 to 60 percent of requests result in completed abortions, which would mean at least an additional 3,267 abortions in July and August combined, compared to that April baseline. While this estimate is inexact, the increase demonstrates the role that self-managed abortion now plays in shaping abortion access in America.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every time we’ve seen policy restricting abortion, we’ve seen increases in demand to Aid Access,” said Dr. Abigail Aiken, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the co-authors on the study. “The evidence that we’ve seen shows us that when you ban or severely restrict abortion, you don’t do anything to change the need for abortion. But what you seem to do is change how and where people access care.” </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/voters-decide-future-abortion-rights-michigan-fivethirtyeight-92494272</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Aid Access, the abortion provider at the heart of the study, was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-rebecca-gomperts-helps-americans-abortions-reports-4000-inquiries-since-roe-overturned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded in 2018 by Dutch activist Dr. Rebecca Gomperts</a>, who is also a co-author on the paper. Aid Access occupies a kind of legal gray area — in 2019, the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/aidaccessorg-575658-03082019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to stop the organization</a> from shipping pills into the U.S., saying that Aid Access was violating federal law by distributing misbranded and unapproved drugs, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758871490/european-doctor-who-prescribes-abortion-pills-to-u-s-women-online-sues-fda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but it was unsuccessful</a>, and Gomperts has repeatedly said her organization follows the law. It’s a crime to self-manage an abortion in <a href="https://www.ifwhenhow.org/abortion-criminalization-new-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three states</a> — Oklahoma, South Carolina and Nevada — and it’s against the law to prescribe abortion pills remotely <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 19 states</a>. It’s also <a href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation#refusals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal in many cases</a> for Americans to import drugs from overseas for personal use. But these laws are difficult to enforce and individuals are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/pharma-and-life-sciences/as-abortion-access-shrinks-people-turn-to-imported-pills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely prosecuted</a>, essentially creating a legal loophole for groups like Aid Access and the people who use their services. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because it has been offering its services to clients in the United States for several years, Aid Access has data that covers multiple phases in American abortion policy. The organization requires clients to fill out a form detailing their medical history and reason for requesting abortion pills, which is reviewed by a medical provider. If there are no medical red flags in that self-reported data, the organization sends the requester pills. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the constitutional right to abortion was overturned in June, Aid Access’s online request form blew up. According to the new paper, the number of weekly requests for abortion pills from Aid Access rose in a number of states, with the highest increases coming from people in states with full bans on abortion. For example, requests rose the most in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma — all of which had implemented near-total bans on abortion by early July.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_f0398ef4-045f-11ed-896d-db553e7f3549.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louisiana banned abortion&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the Dobbs ruling, but a series of court rulings meant that abortion was intermittently available through the month of July. Abortion has been fully and consistently illegal in Louisiana &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/10/1116802767/louisianas-abortion-ban-has-doctors-worried-about-patients-and-their-own-careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;since early August&lt;/a&gt;. Requests were measured per 100,000 female residents of reproductive age (15 to 44).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In these states, some people may see an organization like Aid Access as their only option. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798215?guestAccessKey=70c1bc40-5cc0-4bcf-a73d-a5b9b26ccf01&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=110122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another paper published today</a> by Ushma Upadhyay, a professor and public health social scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, found that in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling, an estimated one-third of reproductive-age women in the U.S. live in a census tract more than an hour from an abortion facility.<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding Hawaii and Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> For people living in Texas, estimated travel time to an abortion clinic rose by almost eight hours.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The availability of abortion pills — which, if taken during early pregnancy, result in <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-availability-and-use-of-medication-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a process very similar to an early miscarriage</a> — has transformed the way abortion happens in the U.S.. Medication abortion was already growing in popularity, even before abortion rights appeared to be seriously threatened. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study</a> published by the Guttmacher Institute earlier this year estimated that medication abortion accounted for more than half (54 percent) of abortions in 2020, up from 39 percent in 2017. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The vast majority</a> of U.S. abortions happen in the first trimester, which means abortion pills — which the FDA has approved for use <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the 10th week</a> of pregnancy — are an option for many patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a change in the way abortion pills are regulated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/health/abortion-pills-fda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed them to be prescribed legally</a> through telehealth in some states. Since then, several online-only abortion services have popped up. These companies operate legally in the U.S. and can only mail pills to states where abortion is legal. They also offer virtual medical supervision in case of complications.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Medication abortion isn’t just used for legal abortions, though — it’s also a safe, hard-to-detect way to terminate a pregnancy outside the medical and legal system. In the era before Roe v. Wade, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-history-of-back-alley-abortions-can-teach-us-about-a-future-without-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various methods of self-induced abortion</a> often resulted in infection or other serious health problems. Now, though, it’s relatively easy for people to order abortion pills over the internet from services like Aid Access. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Medication abortion is effective and low-risk — even when it’s used outside the clinical setting. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2790319#:~:text=Conclusions%20and%20Relevance%20In%20this,involving%20ultrasonography%20or%20pelvic%20examination." target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study published earlier this year</a> of nearly 4,000 women who received abortion pills without an in-person visit found that 95 percent of the abortions were completed without the need for further medical intervention, and less than 1 percent resulted in serious complications. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-can-expect-if-abortion-pills-become-their-only-safe-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it can also be intensely painful for some</a>, and there’s no real way to know in advance what kind of experience any one person will have. Aiken said that <a href="https://www.mahotline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotline services</a> for self-managed miscarriage and abortion can help people deal with that variability at home, but also said it was significant that the use of medication abortion and extralegal providers like Aid Access is increasing even in states where abortion remains legal. “There were a substantial portion of folks saying, ‘I’m making this request because I prefer the comfort and privacy of my own home,’” she said. “They have a choice, they could go to a clinic, they could do something else, but they’re actually choosing to self manage.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, pill providers like Aid Access represent a safe way of self-managing abortion — something that did not exist in the pre-Roe era. “So as long as the bans remain in place, I think we’re going to see those numbers remain stable, if not increase,” Aiken said.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Nov. 3, 2022, 10:15 a.m.):</strong> This story has been updated to include Leon Benjamin Jr. and Dan Cox, after FiveThirtyEight confirmed both candidates said they attended the Jan. 6 rally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After then-President Donald Trump’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, some of his supporters left his rally and smashed their way into the U.S. Capitol building, and now <a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly a thousand of them are facing charges</a>. But some in the crowd that day have gone on to try to enter the Capitol the old-fashioned way: by running for Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are at least 11 GOP candidates running for Senate, House and governor seats this fall who were in attendance at the Jan. 6 rally, according to FiveThirtyEight’s database. Their attendance indicates an extreme acceptance of Trump’s inaccurate claims of a stolen election. Of those 11, just one is running in a race that is either likely or solidly Republican, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast</a>. Here’s a closer look at each of those 11 candidates, including what we know about their activities that day and how likely they are to win their election, as of Monday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All data in this article is as of this date and time.)</p>

<h2><strong>Leon Benjamin Sr.: Virginia’s 4th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Benjamin, a pastor and military veteran, attended Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 and joined crowds outside of the Capitol, according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LeonBenjaminVA4/posts/232560558273020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photos</a> he posted to social media the next day. Benjamin challenged Democratic incumbent Rep. Donald McEachin for this seat in 2020 but lost <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:2020/year_to:2020/office_id:5/district_id:27257/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by 23 percentage points</a>. He was <a href="https://www.progress-index.com/story/news/2020/06/28/richmond-pastor-picked-to-be-4th-district-gop-candidate/112169704/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named the Republican candidate</a> once again during a nominating convention in June but will likely face a similar outcome next week. Our forecast gives Benjamin <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/virginia/4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100</a> chance of winning. </p>



<h2><strong>Dan Cox: Maryland governor</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cox, a Republican representative in the Maryland House of Delegates, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko_0iA6wkEM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 rally with seven of his children</a>, though he says he did not participate in the attack on the Capitol. However, during the riot, he did <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/01/08/after-traitor-tweet-cox-denounces-mob-violence-at-u-s-capitol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet that former Vice President Mike Pence was a traitor</a>. Our forecast gives Cox <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100 chance</a> of winning Maryland’s gubernatorial race.</p>



<h2><strong>Tina Forte: New York’s 14th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this district that covers much of the Bronx and Queens in New York City, Forte is challenging Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You probably don’t need to check the forecast to figure out what kind of odds Forte has. She is a right-wing influencer and Newsmax contributor who gained a following from selling Trump merchandise and spreading QAnon conspiracy theories. She has repeated Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and livestreamed her participation in the Jan. 6 rally, telling followers to get their “<a href="https://twitter.com/snopes/status/1430954398998351875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asses to the Capitol</a>.” Forte later said she didn’t regret attending Jan. 6 even after the violence that broke out, <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/2022-elections/2022/09/29/tina-forte--aoc-s-opponent--is-a-jan--6-attendee-with-ties-to-extremists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling NY1</a>, “I went there to shine light on the election. I did nothing. I didn’t participate in anything that went on that day, from what I see on videos or anything that they want to call it.” Forte has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100</a> chance of winning, according to our forecast.</p>

<h2><strong>Elizabeth Joy: New York’s 20th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Joy attended the Jan. 6 rally outside of the Capitol and posted photos on social media on the day, but she said she was “football fields” away from the violent attack. <a href="https://dailygazette.com/2021/01/08/joy-extremists-detracted-from-concerns-about-election-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She condemned the violence</a> and said those who broke into the Capitol were “extremists.” The race for this district based around Albany is a rerun: Joy challenged incumbent Democratic Rep. Paul Tonko in 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-york-house-district-20.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and lost by 22 points</a>, a result she may face yet again: Our forecast gives her <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2-in-100 chance</a> of winning.</p>



<h2><strong>J.R. Majewski: Ohio’s 9th District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Majewski is an Air Force veteran <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/10/ohio-man-paints-entire-yard-as-trump-banner/42085319/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who once made headlines</a> for painting almost his entire front lawn into a Trump sign. Majewski attended the Jan. 6 march in D.C. and <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/3936186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed to have funded</a> travel for other attendees, though he says he “<a href="https://twitter.com/JRMajewski/status/1535129741241597952?s=20&amp;t=4gBxHKdjTZ7fFdTzp1Fe0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed no crimes</a>” and “broke no police barriers.” He’s hoping to unseat Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/WIC/Historical-Data/Women-Who-Have-Served-More-Than-25-Years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House’s longest-serving woman</a>. And there’s a chance he might. During redistricting, the Republican-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redrew Kaptur’s district</a>, transforming it from a Democratic stronghold into a slightly Republican-leaning district. That said, Majewski has lost some momentum after the Associated Press reported <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-afghanistan-ohio-campaigns-e75d2566635f11f49332bd1c46711999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he had misrepresented</a> parts of his military service record, prompting the National Republican Congressional Committee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/22/house-gop-cuts-loose-candidate-who-misled-about-military-service-00058406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to kill a nearly $1 million ad buy</a> it had planned for the race. FiveThirtyEight’s forecast gives Majewski <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/ohio/9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 23-in-100 chance</a> of winning the race.</p>



<h2><strong>Doug Mastriano: Pennsylvania governor</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mastriano, the Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/doug-mastriano-election-lies-disinformation-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was actively involved in the “Stop the Steal” movement</a> — protests pushing the false belief that the 2020 election was stolen. He hosted a policy meeting with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in November 2020 to discuss voter-fraud conspiracy theories, and he helped fund travel for participants to attend the Jan. 6 protest in D.C. So it’s not surprising that he joined fellow election deniers in the rally that day, though he says he did not cross any police barriers or enter the building. The House Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack subpoenaed Mastriano, who then refused to testify and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/01/mastriano-lawsuit-jan6-committee-00054554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the committee</a>. In the race for Pennsylvania governor, Mastriano has been struggling to keep up with the Democratic nominee, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Mastriano has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 5-in-100 chance</a> of becoming the new governor of the Keystone State, according to our forecast. </p>



<h2><strong>Jo Rae Perkins: U.S. Senate, Oregon</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that Perkins attended the Jan. 6 rally is probably not shocking if you’re familiar with the perennial candidate. Perkins, who was <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/ex-senate-candidate-jo-rae-perkins-among-trump-supporters-in-dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the Capitol on Jan. 6 but says she did not enter</a> the building, unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020. After winning the Republican Senate primary in 2020, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jo-rae-perkins-oregon-republican-senate-primary-winner-thanks-qanon-for-victory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she thanked followers of QAnon</a> — the false conspiracy theory that there is a secret cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles made up of Democratic elites and Hollywood celebrities. Less than a week after losing that race to incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, she announced <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/oregon/election-results-spur-conspiracies-and-unrest-in-oregons-capitol/article_7d4c06c0-2175-11eb-aecc-d3a4d9902641.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a “Stop the Steal” rally</a> her intent to run for U.S. Senate again, this time challenging longtime Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden. Perkins is likely in for yet another disappointment: Our forecast gives her <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100 shot</a> of winning. </p>



<h2><strong>George Santos: New York’s 3rd District </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Santos, a Wall Street investor, is the Republican nominee for an open seat representing this district, which spans a northwest part of Long Island. Santos <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/watch-the-right-view-with-lara-trump-bernie-kerik/id1545052064?i=1000509886205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said he was “at the Ellipse on Jan. 6”</a> and called the crowd (some of whom went on to break into the Capitol building) “amazing,” but he has more recently called the riot “<a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/zimmerman-santos-congress-new-york-ly28so9a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dark day in America</a>” and refused to provide details about where he was during the attack. Our forecast gives Santos <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/new-york/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 26-in-100 chance</a> of winning against his Democratic opponent, former congressional aide Robert Zimmerman.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A business executive and entrepreneur, Smith previously ran to represent this district in 2020, challenging longtime Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield. She lost by 9 percentage points then, but she is back this year hoping to replace the retiring Butterfield. Smith attended the Jan. 6 rally, <a href="https://twitter.com/SandySmithNC/status/1347016673115709440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeting a video amidst the crowd</a> and saying she believed Trump won the election (he did not). But even without facing an incumbent, Smith has an uphill battle in this blue-leaning district. Our forecast gives her just <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/north-carolina/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 4-in-100 chance</a> of winning against the Democratic candidate, state Sen. Don Davis. </p>



<h2><strong>Derrick Van Orden: Wisconsin’s 3rd District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Van Orden is a retired Navy SEAL who ran for Congress in this expansive district in 2020, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-wisconsin-house-district-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing by just 3 points</a> to incumbent Democratic Rep. Ron Kind. On Jan. 6, Van Orden was in D.C. “for meetings and to stand for the integrity of our electoral system as a citizen and at the behest of my neighbors here in Western Wisconsin,” <a href="https://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/derrick-van-orden-we-need-abraham-lincoln-now-more-than-ever/article_f29c4153-a584-54df-9d07-b6092ab38d57.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to an op-ed he wrote after</a> the riot. Van Orden said he stood at the perimeter and watched the attack begin. He wrote that he left when “it became clear that a protest had become a mob,” and said he was “disturbed” by the ensuing attack. Now, with Kind retiring, Van Orden is taking another run at the seat and is leading the Democratic candidate, state Sen. Brad Pfaff. Our forecast gives Van Orden <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/wisconsin/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 85-in-100 chance</a> of winning. </p>



<h2><strong>Jeff Zink: Arizona’s 3rd District</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Jan. 6, Zink and his son participated in the protest outside of the Capitol, though the elder Zink says <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona-republic/2021/01/08/stories-arizonans-who-were-u-s-capitol-day-breached/6604727002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he only stood on the steps outside of the Capitol</a> and did not go inside. His son <a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2021/02/05/ttu-student-son-az-congressional-candidate-accused-participation-capitol-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was later arrested and charged</a> with trespassing, assault and damaging property (he has <a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/new-developments-in-case-against-lubbock-man-charged-for-january-6-capital-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded not guilty</a>). Zink condemned the violence of the riot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feQEG08O0H4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but also spoke out in defense of individuals arrested</a> for alleged involvement in the attack. Zink is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and has an uphill battle in this deep-blue district, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+44</a>. Our forecast gives Zink <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/arizona/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a less than 1-in-100</a> chance of unseating Gallego.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is only a sample — there are even more candidates running <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/29/metro/right-wing-agitator-who-attended-jan-6-riot-is-running-mass-house-testing-state-gops-appetite-extremism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for state</a> and <a href="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article248787235.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local offices</a> who also attended the Jan. 6 rally, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/28/january-6-candidate-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some who have faced charges</a> for their alleged participation in the riots that followed. There’s also Max Miller, the Republican candidate for Ohio’s 7th District, who helped plan the rally as a member of Trump’s White House, though it’s unclear if he was physically there that day. (Our forecast gives Miller a 98-in-100 chance of winning.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stay tuned for our coverage of the races featuring Jan. 6 attendees — in addition to all candidates who have denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election — in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Four years ago, Stacey Abrams had the world at her feet. Yes, she had just lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race to Gov. Brian Kemp by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/us/politics/abrams-kemp-2018-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer than 60,000 votes</a> — but after such an unexpectedly tight contest, she was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/5/18211154/stacey-abrams-state-of-union-2019-response-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heralded by the Democratic Party</a> as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/on-politics-stacey-abrams-sotu-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a promising new leader</a>. There was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/14/biden-running-mate-stacey-abrams-underdog-push-for-vp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation about whether she’d be chosen</a> as Joe Biden’s running mate during his 2020 bid for the presidency (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/us/politics/stacey-abrams-vice-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a prospect Abrams welcomed</a>), and she was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-democrats-may-have-found-their-own-southern-strategy-a-black-centric-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely credited</a> for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pioneering a new playbook</a> focused on turning out Black voters in Georgia, especially after Biden flipped the state in 2020. Though Biden eventually tapped then-Sen. Kamala Harris of California to share the ticket, Abrams kept her eyes on the governor’s mansion. But she enters this year’s race as even more of an underdog <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-democrat-aims-to-be-nations-first-female-african-american-governor/2017/06/03/7c5a7c2a-4833-11e7-a196-a1bb629f64cb_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than she was in 2018</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most recent surveys of the race consistently show Abrams, a former minority leader in Georgia’s state House, trailing Kemp by single digits, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a> as of this past Friday at 12 p.m. Eastern. (All data in this article is as of this date and time.) An October poll from <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/10/dfp_ga_midterm_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data for Progress</a>, though, found that the Republican held a lead of 10 percentage points over Abrams — 3 points more than when <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/9/dfp_ga_midterm_toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the firm last polled the race</a>, in September. And while Abrams had stronger support among Democrats than Kemp did with Republicans, according to a September <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_ga_092222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a> survey, the pollsters also concluded that Abrams’s path to victory this year was “much narrower.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abrams’s campaign is also <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/09/29/two-dem-stars-struggle-to-recapture-the-magic-00059662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracting a lot less buzz</a> this year compared with the frenetic excitement of her candidacy in 2018. That stands out because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-senate-race-is-much-closer-than-the-governor-election-will-that-hold-until-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there’s a significant gap</a> between Abrams’s polling against Kemp versus that of Sen. Raphael Warnock, another Democrat on the ballot, who is running for reelection against Republican Herschel Walker. According to our database, no recent nonpartisan polls give Walker a lead. Most nonpartisan surveys, especially those fielded following <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/herschel-walker-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walker’s abortion controversy</a>, have given Warnock a single-digit edge. In fact, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average</a> is almost 2 points in Warnock’s favor. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast</a> of the election, meanwhile, has assessed the race as a toss-up.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the governor’s race, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Deluxe forecast gives</a> Kemp about a 9-in-10 chance of being reelected, as of this past Friday at 12 p.m. Eastern. Because Abrams is a Black woman seeking statewide office in the South, <a href="https://www.insider.com/georgia-midterm-elections-black-women-politics-diversity-sexism-racism-bias-2022-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexism and racism</a> are likely to blame for some of her underperformance — but not all of it. Abrams’s lackluster polling can also be attributed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/black-men-are-showing-tepid-enthusiasm-for-stacey-abrams-in-georgia-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the tepid enthusiasm</a> for her candidacy among Black men. Plus, unlike in 2018, when she was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/georgia-gubernatorial-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running for an open seat</a>, she’s now up against <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-stacey-abrams-biden-georgia-a46b3c9fc7192682fea51078dc4a490c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an incumbent</a> who <a href="https://time.com/6220287/brian-kemp-georgia-governor-race-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has proven himself</a> to be a <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/gov-kemp-economic-development-georgia/85-cb733793-d4ce-432e-a0b9-a7eb7c8be556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deft politician while in office</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Incumbency still matters,” said <a href="https://spia.uga.edu/faculty-member/gbemende-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gbemende Johnson</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. “On top of that, Kemp now has a record that he can run on, so the conditions are quite different for Abrams than they were in 2018.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, a loss for Abrams this year could be less about her shortcomings as a candidate and more about a number of baked-in advantages playing to Kemp’s favor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one, Kemp’s <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relative popularity as governor</a> is a boon to his candidacy. Plus, in his race against Abrams, he’s <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2022-08-10/gov-kemp-georgia-shatters-investment-and-job-records-fy22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played into issues important to Georgians</a> — like the economy and inflation — as a political point to keep him in office. Abrams, meanwhile, has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-stacey-abrams-voting-georgia-atlanta-f3051f5da33a65d6a0b34883be918ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking a lot about abortion</a> — and even though a six-week ban on abortion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/us/georgia-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went into effect in July</a>, that issue appears to be less salient for Georgia voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s also working in Kemp’s favor is that the political environment in 2022 is <em>much</em> different than it was four years ago, when Republicans controlled the White House. Back then, Democrats could largely run on <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a> with Donald Trump and work to tie their challengers <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/brian-kemp-enlists-donald-trump-in-the-effort-to-build-a-big-red-beautiful-wall-around-georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the former president</a>. But Trump isn’t in the White House this year. And in the time since 2018, Kemp has lost favor with the former president after he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/12/brian-kemp-trump-election-georgia-00061347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resisted pressure to overturn the results</a> of the 2020 election. He also had to beat back <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1100739768/georgia-trump-kemp-perdue-abrams-primary-election-lies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Trump-backed primary challenger</a>, former Sen. David Perdue, in May. In doing so, Kemp may have broken slightly with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mainstream of the GOP</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not hard for someone to position themselves to the left of Trump, particularly when ‘to the left’ simply means that you won’t overturn an election,” said <a href="https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/periloux-peay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Periloux Peay</a>, a professor of political science at Georgia State University. “That does not mean that [Kemp] is, by any means, a moderate or even someone who leans conservative. He’s a staunch Republican.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if his policies are very conservative, Johnson said, Kemp’s show of independence from Trump could still help him. “You could imagine, for example, that there are voters on the more moderate side who may have slight preferences for Democratic policies but still want to give Kemp credit for his performance or the performance of the economy in Georgia,” she said. “You might say, ‘He’s not necessarily my cup of tea, but at least he was not willing to interfere in an election in the way the previous president wanted him to.’” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-black-americans-reshaped-politics-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we’ve reported previously</a>, Georgia’s electorate is ideologically calcified by race and geography. In short, that means it’s likely that Abrams will win an overwhelming majority of Black voters, while Kemp will likely perform better with rural, white voters. That dynamic exists primarily because the demographics of the Peach State have changed drastically in the past two decades, thanks to an inflow of new Black residents. So whether this contest is close may come down to how many Black voting-age Georgians cast their ballots. What’s working against Abrams, however, is that she’s reportedly struggling to make inroads with Black men, who might be <a href="https://www.wabe.org/stacey-abrams-looks-to-win-black-men-in-bid-for-georgia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving slightly toward Republicans</a>. Abrams, for her part, has tried to account for that by hosting conversations called “Stacey and the Fellas” to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfowler/2022/09/12/stacy-abrams-talks-georgia--gubernatorial-race-and-expanding-the-electorate-days-before-the-midterms/?sh=52bd6f964076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engage Black men</a> in the state. But it’s not clear whether her efforts are paying off: <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/10/dfp_ga_midterm_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At least one survey</a> showed Kemp netting 15 percent of the Black vote.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/candidates-sitting-debates-voters-care-fivethirtyeight-92297212</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">It could also be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/us/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder for Abrams</a> — compared with Warnock — to appeal to independent or moderate Republican voters who are disillusioned with the GOP but don’t want to support a progressive candidate. That’s because not only does she not have a statewide record to run on, but also there are longstanding stereotypes about female <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/10/19/black-candidates-are-perceived-as-more-liberal-than-similar-white-candidates-and-this-may-be-hurting-them-at-the-ballot-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black politicians</a> being <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912908322416?journalCode=prqb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived as progressive</a>, even if that’s not necessarily the case. Plus, conservatives have spent the last four years painting Abrams <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/trump-calls-georgia-gop-gov-candidate-kemp-extraordinary-amid-vote-n931076" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a far-left bogey(wo)man</a>. At times, too, Abrams has seemingly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/abrams-warnock-pursue-different-strategies-key-georgia-races-rcna52544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled to find her place</a> within the Democratic Party. While she’s taken more progressive stances as of late <a href="https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1581622067891343360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on issues like reparations</a> to Black Americans as a restitution for slavery, her record as a state legislator was<em> </em>marked by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/us/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan negotiation</a>.<strong> </strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other issues facing Abrams this year are largely out of her control. The state’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-georgias-new-voting-law-is-such-a-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictive new voting law</a> could dampen turnout among voters of color, and Biden <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/13/bidens-net-approval-rating-is-underwater-in-45-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could also be a drag</a> on both Abrams’s and Warnock’s candidacies since his approval ratings in the state are well below both Democrats’ numbers, according to an October <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinnipiac University</a> survey. Per the poll, just 44 percent of likely voters in the state approved of Biden’s job performance, while 51 percent approved of Warnock’s performance and 48 percent had a favorable opinion of Abrams.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Kemp … may have some success linking his rival to Biden’s policies, especially among voters who are unhappy with what’s happening at the national level,” Johnson said. “That’s what I’ve seen in terms of the opposition’s narrative around Stacey Abrams — a sentiment that a vote for her would send the state in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the race for governor might be closer than we think. So far, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/25/georgia-early-vote-election-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnout in Georgia</a> is higher than it was four years ago, and the early vote <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/10/24/georgias-early-voting-turnout-so-far-blacker-older-recent-general-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently shows</a> a higher share of Black people voting this year than at this time in previous elections. “If Stacey Abrams is going to win or come close to winning, it’ll likely be because of early in-person voting or absentee ballots,” Peay said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to find that Stacey Abrams has a lead going into election night, and then it tightens as the night goes on.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the end, the outcome of Georgia’s gubernatorial race may come down to the fact that the environment is simply better for Kemp. Abrams can’t be counted out completely, but a win for her this year <em>does </em>seem far-fetched — especially compared with 2018.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, Alabama’s law banning abortion took effect. The next morning, phones began ringing in Georgia. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We got nearly 100 calls the day after the Dobbs decision from patients in Alabama,” said Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director of the Feminist Women’s Health Center in Atlanta. In states where abortion remains at least partially legal the phones haven’t stopped ringing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since June, thousands of Americans have crossed state lines seeking abortion, like a pressure wave spreading out from a blast zone. A data set shared exclusively with FiveThirtyEight shows that in the two months after the Supreme Court decision, there were 10,670 fewer abortions as compared to pre-Dobbs estimates. That figure is a net, counting both declines in some states and increases in others, and it shows how a few states are absorbing some — but not all — of the demand for abortions in states where it’s now banned. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Abortions rose just before Dobbs, then fell" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YFWgo/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The results suggest that in July and August, there were more than 10,000 people who “felt they had no options,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor and public health social scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. Along with Dr. Alison Norris, a professor of epidemiology at the Ohio State University, she co-chairs #WeCount, a <a href="https://societyfp.org/wecount/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national research project</a> led by the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit that supports research on abortion and contraception. “They couldn't travel, and they had to figure out what else to do,” Upadhyay said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Data compiled by #WeCount is designed to capture state-level information on abortion access in the wake of the Dobbs decision. This <a href="https://www.societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SFPWeCountReport_AprtoAug2022_ReleaseOct2022-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first data release</a> compares the number of legal abortions — including surgical and medication abortions — in each month from April to August 2022, showing how the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June has reshaped the abortion landscape. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That topline number conceals an enormous amount of fluctuation between states. In all states that saw declines in their abortion numbers — which include the 15 states in which abortion was banned or severely limited over the summer — the number of abortions fell by about 22,000.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This figure is based off #WeCount’s rounded estimates of the total number of abortions in each state and Washington, D.C. #WeCount provided monthly numbers of abortions provided by clinicians nationwide from April to August 2022. They received data from 100 percent of abortion providers in 29 states. In states where data from clinics was incomplete, the researchers used the data from available clinics and imputed the missing number of abortions each month from missing clinics by using estimates from several information sources, including state-level Guttmacher Institute data in 2020, state health departments, news articles, contacts known to missing clinics and knowledge of abortion volume by state. Self-managed abortions done without clinical support were not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> Some of those women appear to have traveled out of state, because in other states, the number of abortions rose by an aggregate of about 12,000. </p>

Between April and August, the number of abortions declined by 6 percent, and it’s likely that the decline in abortions represents thousands of women who sought abortions illegally or didn’t get one at all. If these trends persist, there could be at least 60,000 fewer abortions in the next year as a result of the Dobbs decision.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before the Dobbs ruling, getting an abortion <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/abortion-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was often an arduous, time-consuming and expensive process</a> — particularly in Southern and Midwestern states that passed hundreds of restrictions on abortion in the past decade. In 2018, researchers at UCSF <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5972217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified 27 “abortion deserts”</a> — cities with populations of more than 50,000 where the nearest abortion clinic was more than 100 miles away. Those preexisting reductions in access mean, Norris said, that their data shows a “decline from a very diminished place already.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s decision, though, turned entire regions of the country into abortion deserts. By the end of August, 11 states had banned abortion completely and four more had restricted it early in the first trimester.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion was banned in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas for all or most of July and August. Nineteenth-century bans on abortion were still on the books in Arizona and Wisconsin when Roe was overturned, and there were disputes in both states about whether the laws were still valid, but most or all abortion providers in both states stopped services during July and August because of the legal uncertainty. Abortion was banned until about six weeks of pregnancy in Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee for all or most of July and August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2022/10/100-days-post-roe-least-66-clinics-across-15-us-states-have-stopped-offering-abortion-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the Guttmacher Institute</a>, at least 66 clinics closed between the Dobbs decision and the end of October. </p>

Even before the ban, West Virginia’s lone abortion clinic was performing fewer abortions since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, in part because the state briefly banned abortion in July, as well. <p>Leah Willingham / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The #WeCount data suggests that thousands of Americans traveled long distances to obtain abortions in July and August. In just those 15 states where abortion was either banned or became illegal after six weeks in the wake of Dobbs, there was a reduction of approximately 21,000 abortions relative to April and May. In some states with total bans, like Alabama and Mississippi, the number of abortions fell to zero in July; in others, the numbers were drastically reduced but clinics were able to serve reduced numbers of patients due to court orders or slightly less stringent restrictions. Clustered together across the South and Upper Midwest, these states formed blocs where obtaining an abortion required leaving the region, rather than crossing a single border.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monthly change in abortion numbers is being measured relative to April because there is no national data tracking abortions by month for previous years. Broadly, annual data tracked by the Guttmacher Institute has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/24/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-u-s-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the annual number of abortions has been on the rise&lt;/a&gt; since 2017, after falling for more than two decades. Guttmacher’s most recent figures, from 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/06/long-term-decline-us-abortions-reverses-showing-rising-need-abortion-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;counted 930,160 abortions&lt;/a&gt;, or a monthly average of 77,513. In contrast, #WeCount estimated a monthly total of about 85,000 abortions in April 2022 and 79,600 abortions in August. But the researchers were confident this still represented a real loss of access, both because past trends predict that the number of abortions would have grown between 2020 and 2022; and because the sample set #WeCount uses is different than Guttmacher’s, including, for example, telehealth providers that are not captured in previous Guttmacher data.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2022/03/TxPEP-out-of-state-SB8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That trend began nearly a year earlier</a>, after the Supreme Court allowed Texas to enforce a ban on abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy in September 2021. Patients from Texas are now regularly seen in clinics as far away as Minnesota, and clinics in the lower Plains states began to see a domino effect in appointment scheduling. “Texas was going to Oklahoma and then Oklahoma started coming to us,” said Ashley Brink, director of the Trust Women clinic in Wichita, Kansas. After Oklahoma <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/26/1101428347/oklahoma-governor-signs-the-nations-strictest-abortion-ban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned abortion in May</a>, a full month before the Dobbs ruling, Brink said that her clinic ended up with more than 50 percent of the patients coming from out of state. </p>

Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who studies abortion, has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/it-can-already-take-weeks-to-get-an-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since March</a> been monitoring wait times at clinics in states where abortion remained legal. She found that by early August, only two of Kansas’s five abortion clinics were scheduling appointments, and the first available times were eight and 13 weekdays away.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since March, Myers and a team of student researchers have been calling every abortion clinic in Myers’s database of abortion providers who advertise their services publicly. In their calls, the researchers pose as pregnant women, saying they’re about six weeks pregnant and want the nearest possible abortion appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> That month, the median wait time in Colorado and New Mexico was over two weeks. Waits for appointments at abortion clinics in southern Illinois were also higher than they were earlier in the summer. In August, 74 percent of patients at Planned Parenthood’s clinic in Asheville, North Carolina, came from outside the state, and the average wait time for a medication abortion was three weeks, <a href="https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/ppsat_v._moore_20cvs500147_pls_memo_of_law_iso_mot._for_partial_preliminary_injunction.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a recent legal filing</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Someone who lives three minutes, three miles from our clinic, is struggling to get an appointment and is now getting displaced to Colorado or Illinois,” Brink said. Travel comes with a different set of difficulties: <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2022/03/TxPEP-out-of-state-SB8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Texas study</a> conducted in the aftermath of the state’s six-week ban found that some women who left the state delayed rent or bills to cover the cost, or were even fired because of their extended time away from work. And some states, like Kansas and Pennsylvania, still require prospective abortion patients to comply with waiting periods and other logistical hurdles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A likely consequence of longer wait times and travel distances is more abortions later in pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that only <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.7 percent of all abortions happen between the 14th and 20th week</a> of pregnancy. But between 20 and 30 percent of current patients are in the second trimester at Whole Woman's Health of Minnesota, a clinic located in a state where abortion is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.minnpost.com/health/2022/07/does-minnesota-law-have-a-viability-threshold-limiting-abortion-well-that-depends/" target="_blank">legal until the point of fetal viability</a> around 25 weeks, according to Sean Mehl, Whole Woman's assistant director of clinical services.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the traffic jams backing up service in clinics, the #WeCount data shows that the number of abortions nationwide did briefly increase in the weeks before the Dobbs ruling, as clinics across the country crammed patients into their schedules, accomodating as many as possible while abortion remained legal nationwide. Although abortion rates <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010782416303997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually dip a bit during the summer</a>, the number of abortions this year rose 4 percent from May to June. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Georgia, where there was no trigger law but where restrictions were almost certainly imminent, clinics kept up that pace after Dobbs for as long as they could. According to the #WeCount data, abortions in Georgia declined only 6 percent from June to July, despite the fact that a federal court allowed the state’s six-week abortion ban to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/us/georgia-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go into effect on July 20</a>. The number of abortions dropped by more than 50 percent from July to August. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg" alt='A pin reading "Welcome to Illinois" hangs on a basket at the Hope Clinic for Women' data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1241616426-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption><p>ANGELA WEISS / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Where abortion remains legal, some abortion providers have been able to increase capacity. Staffing wasn’t an issue for Whole Woman’s Health in Minnesota or Trust Women in Kansas — by the summer, they were flying in doctors from across the country to fill in their schedules, with more people reaching out to see if they could volunteer. “Since Dobbs, our Minnesota clinic has seen about a 50 percent increase in overall patients,” Mehl said. Virtual abortion providers, which can prescribe abortion pills online in the states where it’s legal to do so, also ramped up their medication abortion services. The #WeCount researchers found that the number of abortions offered through online-only clinics — not counting telehealth abortions offered through brick-and-mortar facilities — increased by 33 percent between April and August.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some women may also be getting abortions without any clinic or doctor being involved — although those numbers are hard to track. The #WeCount data counts only <em>legal</em> abortions, which means it’s almost certainly underestimating the total number. Even before Dobbs, activist groups and online pharmacies <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/european-doctor-prescribes-abortion-pills-u-s-women-over-internet-n1012676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were providing abortion pills</a> directly to consumers through the mail. By July, Mexican activists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/world/americas/abortion-pills-mexico-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were already reporting</a> that they were inundated with requests for abortion pills from women all over the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also likely that some people who might have gotten an abortion in the pre-Dobbs era are simply carrying their pregnancies to term. And while that is a victory for anti-abortion advocates, the #WeCount researchers noted that there is substantial evidence that being denied a wanted abortion puts people at <a href="https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/the_harms_of_denying_a_woman_a_wanted_abortion_4-16-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increased risk of poverty, physical abuse and certain health problems</a>. They’re also keeping an eye on whether maternal and infant mortality will increase in states with abortion bans — particularly since <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/overturning-roe-v-wade-could-make-maternal-mortality-even-worse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those states tend to have higher-than-average rates</a> of deaths from pregnancy complications.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Norris said it’s possible that out-of-state travel might get more difficult as time goes by. Abortion funds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/abortion-funds-donations-roe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised millions of dollars</a> in the aftermath of Dobbs, which may have made it more possible for women to travel than it was in the past. But over time, volunteers’ enthusiasm or financial support to organizations like abortion funds might start to ebb. “We don’t know if it’s sustainable,” Norris said. And with more states poised to implement abortion bans in the next few months, the numbers from this report are just an early signal of a future where abortions could be even more scarce.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Nov. 1, 12:23 p.m.):</strong> After publication, #WeCount updated its topline estimate for the change in how many people were able to obtain abortion care in the two months following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The number is now 10,670, not 10,570, after the organization accounted for rounding in state-level estimates.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">With less than two weeks until Election Day, Republicans now have a 48 percent chance of taking the Senate, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Deluxe forecast, their highest figure since late July and putting the battle for Senate control <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-is-a-toss-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially in toss-up territory</a>. But whether that shift will continue or has peaked is in the eye of the beholder.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most recently, the GOP hasn’t seen the rapid gains in the forecast that they did a week or two ago, and if you scroll through our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest polls page</a>, you can find <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_ga_102622/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a</a> <a href="https://www.bw.edu/news/2022/fall/us-senate-race-remains-close-in-final-bw-ohio-pulse-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decent</a> <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2022/10/dfp_nh_midterm_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number</a> of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/politics/cnn-poll-senate-races-wisconsin-pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> that have good news for Democrats along with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gop-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite a few others</a> that look strong for Republicans. Still, the current picture leaves Democrats without much margin to spare. Unless they can pull off an upset in North Carolina, Ohio, or Wisconsin, Democrats will need to win two of the three closest Senate races — Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada — in order to maintain their majority, while also holding Arizona and New Hampshire.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the House, meanwhile, Republicans have an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81 percent chance of taking over the chamber</a>, putting Democrats in a tough — although hardly impossible — position. (<a href="http://twodimes.net/poker/?g=h&amp;b=&amp;d=&amp;h=Ac+Ad%0D%0A5c+5d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In poker terms</a>, it’s as though they have pocket 5’s against pocket aces.) Unlike in the Senate, Democrats will have to do more than just win the majority of toss-up races to control the House. In fact, there are now 219 seats that our model rates as lean Republican, likely Republican or solid Republican, one more than the 218 needed for a majority. So even if Democrats won <em>all</em> the toss-ups, it wouldn’t quite be enough.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, in practice, in an election where things are going well enough for Democrats to win all the toss-ups, they’d probably pick up their fair share of lean Republican seats too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> To keep the House, Democrats will need for our model to be systematically underestimating them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That can happen — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast and polling errors are correlated</a>. That said, what the <em>polls</em> say and what the FiveThirtyEight <em>forecast</em> says are not quite the same. Most importantly, our Deluxe forecast already assumes the Republicans probably <em>will</em> beat what polls currently show.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Below, you can find a comparison between the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling average</a> for each Senate race where we calculate a polling average, and the projected margin of victory or defeat in the same races according to the Deluxe forecast:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Ohio, for instance, Democrat Tim Ryan trails by only 1.4 percentage points in our polling average, but is projected to lose by 4.5 points, which implies a 3-point polling bias against Republican J.D. Vance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s on the high side for the competitive Senate races, but the Deluxe forecast does expect Republicans to somewhat overperform their polls in most of the other competitive races: by 1 to 2 points in Georgia and North Carolina, and by about 1 point in Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania. It doesn’t expect much polling bias in Arizona and New Hampshire, by contrast.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some of the less competitive races, the Deluxe forecasts thinks the bias could be more severe. Check out Iowa, Missouri and Oklahoma, for instance, where Republicans are projected to do much better than their polling — although there are relatively few recent polls of Missouri and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Democrats are expected to outperform their polls in blue-state races such as Washington, Connecticut, Illinois and New York.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To some degree, this <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matches the pattern from previous years</a>, although not perfectly so.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t expecting an especially large polling error in Wisconsin, for instance, where polls were poor in 2016 and 2020 — although the polls have Republican Ron Johnson ahead there anyway, so he doesn’t need a polling error to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> But one fairly good heuristic is simply that Republicans tend to outperform their polls in red states, while Democrats do so in blue states — see the map below for an example of this from 2016.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why do Republicans do better in the forecast than the polling average? There isn’t any built-in <a href="https://gelliottmorris.substack.com/p/the-polling-website-where-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unskewing</a> or assumption of polling bias in the model. Rather, it’s a bunch of little things that tend to add up:</p>



<ul><li>Our forecast makes additional adjustments to the polls beyond what is shown in our polling averages. In particular, this includes a likely voter adjustment and a timeline adjustment, both of which help Republicans at the margin. The likely voter adjustment helps Republicans because they tend to do better in polls of likely voters than registered ones.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we’re at the point now where there are relatively few registered-voter polls of Senate races, so this doesn’t make much difference in most races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> The timeline adjustment accounts for how the generic ballot has shifted since polls were conducted, and since it’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/">shifted in a somewhat Republican direction recently</a>, that tends to help the GOP too.</li><li>In some states — Rust Belt swing states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and redder ones like Iowa and Missouri — the “fundamentals” our model considers are more favorable for Republicans than the polls. The most important of these is simply <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/">overall state partisanship</a>. Republicans have done fairly well in these states in recent years, so you might expect them to do well again in what is likely to be a fairly good year nationally for the party.</li><li>In addition, the model considers macro-level fundamentals, such as the poor historic performance of the president’s party at the midterms, and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">President Biden’s mediocre approval ratings</a>. So the model endorses the idea that Democrats <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/democrats-agonize-2022-election-facing-political-gravity-final-stretch-rcna54148">have been coming back to gravity</a>. These factors zero out in the model by Election Day, though, so they don’t have too much effect now given how close we are to the election.</li><li>Finally, the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">expert ratings</a> that the Deluxe model uses are more bullish for Republicans in several key Senate races than polls and other objective indicators.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">While none of this is good news for Democrats, it should guard against one potential misinterpretation of our forecast. You might be tempted to take the FiveThirtyEight Deluxe forecast, and then mentally shade it further to Republicans because you worry that the polls could underestimate Republicans again. Heck, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-reasons-for-democrats-to-still-be-concerned-about-the-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’ve even been tempted to do this myself</a>. But the Deluxe forecast <em>already assumes</em> that Republicans will do better than what current polls show, by around 2 percentage points in the average Congressional race. You may be double-counting, in other words, if you take the Deluxe forecast and then assume additional polling bias on top of it. Some of it is already baked into the model.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court is poised to upend <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/when-the-supreme-court-first-ruled-on-affirmative-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades of precedent</a> on affirmative action. This Monday, the justices <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/01/court-will-hear-challenges-to-affirmative-action-at-harvard-and-university-of-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will hear two cases</a> challenging race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. The universities use race as one of many factors when deciding which applicants to accept — a practice that has been <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/76-811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affirmed multiple times</a> by the Supreme Court, including in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/02-241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2003 case</a> where the justices ruled that ensuring racial diversity in higher education is important enough to justify the limited use of race in college admissions. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, just months after the Supreme Court upended a decades-old precedent on abortion rights, the precedent on affirmative action is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-supreme-court-appears-ready-finally-to-defeat-affirmative-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in peril</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Although public opinion on abortion is complex</a>, Americans mostly did not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the constitutional right to abortion. But a ruling limiting or ending affirmative action in higher education — though it would have a huge impact on college admissions — is less likely to draw public outrage. That’s because affirmative action is unpopular, even though Americans do want there to be diversity in higher education.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, a <a href="https://docs-cdn-prod.news-engineering.aws.wapo.pub/publish_document/590f3120-fdce-40b3-80b1-8b2ddbc5147d/published/590f3120-fdce-40b3-80b1-8b2ddbc5147d.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post/Schar School poll</a> conducted Oct. 7-10 found that near-identical shares of Americans supported a Supreme Court ruling “banning colleges and universities from considering a student’s race and ethnicity when making decisions about student admissions” (63 percent), <em>and</em> thought programs that promote racial diversity in higher education are a good thing (64 percent). This is a great example of one of the central tensions in how Americans think about race-conscious admissions: Many people are uncomfortable with the concept of singling out racial minorities for special treatment if it means other students will have to meet a higher standard, even though they also want universities to have racially diverse student bodies.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ ambivalence about affirmative action is strong enough that a small tweak in question wording can result in a very different result. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/05/4-race-immigration-and-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pew Research Center poll conducted in 2017</a> found that a sizable majority (71 percent) of Americans said that “affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses” are a good thing. Of course, this number might have changed over the past few years, but it suggests that reminding respondents about the aims of affirmative action programs — rather than simply telling them how race-conscious admissions works, as the Washington Post/Schar School poll did — may change the way people think about the concept.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/21/american-attitudes-college-affirmative-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A YouGov poll conducted in April</a> tested this theory and found that framing does matter. When respondents were asked whether they supported or opposed “an affirmative action program for higher education that increases the share of Black and Hispanic students at selective institutions in the United States,” there wasn’t a clear consensus: Thirty-seven percent supported the programs, 34 percent opposed them and 29 percent said they weren’t sure. But a much larger majority (68 percent) said that race should not “be considered when evaluating [a student’s] admission to college,” and a plurality (46 percent) agreed that “[q]ualified minorities” should <em>not</em> be given “special preferences in higher education.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p><div><iframe title="Question wording matters greatly in polls on affirmative action" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NMywM/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="402" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Washington Post/Schar School poll also found that larger shares of Americans thought that white students (62 percent) and Asian students (66 percent) have “a fair chance” of getting into a good college, compared with the shares who thought the same about Black students (43 percent) and Hispanic and Latino students (44 percent). Despite this consensus that discrimination exists in college admissions, Americans are much less likely to favor affirmative action when it’s framed as a zero-sum game. (This feeling that the playing field should be level extends beyond affirmative action: The Washington Post/Schar School poll found Americans were overwhelmingly likely to oppose preferential treatment for applicants whose parents went to the same school.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">YouGov also conducted an experiment as part of their April poll, asking half the sample what they thought about an affirmative action program that would “increase the share of Black and Hispanic students,” while asking the other half what they thought about an affirmative action program that would “decrease the share of Asian and white students.” Respondents who said they supported “affirmative action in college admissions” (an earlier question in the poll) were much more likely to say they supported a program increasing the share of Black and Hispanic students (70 percent) than a program decreasing the share of Asian and white students (37 percent), indicating that even those in favor of race-conscious admissions in theory don’t like the idea of giving some students a boost at other racial and ethnic groups’ expense.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what does all of this mean for the Supreme Court? The two cases facing the justices raise slightly different issues: <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/222325/20220502145522418_20-1199%2021-707%20SFFA%20Brief%20to%20file%20final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard is accused</a> of unconstitutionally discriminating against Asian American applicants through its race-conscious process, while <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-707/234417/20220824170858314_21-707%20Reply%20Brief%20Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the challenge against UNC-Chapel Hill argues</a> that considering race in admissions violates civil rights law and the Constitution. As the cases have unfolded, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universities across the country</a> have weighed in, many saying that race-conscious admissions actually are the best way to ensure a racially diverse student body — and that without it, there will be fewer minority students at selective schools. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even though the justices <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled only six years ago</a> that the University of Texas could consider race in its admissions process, the court is much more conservative now, and it seems likely that the justices will limit how universities can use race as a factor for admissions, or ban it entirely. And if that happens, many Americans may think that’s the right outcome — particularly if the justices say they’re acting to protect Asian American students from discrimination.</p>



<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>Early voting for the midterm elections is underway <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/25/georgia-early-vote-election-2022/">in some states</a>. According to a recently released <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403052/eight-americans-favor-early-voting-photo-laws.aspx">Gallup poll</a>, which was conducted in July, a heavy majority of Americans (78 percent) favored early-voting options, although there is a partisan split, with early voting supported by 95 percent of Democrats but only 60 percent of Republicans. Americans of color (84 percent) were also more likely than white Americans (76 percent) to agree. Furthermore, the poll found a wide gap along racial lines related to absentee ballots: While three-quarters (75 percent) of Americans of color supported sending absentee ballots to all eligible voters, just over half of white Americans (53 percent) endorsed the same. </li><li>An <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/half-of-america-expecting-fraud-in-midterm-elections-poll-finds/3186528/">LX News/YouGov poll</a> conducted Oct. 12-14 found that roughly half of Americans (49 percent) believed there will be at least some voter fraud in the midterms. That number jumped to 71 percent among Republicans and 78 percent among those who said they voted for Trump in 2020. An equal share of both groups (34 percent) believed fraud could be rampant enough to impact control of Congress. Specifically, a large share of 2020 Trump voters were at least somewhat concerned that illegal ballots will be cast by people lying about citizenship status (84 percent), trying to vote more than once (81 percent) or using a fake name (80 percent).</li><li>A plurality of Americans (44 percent) said that supporting Iranians demonstrating for women’s rights was more important than reentering a nuclear deal with the nation, <a href="https://tippinsights.com/shock-poll-americans-prioritize-womens-rights-in-iran-over-nuclear-deal-after-mahsa-aminis-murder/">per an Oct. 5-7 TIPP poll</a>. Just 24 percent expressed the opposite, with an additional 31 percent of Americans not sure. The prioritization of civil liberties over nuclear treaties held true regardless of political affiliation, with 50 percent of Democrats, 43 percent of independents and 40 percent of Republicans saying supporting women’s rights protestors was more important. This suggests that Americans are paying attention to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/iranians-are-ready-for-a-different-approach-to-religion-and-government/">ongoing protests in Iran</a> after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in the custody of the country’s “morality police.” Prior to that event, TIPP polling from July shows that a majority of Americans (55 percent) wanted the Biden administration to make a nuclear deal with Iran. </li><li>Americans are divided over which country poses the greatest national security threat to the United States, according to a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2022/10/25/17e1e/1">YouGov poll</a> conducted on Oct. 25. Two-thirds were roughly split between choosing China (34 percent) and Russia (30 percent), while the rest were either not sure (16 percent) or divvied up among less popular choices, like North Korea (8 percent), Iran (4 percent) and Afghanistan (3 percent). But there is also a partisan division at play: Half of Republicans said China was the greatest national security threat, while 43 percent of Democrats named Russia. </li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>
