<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">You can see it at the grocery store, the gas station and your heating bill (though, mercifully, <a href="https://qz.com/2087483/alcohol-and-air-travel-resisted-high-us-inflation-in-october-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not at the liquor store</a>): Prices are getting higher. Since October of last year, prices for consumer goods have risen 6.2 percent — the biggest year-over-year increase since 1990 — according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released Wednesday</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices are on the rise in nearly every category, including gas, food and housing, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/how-the-supply-chain-caused-current-inflation-and-why-it-might-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely as a result</a> of supply chain disruption, labor shortages and lingering effects of the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/11/10/22775092/inflation-cpi-october-economy-biden-fed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mix</a> of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/economy/consumer-price-inflation-october/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coverage</a> in the media, the prevailing message from officials seems to be “don’t panic.” The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/with-bond-buying-taper-bag-fed-turns-wary-eye-inflation-2021-11-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicts this period</a> of rising prices to be “transitory,” and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/10/1054019175/inflation-surges-to-its-highest-since-1990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are signs</a> that price increases are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/inflation-may-cool-off-in-november-and-december-shipping-data-suggests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to slow</a>. But in the meantime, Americans are worried about inflation, and most blame the Biden administration, according to recent polls. It’s why Biden <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-10/biden-says-addressing-rising-inflation-is-a-priority-for-his-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched gears this week</a>, going from celebrating the passage of his bipartisan infrastructure bill to addressing inflation concerns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you haven’t noticed prices going up, you’re in the minority. Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults said gas prices had gone up “a lot,” and 65 percent said food prices had gone up “a lot,” according to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/87gqotkd1s/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted Nov. 6-9. One in four Americans said they spent more on groceries in October, compared with September, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 3. And <a href="https://scottrasmussen.com/77-have-recently-experienced-sharp-price-increases-while-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Scott Rasmussen national survey</a> conducted Oct. 11-13 found that 77 percent of registered voters had “recently experienced sharp increases in the cost of items they would like to buy.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also anticipating prices to continue to rise, especially as we head into the holiday season. In <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/expected-price-hikes-food-travel-tech-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a different Morning Consult poll</a>, which was conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 1, a majority of Americans anticipated prices for consumer tech, food, travel, toys and jewelry would be higher this year than in previous years, and planned to compensate for the increase by hunting for deals. As the holidays approach, consumers have been most concerned about the cost of meat, produce and dairy, according to the <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Morning Consult poll</a>. Forty-eight percent of Americans were “very concerned” about the cost of meat, 37 percent about produce and 33 percent about dairy. A plurality of consumers (46 percent) said they “often” compared prices to reduce their grocery costs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are not happy about these price increases. In a <a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_DailyKos_monthly_banner_book_2021_10_h82c93.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Kos/Civiqs poll</a> conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 2, 78 percent of registered voters said they were dissatisfied with the price of gas (only 5 percent said they were satisfied) and 75 percent said they were dissatisfied with the price of consumer goods like food, clothing and household items. This dissatisfaction about the price of consumer goods was highest among Republicans, at 92 percent, compared with 57 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of independents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are feeling the price increases in their pocketbooks. That Economist/YouGov poll found 56 percent of Americans said it was at least somewhat difficult to afford gas, with 55 percent saying the same about food and 48 percent saying the same about housing costs. <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-16-19_Complete_National_Topline_October-21-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Fox News poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-19 showed concern about inflation was higher than it’d been for the past four months, with 87 percent of registered voters saying they were “very” or “extremely” concerned about inflation and higher prices.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Increased prices can <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/05/1024139056/inflation-is-a-big-political-test-for-president-bidens-economic-agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact voters’ political views</a> of the economy overall because their effects are felt so immediately, contributing to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s negative approval rating</a>. “There is a psychology to inflation that is different from everything else, and it tends to drive how people view the economy because they experience it every day whether it is at the grocery store, gas pump or buying household goods,” John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-10/biden-says-addressing-rising-inflation-is-a-priority-for-his-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Los Angeles Times</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polling captures how voters are thinking about inflation as a political issue. A plurality of registered voters (40 percent) said the Biden administration’s policies were “very responsible” for the inflation, and a majority (62 percent) said the administration’s policies were at least “somewhat responsible,” <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/20054637/2110084_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-18. In a <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HHP_October2021_Topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard/Harris poll</a> conducted Oct. 27-28, 56 percent of registered voters said they weren’t confident in the Biden administration’s ability to keep inflation at bay, and 53 percent said the same about the Federal Reserve’s ability. A majority (56 percent) said that Congress passing a $1.5 to $2 trillion social spending bill (such as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-repeats-worries-about-inflation-amid-final-social-spending-bill-n1283670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one they’re currently trying to pass</a>) would lead to more inflation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the public reaction is out of step with expert forecasts, their fears should not be brushed aside. Some economists theorize that, left unchecked, fears about inflation can make the situation worse <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/inflation-expectations-and-what-it-could-mean-for-markets-bmo-capital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by creating a self-fulfilling prophecy</a> in which employees, afraid of rising prices, demand higher wages, the costs of which employers would then cover through raising prices, leading to higher inflation. This is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22576069/inflation-1970s-volcker-powell-federal-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what happened in the 1970s</a>, and it led to nearly double-digit inflation rates. Regardless of how transitory the Fed thinks these price increases will be, Americans are worried right now.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The 2022 midterm elections are a little less than a year away, and an endorsement from Biden, whose approval rating is low, may not be an attractive option for all candidates. Most likely voters (51 percent) said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by the president, per a <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/november_2021/most_voters_say_biden_endorsement_would_hurt_local_candidates">Rasmussen Reports poll</a>. </li><li>Americans <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/cnn-poll-biden-job-approval/index.html">aren’t satisfied</a> with how Biden has handled what they say is the nation’s top issue: the economy. A plurality of Americans (36 percent) said the economy was the most important issue in the U.S., according to a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/11/08/rel7a.-.politics.pdf">recent CNN/SSRS poll</a>. And a majority (58 percent) said Biden hadn’t paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems. </li><li>COVID-19 cases have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/after-weeks-of-declines-us-covid-cases-have-leveled-off-at-a-high-level-the-ers-are-packed.html">stopped declining in the U.S.</a>, but many Americans are ready to return to pre-COVID life. Per a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">recent Axios/Ipsos poll</a>, a small majority of Americans (55 percent) thought returning to their pre-COVID lives now came at a small risk or no risk to their health, and 50 percent of Americans said they felt they were at less risk of contracting COVID-19 now, compared with April 2020. </li><li>About <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/white-house-900000-kids-virus-shots-1st-week-81080149">900,000 children ages 5 to 11 received their first dose</a> of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine just one week after the vaccine was approved for that age group. Before the vaccine was approved, an October <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-october-2021/">Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a> found just 27 percent of parents with children ages 5 to 11 said they would vaccinate their kids “right away” once eligible. That hesitancy was in large part about the long-term effects of the vaccine in children (76 percent of parents surveyed) and that their child might have serious side effects from the vaccine (71 percent).</li><li>On Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/travel/usa-travel-restrictions.html#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20reopened%20its,of%20dollars%20in%20tourism%20revenue.">the U.S. lifted a travel ban for vaccinated visitors</a> from 33 countries, including Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom. But some international travelers don’t feel comfortable traveling to the U.S. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/04/international-travel-united-states-covid/">Morning Consult poll</a> found that 60 percent of Canadian adults didn’t feel comfortable planning a trip anywhere in the U.S. and 41 percent of Mexican adults are uncomfortable. In Europe, 45 percent of adults in the United Kingdom, 42 percent in Germany and 36 percent in France were uncomfortable planning a trip to the U.S. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">One day last spring, Naima Kaidi waited nearly an hour for her kindergartener and first-grader to get home from school. She stood on the corner near her house, but the bus was nowhere to be seen and there was no word why it was so late. Northport Elementary in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, had only recently reopened for in-person classes, and day after day, Kaidi’s family had been struggling with late school bus drop-offs. This day was the worst. Cold and worried, she eventually carried her younger children back home to get her phone and try to find out what was going on — and that was when she got a knock on the door. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was Roberta Steele, who had driven the school bus in Kaidi’s neighborhood for years, there to bring the two children home. Steele knew where the kids on her route lived. She knew who their parents were. And even though it wasn’t her fault that the bus was late, Steele made sure the kids arrived home safely. “She helped me, she [brought] my kids over here,” Kaidi said. Even if the bus system wasn’t reliable, the driver was. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that was last school year. Even then there was already a shortage of bus drivers in the district. Steele said that had been the case for years, though district representatives were quick to point out that there had never been a shortage of this magnitude. This fall, the shortage became dire enough that Steele’s old route — the one where she knew all the kids well enough to take them to their doorsteps when needed — was consolidated out of existence. In October, the district told parents that <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/education/robbinsdale-area-schools-bus-driver-shortage/89-0e254e80-1e44-4171-97c9-6b2d509d1da6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 routes probably wouldn’t be staffed</a> this year. Steele was transferred to a different route with new kids, and sometimes the chaos of route changes and late buses meant she also had to drive kids home from other, equally unfamiliar routes.</p>

The kids don’t behave. Some, unsure of their own addresses, can’t tell Steele where to go. When parents get angry at a system that isn’t working, they blame Steele. And the company that runs the buses has packed her schedule to the point that there’s no longer time left to pee between runs. She’s thinking of quitting, even though she knows that will make things even harder for the families relying on her.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Kaidi’s family spent the first two months of school with no bus at all. Instead of waiting at her corner with other parents, she spent her afternoons sitting in her car in the pickup line outside school. The line backed up for blocks, 40 or 50 cars deep, threading out of the parking lot and down an undulating suburban road. Kaidi had to get there an hour before school ended just to make sure she was near the front. She says she turned down a job so she could do this. Likewise, other parents had to change their hours, lose pay and go without sleep — all to sit in their cars, waiting for their children. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the bus driver shortage continues, parents and drivers, often women on both sides, have been stretched to the breaking point as they try to do more with less — less time, less money, less help, less of a sense of safety and respect. “This problem existed before COVID, but nobody wanted to hear about it, especially the school districts,” said <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10129300/whats-really-causing-the-decimation-of-the-school-bus-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zina Ronca</a>, a driver supervisor for DuVall Bus Service in West Grove, Pennsylvania, who has been <a href="https://stnonline.com/blogs/the-decimation-of-school-bus-contractors-and-the-school-bus-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the industry for nearly two decades</a>. There haven’t been enough school bus drivers nationwide for years. But it took a pandemic to make that shortage visible and painful to more than just the drivers themselves. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg" alt="Parents wait in line in their cars to drop off their kids at an Orlando, Florida elementary school" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1234721462-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>In part because of the bus driver shortages, long lines of cars — like this one in Orlando, Florida — have been a mainstay at schools this fall. <p>Paul Hennessy / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And in that way, what’s happening at Northport Elementary reflects an even bigger problem for schools nationwide. Across the country, reports have documented shortages of substitute teachers, school nurses, cafeteria workers and the paraprofessionals who help teachers manage their workloads and give kids more small-group attention. As with drivers, those shortages existed before anyone had ever heard of COVID-19. The problems were there, waiting, and then the pandemic came along and made them simultaneously more visible and more … just <em>more</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All these jobs are about service and care, at pay scales that simply aren’t competitive with jobs that use similar skills but don’t require child care balanced precariously on top of other demands. And when the people who do those jobs quit, the effects get tangled up with other parts of the economy and other parts of society. Amid the pandemic, individual workers are making choices for themselves and their families that affect other people’s families and jobs in ways nobody quite expected. The bus driver shortage isn’t just a bus driver shortage — it’s a knot nobody knows how to cut. </p>



<hr><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg" alt="Bus driver Roberta Steele" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL113-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">When I pictured the village of people who would help me raise my children, the person driving them to and from school didn’t come immediately to mind. But in the third year of school disruption, it turns out that the bus driver is a person in your neighborhood whom you miss when you don’t see them every day. The job involves only a minimal amount of interaction, Roberta Steele told me. But it’s daily interaction. “You know you’re making a difference for some kids, and that brings me great joy,” she said. “I have kids that I had in middle school that are now in high school. And they will walk from the high school to the middle school just to say hi.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele, 50, is a barrel-chested woman with cropped, spiky hair the color of her last name. She comes off as perky and outgoing, basically the vibe of a favorite grade-school gym teacher. She doesn’t have kids of her own but places a lot of value in the role she can play in the lives of other people’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele has been driving a school bus since 2014, all of it for Robbinsdale School District 281, one of those sprawling suburban districts that encompass schools and children in multiple cities on the fringes of Minneapolis. She took the job after leaving the Minneapolis Police Reserve but almost quit in the first two years. The kids were just a lot. A typical school bus can carry 70 children when full. They get bored, or they just plain don’t know how to behave. “I resorted to bribery as a method of training,” she told me, using small treats to manage the threat of prepubescent uprisings. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="774" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg" alt="Students board a school bus while wearing face masks" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1271435530-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Kids have had to navigate a new normal on school buses during the pandemic. But bus shortages aren’t a new normal for school districts. They were there before the pandemic and are still there now. <p>Alex Kormann / Star Tribune via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Today, she can quell most bad behavior with a look delivered through the rearview mirror. Her starting pay, driving a 15-ton vehicle down the winding, narrow roads of inner-ring suburbs while managing the behavior of a small village worth of kids, and for which she needed to take classes and earn a special license, was $14 an hour. “It’s really rewarding, or it can be, if you like children, right?” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But not everyone does. Or, at least, not at that price point. Steele’s entire bus driving career has been marked by not having enough colleagues. She told me she found the job in the first place because the district was recruiting heavily to fill a shortage, though representatives from the district stressed that they had never had a shortage like this before. Nationwide, more than 50 percent of districts have experienced a shortage of drivers every year since at least 2006, according to <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10003422/how-school-bus-driver-shortage-is-linked-to-unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual surveys conducted by School Bus Fleet magazine</a>. Most years, the driver shortage affected more than 70 percent of districts. The lowest the shortage has been in all that time was in the depths of the Great Recession.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Over the years, as shortages continued, Steele’s pay did increase. Today, after a big post-COVID pay raise, she’s making $23.75 per hour, well above the nationwide average starting pay for school bus drivers, $18.82 per hour according to <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/research/download?id=10145046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2021 survey</a>. </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">At year-round, full-time hours — the way the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533058.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculates an annual wage</a> — the average school bus driver makes more than $39,000 a year. But school bus drivers don’t work year-round, full-time hours. “We’re only guaranteed four hours of pay a day,” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are no paid holidays or sick days, she and other bus industry experts say. Benefits vary from company to company, and there’s no guaranteed work at all in summer. “Spring break is all unpaid. Every teacher-compensatory day, every snow day, any time they cannot pay us they will,” Steele said. She added that a recent, failed unionization effort among the Robbinsdale bus drivers started in part as a fight for snow-day pay. </p>

This is part of why the job has long attracted women — particularly mothers — who were able to work while their children were at school. In 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58.5 percent of all school bus drivers were women</a>. The hours are predictable and short, with a gap in the middle of the day when your time is your own, during which some drivers earn money doing other jobs, like working as a mechanic for the bus company, or doing a different caregiving job in schools. And the job comes with unusual perks like the ability to take the bus home, turning the morning commute into a walk to the driveway. At some bus companies and school districts, drivers have the freedom to take their young children on the bus with them during their rounds — a chance to bring in money without adding to the ever-rising cost of day care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/burgoyne-allen-5-things-to-know-about-americas-school-bus-driver-shortage-what-states-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t pay enough to live on</a>. For Steele, the job works only because her partner brings in a paycheck and benefits. Other drivers depend on a second job, performed between roughly 9 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., when they aren’t on the clock. LaShawn Favors, a bus driver in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park, had a second part-time job as a paraprofessional in a school while his wife worked from home in the health-care industry. His route didn’t overlap with where his own kids, who lacked reliable bus service, needed to go, so his wife and his daughter’s boyfriend were stuck shuttling the kids to and from school while Favors rushed from one job to another and back to the first.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Drivers spackle their work lives together this way, with voluntary overtime and luck, and they still struggle. <a href="https://bellwethereducation.org/publication/challenges-and-opportunities-school-transportation-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID didn’t make the job hard</a>, it just made it harder.</p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Pay is the problem, and COVID made it worse by threatening the unique benefits that kept people driving buses, despite the low pay, to begin with. Older drivers suddenly had to deal with the increased risk of sickness and death, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/we-feel-your-grief-remembering-the-1-000-plus-educators-whove-died-of-covid-19/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks that haven’t really been properly calculated</a> anywhere. No one knows how many bus drivers are no longer in their jobs because they <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/mounting-covid-deaths-fuel-school-bus-drivers-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died from COVID-19 infections</a> acquired on the job, because no one is keeping track. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other drivers had no real choice but to find other work during the long months when schools were remote and had no need of them, while drivers who were mothers found themselves trying to juggle home and work in a job they’d taken precisely so they wouldn’t have to do this in the first place. When schools moved to hybrid systems, the districts needed drivers every day, but those drivers’ own kids’ schedules may not have been in sync, said Erin Ducharme, vice chair of membership for the Women in Buses Council and an executive at Bloom Tour and Charter Services in Taunton, Massachusetts. </p>

Like drivers, school nurses are most likely to be women, and they earn far less than what they could get if they took their skills and training elsewhere — as little as <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$58,810 in median annual wages</a> compared with more than $75,000 if they worked in a hospital. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nationwide, there have been reports of shortages of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/09/06/school-cafeterias-are-looking-for-workers-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cafeteria workers</a>, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/no-bus-drivers-custodians-or-subs-whats-really-behind-schools-staffing-shortages/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custodians, substitute teachers</a> and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-staff-shortages-are-crushing-schools/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paraprofessionals</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-bad-are-school-staffing-shortages-what-we-learned-by-asking-administrators/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted by EdWeek Research Center</a> in late September and early October, 40 percent of district leaders and principals said they were experiencing “severe” or “very severe” staffing shortages. The bus driver shortage is part of a larger, longer problem in schools — one that extends beyond the school building. When “women’s jobs” go unfilled, other women, namely moms, pick up the slack — and the effects reverberate across the economy. </p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Caregiving is interconnected. Roberta Steele doesn’t just drive a bus. She drove a bus to pick up and drop off Naima Kaidi’s children. Without Steele’s services, Kaidi still had to get the kids to school. But the task became harder and required her to make more sacrifices. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Parents like Kaidi depend on the services of bus drivers, nurses, lunch ladies and subs. Statistically, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/17/the-pandemic-has-highlighted-many-challenges-for-mothers-but-they-arent-necessarily-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the parents who depend on those services the most are moms</a> — they still do more of the parenting labor, and their own jobs become more disrupted when there aren’t other women doing the outsourced work for things like transportation or food preparation. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/12/despite-challenges-at-home-and-work-most-working-moms-and-dads-say-being-employed-is-whats-best-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 Pew Research Center survey</a> of adults in opposite-sex relationships found that 59 percent of women reported handling more of the household chores and responsibilities than their partners, and among those with children under 18 at home, 78 percent of women reported doing more work to manage their children’s activities and schedules. Working mothers were more likely than working fathers to report having to reduce work hours to deal with household or family needs. And during the pandemic, women were twice as likely as men to say they had to juggle “a lot” of parenting duties while simultaneously teleworking. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Low-paid caregiving jobs bind together a lot of big trends happening in the economy, said Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. And you can see those themes play out in the lives of the women whose children used to ride to school on Roberta Steele’s bus — and now have no bus service at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Amanda Swanson, a neighbor of Kaidi’s, who spent the first months of school making a point of being first in the hour-long pickup line every day at Northport Elementary. She’s supporting her family working as a manager at an Amazon fulfillment center while her husband stays home with their youngest children because child care is too expensive. He used to be able to walk the children to the bus stop. But after the bus stopped running, Swanson switched to an overnight shift and frequently left her job early so she could drive them in the family’s only car. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" alt="Bus driver Roberta Steele waits for students" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p>Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Not long ago, Swanson (or her husband) would have been a prime candidate to <em>be</em> a school bus driver. Instead, she’s working a job that didn’t exist a decade ago but pays enough to keep her family solvent. It’s not just that school-support jobs don’t pay enough, it’s that they’re in direct competition for workers with jobs that pay more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At least since the 1970s, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wages for the majority of Americans have barely budged</a>, and if anything <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45090.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they've decreased for workers that don't have a college degree</a>,” said Krista Ruffini, a professor of economics at Georgetown University. Even before COVID-19, that squeeze is part of what has made jobs like bus driving less attractive today than they were 20 or 30 years ago, and it’s also put those jobs in competition with newer kinds of work — gig-economy jobs or delivery and warehouse jobs that require the same kinds of skills, pay the same or more, and require less emotional labor, Wozniak said. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="School bus drivers have other job options " aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SHk3V/13/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="410" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So far, these newer jobs are still a relatively small portion of all jobs and because of that probably can’t explain big, economy-wide trends. “But there will be some employers now who are competing with, basically, Amazon,” she said. A school bus driver could instead drive a delivery vehicle. School support staff like paraprofessionals and lunch ladies have logistics skills that are needed in a warehouse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when there’s a shortage of school bus drivers, that makes it hard for some parents to take a job. Once her children were finally old enough to be in school during the day, Kaidi had intended to go back to work this fall for the first time in years. But, she said, she’s received multiple job offers she couldn’t accept because of the time she has to spend ferrying her children to and from four different school buildings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Her conundrum makes it easy to understand how <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pandemic has disproportionately</a> affected <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/why-has-covid-19-been-especially-harmful-for-working-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women’s careers</a>. “On the female side of the labor market, we know that there's been an increase in people that say that they can't work because they're providing care,” Ruffini said. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some have had to quit</a>; others just don’t reenter the workforce, even when they have an opportunity. That’s been a feature of the pandemic, affecting a wide swath of the kinds of service and emotional-labor jobs that disproportionately employ women — jobs like the ones in schools. Kaidi’s experience shows how shortages in one field can create or exacerbate shortages in another. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, many of the women who have stayed in their emotional-labor jobs are being pushed to a breaking point — women like Swanson and Kaidi’s neighbor Christiana Metzger, a nursing assistant who works nights and has been running on almost no sleep since the beginning of the school year in September. She described breaking the speed limit, exhausted, trying to get home fast enough to take her older children to class on time, preparing meals and picking kids up from school and checking their homework, and the headache she’d had for several days straight. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The jobs done by people like Metzger are what middle-level jobs look like today, said Nicole Smith, chief economist at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Along with the lack of growth in real wages, there’s the idea that the job spectrum has hollowed out, leaving nothing but the worst-paying jobs and the ones that pay well but require college degrees. But that’s not exactly the case, Smith says. There are jobs left in the middle, but they’re no longer in manufacturing — they’re jobs that involve caring for people (like nurses) or supporting other workers (like school paraprofessionals). Again, women’s jobs. Jobs that continually conflict with women’s labor at home.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The emotional and psychological aspects of work are something economists are only just beginning to pay attention to, Wozniak said. But when shortages happen — whether through the cost-saving design of a lean staffing model or a chain of unfortunate events — it’s those intangible, immeasurable parts of a job that can quickly spiral out of control. “Now there are three people in the lunchroom instead of five or eight,” she said. “It’s the same job but not at all the same because you’re doing it faster and with less help.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bus driver shortage is a pay issue, but it’s also clearly more than that. It’s about how your job treats you. It’s about what you’re expected to do outside of the office. It’s about the narrow space women are squeezed into where we need to be better paid for the hard work we do at caregiving jobs but also need other women to do caregiving jobs at a lower price we can afford. It’s about being forced to make a choice between fulfilling your responsibilities at work and getting your children home safely. And it’s about how schools do, and don’t, function.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of October, Kaidi, Metzger and Swanson finally got bus service again. But they didn’t get it from Steele, who remains relegated to a different route, increasingly unhappy with the way the bus company and the district are treating her and other drivers. The immediate crisis ended for some of the moms of Brooklyn Center. But the problem isn’t solved. Not for the drivers. Not for the school districts suffering disruption on top of disruption. And not for the nation as a whole. “What’s going on in the labor market is something that we certainly haven’t seen in my lifetime,” Ruffini said. People have been out of work and out of their normal routines for a long time, she noted. Their responsibilities have changed at home. And so have the ways they spend their time and their resources. Nobody knows what happens next. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we do know that what happens with bus drivers is going to affect what happens with a lot of other people. The pandemic didn’t create these shortages. But it made clear how inextricably linked one job is to a whole bunch of others — how our lives and livelihoods are lashed together with cords we can’t usually see. When a time of stress and tragedy makes those invisible bonds more tangible, we can’t go back to pretending they don’t exist. All we can do is try to untangle them together. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">A sample size of two is never sufficient to get an accurate read of what’s happening in politics — let alone what <em>will</em> happen. But in the wake of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections last week</a>, that’s what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xSyf1wPN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everyone is trying to do</a>. Still, we’re almost exactly one year away from the 2022 midterm elections, so the temptation is understandable. So, what <em>can</em> last week’s results tell us about the 2022 midterm elections? And what <em>can’t</em> they tell us?</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Right </strong><strong><em>now</em></strong><strong>, the political environment is significantly more friendly to Republicans than it was in 2020</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the simplest, surest and maybe most important takeaway from the 2021 elections. As we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-virginias-and-new-jerseys-elections-could-suggest-a-red-wave-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote last week</a>, the electorates in both states shifted toward the GOP, leading to only about a 3-percentage-point reelection victory for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in fairly blue New Jersey and a 2-point win for Republican Glenn Youngkin in comparably purple Virginia, which marked the first statewide win for the Virginia GOP since 2009. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having looked through the results, we can be really confident that Republicans have an edge right now. And keeping in mind the historical tendency of the party holding the White House to face substantial headwinds in the subsequent midterm election, there’s plenty to suggest that Republicans could have a turnout edge in 2022 as the nonpresidential party. Speaking of …</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Turnout is likely to be supercharged in 2022 — especially among Republicans</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last Tuesday’s vote demonstrated that Republicans are strongly motivated to turnout. We can see that in the chart below, where the greater the Republican vote share was in a county or city, the better turnout was compared to the 2020 election. While turnout fell everywhere from last November (you’d expect that going from a presidential contest — the highest-profile election in the U.S. — to an off-year election), participation tended to decline less in places that voted more Republican.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1142" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skelley-VA-NJ-1111.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">History shows that this pattern is unsurprising considering there’s a Democratic president in office — and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular one at that</a>. All else being equal, we’d expect the average Republican to be more likely to show up right now than the average Democrat. This “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differential turnout</a>” will be an important factor in the 2022 midterms, although just how much of a turnout edge Republicans will end up having remains to be seen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the broader turnout picture also suggests that our era of high turnout elections seems likely to continue in 2022. Among the nation’s <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/faq/denominator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting-eligible population</a>, more Americans cast ballots in the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2018g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 midterms</a> (50 percent) and <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2020g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 presidential election</a> (67 percent) than in <a href="http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any midterm or presidential race</a> since the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting age was lowered</a> to 18 in 1971, according to the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Elections Project</a>. Yet while the 2017 elections in Virginia and New Jersey <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-it-time-for-republicans-to-panic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served as initial markers</a> of high voter engagement early in Donald Trump’s presidency, those contests actually had significantly lower turnout than what we saw this year. Compared with 2017, Virginia’s turnout jumped from about 43 percent to around 53 percent of the voting-eligible population, a modern record for the state, while New Jersey’s increased from around 36 percent to roughly 41 percent.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are estimates based on voting-eligible population data from the &lt;a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;United States Elections Project&lt;/a&gt;, which will not publish new population figures until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> This doesn’t guarantee that 2022 turnout will outpace the 2018 midterms, but it does portend that participation levels will still be quite high compared with pre-2018 midterms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, the results in Virginia and New Jersey should put paid to the idea that high turnout is a panacea for Democrats. New Jersey and Virginia lean Democratic as a default: According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric</a>, the Garden State is about 12 points more Democratic than the nation as a whole, while Virginia is D+5.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> As such, you might expect a higher turnout off-year election to come closer to falling in line with those partisan baselines. Yet with turnout up in both states from 2017, Republicans won in Virginia and fell just short in bluer New Jersey.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN: Democratic turnout may not be low in 2022, but matching Republicans will be tough</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, considering the high overall turnout, it’s apparent that Democrats also showed up at a relatively high rate in many places — just not quite to the same extent as Republicans. For instance, Fairfax County, Virginia’s most populous locality and one Biden <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51059&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried by 42 points</a> last year, saw its vote total decrease by about the same rate as raw turnout fell in Virginia overall from 2020 (down about 27 percent). But looking ahead to 2022, turnout figures carried warning signs regarding two groups who usually lean pretty strongly toward the Democrats: voters of color and young people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When it came to turnout and race in last Tuesday’s elections, places that were whiter tended to see higher turnout compared with the 2020 presidential race. For instance, in the cities and counties in New Jersey and Virginia that are majority nonwhite, turnout from 2020 fell by 39 percent, compared with a decline of 29 percent in places that were 80 percent white or more. Of course, given the swing toward the GOP in the 2021 elections and the tendency for more Republican-leaning places to see higher turnout, this isn’t surprising. After all, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/american-politics-now-has-two-big-racial-divides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race is one of the strongest predictors of partisan identity</a> — nationally, fewer than 1 in 5 Republicans are nonwhite, while about 2 in 5 Democrats are, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a 2019 Pew Research</a> study — so if GOP turnout was higher, we’d expect greater participation in whiter areas.</p>

</div>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, we see evidence that fewer young voters showed up to vote. Turnout dropped precipitously in college towns. Radford and Harrisonburg, small cities in western Virginia with sizable state universities,<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radford University and James Madison University, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> for instance, saw the ninth- and 10th-largest drops in turnout from 2020 across all 133 Virginia cities and counties. And while exit polls are imperfect, 18 to 29-year-olds made up <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2021/november/exit-polls/virginia/governor/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 10 percent of the electorate</a> in Virginia’s exit polls, a decline <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from their share in 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2017-election/va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely compared with 2017 as well</a>, both comparatively more Democratic environments than the current one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With all this being said, a disproportionate dropoff in turnout among voters of color and young voters in nonpresidential elections isn’t unusual. In midterm elections, the electorate has traditionally been whiter and older because a disproportionate number of voters who are young and/or from racial or ethnic minorities <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/how-midterms-do-and-do-not-differ-from-presidential-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to drop out of the electorate</a>. But because Democrats are more reliant on these voters as whites without a college degree — the largest part of the electorate — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-voters-without-a-degree-remained-staunchly-republican-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move toward the GOP</a>, it’s become more critical for Democrats to find ways to ameliorate this midterm turnout decline.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN’T: The 2021 elections signal a GOP swing in 2022 — but not how much of one</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">For all the strong reactions to the New Jersey and Virginia results, however, it’s worth pointing out that it’s entirely normal for those two states to swing away from the president’s party — hell, it would have been strange if they <em>hadn’t</em>. In all but one of the two states’ 16 total gubernatorial elections since 1993, the party in the White House has performed worse than it did the year before in the presidential election. The one exception wasn’t exactly a dramatic one either, as the GOP lost the 2001 New Jersey governor’s race by about 15 points one year after losing by 16 points in the 2000 presidential contest. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Virginia is a more competitive state at its baseline and has more regularly moved away from the president’s party, so observers tend to look at it as a potential indicator of <a href="https://twitter.com/algaraca/status/1455934093422702600?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future midterm results</a>. But for all the focus on Virginia, since the early 1990s it’s been an inconsistent predictor of the next midterm result. From 1993 to 2018, the average difference between the swing in Virginia’s gubernatorial election from the state’s partisan lean and the margin in the midterm national popular vote for the House of Representatives was just shy of 7 percentage points. That error margin — and remember, our sample of elections here is relatively small; there could be an even bigger difference in 2022 — represents the difference between a “meh” or even OK year for Democrats in 2022 and a complete wipeout in both the House and the Senate. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Simply put, the Virginia result can’t tell us exactly what the national House vote is going to look like next year. It gives us only a <em>rough</em> idea of how the political winds might blow as we head into the midterm year.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between that swing and the House vote margin since 1993 is .56, which suggests there’s a somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-interpret-a-correlation-coefficient-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;positive relationship&lt;/a&gt; between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That makes sense, as the factors that boosted Republicans in 2021, especially <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s poor approval rating</a>, could push voters toward them next year, too. Indeed, the scope of that rightward swing will depend greatly on Biden’s standing — if it improves between now and next fall, that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-in-congress-need-bidens-approval-rating-to-stay-in-the-mid-50s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could fend off some of the Democrats’ potential losses</a>; if it stays where it is or gets worse, Democrats could be looking at another 1994 or 2010, when their party took a thorough shellacking in the House and Senate.</p>



<h2><strong>CAN’T: How coalitions will shift in 2022</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another thing the Virginia and New Jersey races can’t tell us with certainty is just which parts of the two parties’ coalitions are actually sticking with them or shifting disproportionately toward the other party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, might white voters with a college degree stick with Democrats? The exit polls from Virginia suggest Democrats won a narrow majority among them, more or less the same as Biden performed in 2020.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit polls are always at least a little bit prone to error — they are still surveys, after all — but this was &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;especially true in the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; given how much of the electorate voted absentee. It’s likely this comparison isn’t apples-to-apples but it’s still a useful benchmark for understanding the shift among suburban voters in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> So it’s possible this group, which <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has trended toward Democrats</a> in recent years, will hold up for the party come 2022. At the same time, an analysis of county-level data in the Virginia and New Jersey races didn’t show much of a relationship between how much Republicans improved over their 2020 showing in a place and how much of the population is white with a college degree. In other words, if Democrats’s support among white voters with a college degree held steady, we might have expected those sorts of places to see comparatively smaller Republican gains, but instead there wasn’t much of a pattern in the data to suggest that happened. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And for all the talk of Democratic losses in the suburbs and rural areas, it’s worth noting that there was a relatively uniform swing toward the GOP across rural, suburban and more urban parts of both New Jersey and Virginia. Using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>,<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index is a measure of how densely populated a county or county-equivalent is based on the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> we categorized localities in both states into places that are more urban, suburban/exurban, or rural in nature, and found that while suburban and exurban places tended to move the most toward Republicans, the magnitude of those shifts were not all that different from urban and rural areas.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We categorized places with an index of 12 or more as urban, 10 to 12 as suburban or exurban, and below 10 as rural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

 <p>FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index, a calculation of how urban or rural a county is, is the natural logarithm of the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract in that county. Places with an index of 12 or more were categorized as urban, 10 to 12 as suburban or exurban, and below 10 as rural.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps if suburban areas had shifted even more markedly to the right while more urban places stayed in the Democratic camp, we could more convincingly claim that the suburbs in particular swung hard for the GOP. Or if rural areas had moved further to the right than other types of places, we could better make the case that it was rural areas that cost Democrats in Virginia. But the lack of more sizable variations across types of place leaves us with a less obvious conclusion about the role of population density, at least beyond “the environment was good for Republicans.” Although, obviously, if the swings are like this in November 2022, that’ll be all the GOP needs to capture the House and Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lastly, we got little clarity on whether Hispanics continued to notably shift toward the GOP after moving to the right in 2020. The exit polls found that Democrat Terry McAuliffe won about two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, which didn’t differ that much from Biden’s showing in 2020. However, the <a href="https://interactives.ap.org/votecast-2021-va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press’s VoteCast</a> caused a stir when it reported that Youngkin had actually carried Latino voters. The truth might lie somewhere in between, but fundamentally, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US,VA/PST045219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only about 10 percent of Virginia’s population</a> is Hispanic, so we also know the sample sizes of <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_m_rob/status/1456014764103065600?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanics were not especially large in either survey</a>, which produces results that have a larger margin of error. And just to add to the confusion, consider some of the actual vote totals. On the one hand, after taking into account the overall swing toward the GOP, McAuliffe didn’t do exceedingly worse than previous Democratic statewide candidates in a handful of majority Hispanic precincts in <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/the-future-of-vote-tabulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairfax County</a>, and the only place where Murphy more or less matched Biden’s margin was Hudson County (Jersey City), which is 40 percent Hispanic. At the same time, Murphy lost about the same amount of margin in Passaic County, which is 42 percent Hispanic, as he did statewide compared to Biden (14.5 points vs. about 13 points). There’s just not a clear picture.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>

<p data-paragraph="main">The results out of New Jersey and Virginia signal that the electoral environment is clearly favorable to Republicans right now, although it can’t tell us just how pro-GOP it’ll be in a year’s time. There’s little question that Republican voters are energized and motivated to turn out to a greater extent than Democratic ones, and Democrats do have to worry about turning out important parts of their base, like young voters and voters of color. But the New Jersey and Virginia contests failed to really tell us just how certain demographic groups might vote next year, or whether they’re continuing to trend toward or away from either party. Part of that is down to having just two major elections to go off of. But it’s also down to a mixed bag of data that offers somewhat contradictory conclusions.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Can white voters who back a Black candidate still hold racist beliefs and views?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That question has come to the fore in the wake of Glenn Youngkin’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gubernatorial victory in the blueish state of Virginia</a>. Conservatives were quick to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/progressives-cry-racism-to-excuse-democratic-losses-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter claims</a> that Youngkin’s win <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/republicans-critical-race-theory-winning-electoral-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented the effectiveness of stoking racial fears</a> with results from Virginia’s down-ballot election for lieutenant governor — a contest where the Republican candidate, Winsome Sears, made history by becoming the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia. The Wall Street Journal’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/virginia-governor-election-glenn-youngkin-race-11635979212" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editorial board</a>, for example, emphatically mocked the notion that “voters called white supremacists elected a Black Lt. Gov.” Conservative commentators on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-five-media-glenn-youngkin-winsome-sears-virginia-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News and Twitter</a>, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jemele-hill-roasted-for-tweet-alleging-this-country-simply-loves-white-supremacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sears herself</a>, also used the historic victory as an ostensible shield against accusations of Republican racism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But supporting a Black candidate hardly precludes voters from harboring racist beliefs and motivations. Republicans are <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196435/identity-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly more likely than Democrats</a> to hold prejudiced views of minorities, so Black Republicans like Sears often draw especially strong support from white Americans with otherwise anti-Black views simply because they draw most of their support from Republican voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A clear example of this was in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, when Ben Carson made a bid to become the GOP’s first African American presidential nominee. Support for Carson was positively correlated with the belief that Black Americans have too much influence on U.S. politics, according to data from <a href="https://wc.wustl.edu/taps-data-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington University in St. Louis’s American Panel Survey (TAPS)</a> in late 2015:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1194" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-1-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Whites who thought African Americans had “far too little” influence disliked Carson and preferred Hillary Clinton by 60 percentage points in a hypothetical general election matchup. Meanwhile, Carson was very popular among whites who were most concerned about African Americans having “too much” influence in politics. So much so that whites who thought African Americans have “far too much” influence preferred Carson to Clinton by 45 points.   </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, much of that relationship is down to partisanship — Republicans are more likely to hold prejudiced views and also more likely to support a Republican candidate. But that’s the point: For many white GOP voters, anti-Black views don’t seem to get in the way of supporting a Black Republican.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can see a similar pattern in the January <a href="https://electionstudies.org/data-center/anes-2016-pilot-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 American National Election Studies Pilot Study</a>. Carson received more favorable evaluations among the sizable minority (40 percent) of overtly prejudiced whites who agreed with the racist stereotype that “most African Americans are more violent than most whites.” This group rated Carson significantly more favorably on a 0-100 scale than the white moderate Republican presidential candidate, Jeb Bush (52 to 39, respectively). Then-candidate Donald Trump was the only politician in the survey who was rated higher than Carson among overtly prejudiced whites.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicians evaluated in the 2016 ANES Pilot Study were: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a>                </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1002" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jefferson-tesler.BLACK-CANDIDATES.1110-2-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The contrast between how prejudiced whites rated Carson and Obama is rather revealing, as well. The sharp negative relationship between support for Obama and the endorsement of anti-Black stereotypes is consistent with <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300175196/end-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo10443910.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/s0022381612000904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00564.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9108-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prejudice</a> was an <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41319767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unusually strong</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272714000929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictor</a> of opposition to Obama from the 2008 election <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the end of his presidency</a>. These patterns also fit well with <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2749510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/changing-white-attitudes-toward-black-political-leadership/D118208EC01BDF5B0FF0A99C92D3BA2E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political science</a> <a href="http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/06/8_-_Ansolabehere_-_68_Stan._L._Rev.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> showing that racially prejudiced whites tend to be more opposed to Black Democrats than to white Democrats.          </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To make sense of why racially prejudiced white Americans are willing to support some Black candidates, it is worth considering why they so strongly oppose Black Democrats in the first place. Given the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691153889/racial-realignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racialized nature of the two-party system</a> in the United States, most Black political candidates are Democrats who embrace liberal positions on issues of race and justice. When asked whether they would support such a candidate, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/voting-hopes-or-fears-9780195101621?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows</a> that racially prejudiced white voters worry that these candidates will represent the interests of Black Americans, both because of a shared African American identity  and because Democrats are <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196435/identity-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived as the party more supportive of Black interests</a>. So, it makes sense that racially resentful white Americans oppose candidates like Obama, as his racial identity <em>and</em> partisanship signaled to voters that he was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more supportive of Black interests</a> than prior presidents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put another way: Racially prejudiced white voters are not opposed to Black candidates simply because they are Black, but because they believe that most Black candidates will fight for “those people” and not “people like us.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black Republicans, on the other hand, are <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/70/2/139/1912448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived differently</a> by racially prejudiced white Americans. Their embrace of the Republican Party and its conservative ideology help assure racially prejudiced whites that, unlike Black Democrats, they are not in the business of carrying water for their own racial group. Instead, they are viewed as distinct from other Black elites. If Blackness is viewed as intertwined with a kind of racial liberalism that is antagonistic to the interests of white Americans, Black Republicans’ partisan and ideological commitments allay concerns that they are for “them,” not “us.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This argument is buttressed by more <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/708952?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent scholarship</a> in political science, which has found that Black candidates who embrace a “bootstrap” ideology — an ideology that focuses on individual versus structural explanations of inequality — are more positively evaluated by racially prejudiced whites relative to their white competitors. Explaining this finding, the authors note that racially prejudiced white voters “might find black Republicans delivering an individualism message more favorable than they might find other candidates delivering a similar message precisely because the aesthetic character and the partisan affiliation of the messenger contradict racial and political expectations.” LaFleur Stephens-Dougan, a professor of political science at Princeton University, similarly shows in her book “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo50271574.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Race to the Bottom</a>” that racially resentful whites respond well to Black candidates who take stances against the expected positions of their racial group — a phenomenon she calls “<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/11/how-politicians-practice-racial-distancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial distancing</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, voting for Black Republicans may also be especially appealing to racially prejudiced whites because it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-politics-of-white-liberals-and-white-conservatives-are-shaped-by-whiteness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assuages concerns of being seen as racist</a> by enabling them to say, in essence, “I can’t be racist! I voted for a Black candidate!” Psychologists call this “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167210385920?casa_token=ZYs_NQsQ6UUAAAAA:cYTNozXMv1BaxUXXgOFltZuDZbaMbQDoQ45nK4DO8O1RR3iuzEtNjEBlTDK5SI9Ztd7x9JYXZFKsjg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moral credentialing</a>,” and there’s even <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/march4/obama-moral-credentials-favor-whites-030409.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some evidence</a> that voters who expressed support for Obama shortly after the 2008 election felt more justified in favoring white Americans over Black Americans. Electing a Black Republican like Sears, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/virginia-republican-winsome-sears-critical-race-theory-nonsense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">railed against critical race theory</a> during the run-up to the election and <a href="https://twitter.com/winsomesears/status/1372941065007816705?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports voting restrictions</a> that <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voter-suppression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adversely affect racial minorities</a>, is similarly used as a symbolic shield by the entire party from inevitable charges of championing racist policies. As we mentioned earlier, conservative media outlets and politicians are already weaponizing her victory against anyone who would dare suggest so.    </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, the role race and racism play in American politics is much more nuanced than those simplistic defenses suggest. When racially prejudiced whites oppose Black candidates, it’s not just because of the candidate’s skin color. It’s also because they perceive (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3791741.pdf?casa_token=uYKOesmYykcAAAAA:d-YnnVbpIrcuvW4LXifNINvlzmidnOyOxQTynx6PA_gCzCM6mTgTsKU5yeFrYkwWdm1L-cw0WCe0ZpC-6v1hvBAvigo5Du16GgvF0TcyZevRA9wrRw_C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes wrongly</a>) that Black candidates, especially Black Democrats, have ideological commitments that are at odds with the interests of white Americans. Likewise, when racially prejudiced whites support Black Republicans, it’s hardly the case that they’ve become progressive on race. Racially prejudiced whites did not vote for Sears because they appreciated her attachment and commitment to Black people. They were willing to support her because they discounted it. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Race, after all, is a social construct. It has meaning because we imbue it with meaning. Racially prejudiced whites are not hostile to Blackness, per se. They are hostile to a particular manifestation of Blackness — one that reflects a commitment to racial justice and the advancement of the group’s collective goals. Racially prejudiced whites are not bothered much by a manifestation of Blackness that is ideologically consistent with their own identities and attitudes. Why would they be? Sears’s conservative politics don’t threaten the racial hierarchy, and her candidacy provides cover for a party that’s often antagonistic to racial minorities. For racially prejudiced whites, the real question is what is there <em>not</em> to love about Black politicians like Sears?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">After an excruciating wait for many families, children ages 5 and older can now be vaccinated against COVID-19. The decision marks a turning point in the pandemic for millions of Americans as they can worry a little less and live a little more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For more than a year and a half we’ve been told that the worries of adults have changed the lives of kids in all sorts of deleterious ways. And so, on the eve of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s decision to approve vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds, we wanted to know just how kids (and their parents) were doing. Are kids and teenagers stressed, depressed and scared? How do they see themselves and their families changed by the pandemic? And how has their behavior changed to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in their daily life? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To help answer those questions, we partnered with <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our friends at Ipsos</a>, the polling firm, to work on a poll that asked parents and kids how they’re doing. Between Oct. 25 and Nov. 2, FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos used Ipsos’ KnowledgePanel to survey 689 kids ages 5 to 11, 572 kids ages 12 to 17 (let’s call them “teens” for our purposes), and more than 1,500 of their parents.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We began by surveying a representative sample of parents with children under 18 in the household. After they completed the survey, we randomly selected a child 5 to 17 (if applicable) and asked if their selected child was available and would consent to take a short survey. For the 5- to 11-year-olds, we directed the parent to ask the child the questions and record the answers. For the 12- to 17-year-olds, we asked the parent to have the teen complete the survey. Parents and kids alike could take the survey on a computer, tablet or mobile phone, in English or in Spanish. Each surveyed population (adults, teens and children) received its own weighting, based on benchmarks from the 2019 American Community Survey and 2021 March Supplement of the Current Population Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> The answers were surprising! We found a population of kids who appear to be pretty resilient, even in the face of loneliness and isolation, and who are forming strong relationships with their parents and families. Any one kid who’s struggling because of the pandemic is a source of concern. Overall, though, America’s kids aren’t as downtrodden as they’re often made out to be. </p>

These were our highlights:</p>



<h2><strong><strong>Parents are concerned about their kids, but kids are having a pretty good time</strong></strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The kids are all right — or, at least, they report being a lot more all right than we were expecting. The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed the lives of children and teens, cutting them off from friends, activities and adults other than their parents. The combination of limited social contact, disrupted schooling and fear of the virus itself <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-04/childrens-mental-health-crisis-could-be-a-next-wave-in-the-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led many to anticipate</a> a major mental health crisis looming in youth. A poll conducted this past spring by the Children’s Hospital of Chicago found <a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/blog/childrens-mental-health-pandemic-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65 percent of parents believed the mental health consequences for kids will be worse</a> than for adults. So we were surprised to find that the kids who participated in our survey almost universally don’t describe themselves as struggling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, we asked teens, ages 12 to 17, about the current state of their mental health and a vast majority had good things to say.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, their parents were a little more likely to report poor mental health — 11 percent of parents to 8 percent of the teens. FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos asked kids aged 5 to 11 a slightly different question — “How do you feel right now?” — and 96 percent of them said they felt very or somewhat good. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That’s great. It’s really good news,” said Anna Gassman-Pines, a professor of psychology and public policy at Duke University, when we told her the results of the survey. “There’s a lot of good developmental science behind the idea that ultimately kids will be resilient.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The good vibes extended to more specific parts of their lives, too. Overall, teens were less likely than their parents to be worried about their ability to perform in school, less worried about their ability to participate in activities, less worried about catching COVID-19, and much less worried about their mental health. While 34 percent of parents were concerned about their kids’ mental health, about half as many teens — 18 percent — found their own mental health concerning. More than half said their mental health hadn’t changed at all since the start of the pandemic — 24 percent said it had gotten worse and 20 percent said their mental health was now better. </p>

Twenty-seven percent of teens reported that the pandemic led to improvements in their home lives and 30 percent reported having better relationships with their parent(s). And more than 90 percent of kids of all ages felt that their parents had done a good job keeping them safe during the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gassman-Pines’s <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/display/pub1454300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own research has focused on the impacts COVID-19 had on low-income families</a>, and particularly the families of people who worked in the service industry during the pandemic. She was pleasantly surprised to find that the good news remained largely good even when we broke our respondents down by income and race. There were some differences, though. Black parents were more likely than white parents to report that they were concerned about their personal finances, and low-income parents reported worse finances and physical health than higher-income parents. And teens and children of color were more scared of COVID-19 and of being lonely. But the shares of teens who felt good about their home lives, relationship with parents, mental and physical health, and current loneliness were mostly consistent across race and income.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey asked respondents about race and ethnicity, so white includes only non-Hispanic white respondents, and Black non-Hispanic Black respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> Even when parents were having a harder time, and kids were more worried, the outcomes for those kids weren’t particularly worse. It’s possible, Gassman-Pines said, that this is an indicator of the positive, stabilizing impacts of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/politics/stimulus-checks-economic-hardship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimulus</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/28/child-tax-credit-permanent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">child tax credit</a> payments — something that’s been observed in other research.  </p>



<h2><strong>Kids<strong> say they’re living in a world trying to keep them safe from COVID-19</strong></strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">We were also surprised to see high rates of reported mask usage and other behaviors to keep people safe from COVID-19. Eighty percent of teens and younger kids reported that their teachers were consistently or always wearing masks at school, 70 percent of both groups reported that their friends were consistently doing the same, and more than 70 percent said other kids at school were. The kids and teens in our survey also reported that they, themselves, were mask wearing at rates higher than 70 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Predictably, there were geographic differences in this data. Teens in the Northeast were most likely to say their teachers always wear masks — more than 75 percent of them. Those rates were less than 50 percent in the Midwest and South. This tracks with regulations. Schools in the Northeast have been <a href="https://districtadministration.com/track-school-mask-rules-requirements-state-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to implement and maintain masking mandates</a> than schools in the South. Cases of COVID-19 in children have followed the same patterns, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographicsovertime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with higher rates in the Southeast and South</a> than in the Northeast. </p>

White kids were more likely to report having indoor playdates in the last month — a particularly interesting result given that white kids were also the ones least likely to be worried about contracting COVID-19 themselves. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1062" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/koerth-COVID-KIDS-POLL-1110-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2><strong>Kids’ relationships with their friends are relatively worse off</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">While kids and teens have generally positive things to report about their overall mental health and their relationships at home, the pandemic does seem to have had an impact on how young people interact with each other and how they feel about those changes. Indoor activities are still not the norm for most kids. Fewer than 50 percent of both teens and younger children had had an indoor playdate in the last month; fewer than 40 percent had attended an indoor party; and only 41 percent of teens and 31 percent of younger children had attended an indoor club meeting or played sports inside. In contrast, 64 percent of teens and 77 percent of younger kids had played with their friends outside, an activity that is significantly less likely to lead to COVID-19 transmission. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">And we see some big contrasts in how kids and teens think about their friends versus their family. While 30 percent of teens reported improved relationships with parents since COVID-19 began and only 7 percent reported those relationships worsening, the changes in relationships with friends were a lot more split, with 27 percent reporting that their friendships and social lives had gotten better and 29 percent reporting they had gotten worse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, 26 percent of teens reported feeling less connected and more lonely since the start of the pandemic, while 25 percent reported feeling more connected and less lonely. While the raw numbers were small, we did see correlations that connected a strong sense of feeling lonely to a sense that one’s mental health had gotten worse. </p>



<h2>Families generally agree on vaccines</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Parents have spent a lot more time talking about the vaccine to other adults than teens have spent discussing it with their peers — 50 percent to 38 percent. But that doesn’t mean the teens haven’t formed opinions on the vaccine and how it should be rolled out. Those opinions tend to track with the opinions of their parents. For example, 60 percent of parents and 61 percent of teens agreed that schools should mandate vaccines for adults in schools, including teachers and administrators. And a smaller majority agreed that schools should mandate vaccines for students 12 and older: 54 percent of parents and 57 percent of teens. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">About 50 percent of parents in the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll were interested in vaccinating their under-12 children, depending on the age of the child, and between 50 and 60 percent of the teens we interviewed had already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. (The survey was conducted before the CDC approved vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds.) </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1236426850-575.jpg" alt='A child in a Captain America costume displays a sticker reading "COVID-19 Vaccinated"' data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1236426850-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1236426850-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1236426850-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>About half of the parents of 5- to 11-year-olds in the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll said they were interested in vaccinating their kids, and that was before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved vaccination for that age group. <p>Hannah Beier / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">We found strong correlations between parents’ attitudes about personal vaccination and the attitudes of their children. If you focus just on teens whose parents had already gotten vaccinated or were very likely to, 79 percent of them said they were already vaccinated or were very likely to be soon — compared to just 9 percent of teens whose parents weren’t vaccinated and weren’t likely to be. We found similar patterns with younger kids: 46 percent of those whose parents were vaccinated said they were (or were going to be soon), compared to just 1 percent of kids whose parents weren’t vaccinated and weren’t likely to be. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Teens’ and kids’ attitudes about whether they should get the vaccine themselves were also highly correlated with parents’ attitudes. Among teens and kids who were unlikely to get vaccinated, parent opinions mattered significantly more than whether peers were getting vaccinated or not. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, to summarize, kids are relatively happy and listening to their parents. Just as we always assumed. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">After considering at least 11 proposals, the North Carolina General Assembly finally <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/politics/2021/11/04/redistricting-in-n-c---new-maps-approved--favoring-gop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a new congressional map</a> on Nov. 4 — and it’s one of the most Republican-biased maps they could have chosen. But this likely isn’t the end of the redistricting saga in the Tar Heel State. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting is usually a once-a-decade process, but in North Carolina, courts have repeatedly ordered the drawing of new congressional maps due to extreme gerrymandering. And given that both racial and partisan gerrymandering <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article255621116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits have already been filed</a> against this new map, it remains to be seen whether it will survive either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">North Carolina’s previous congressional map — which is to say, the one used in last year’s election — already gave <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/north-carolinas-new-house-map-hands-democrats-two-seats-but-it-still-leans-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans eight seats and Democrats five seats</a> in a state President Biden lost by just 1 percentage point, but the new map gives the GOP an even greater advantage. According to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our analysis</a>, it creates 10 Republican seats, three Democratic seats and one highly competitive seat.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1796" height="1248" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-12.34.55-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The approved map has an efficiency gap of R+20.1, up 11.6 points from the old map, which had an efficiency gap of R+8.5. (<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Efficiency gap</a> is a measure of which party has more “wasted” votes, i.e., votes that don’t contribute toward a candidate winning. This means that the new map is more than twice as efficient for Republicans as the old map, which was already pretty efficient for them.) Under the new map, North Carolina’s median congressional district is also now 11.4 points redder than the state as a whole. In other words, Democrats would have to win North Carolina by 11.4 points just to win half its congressional seats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The new map boosts Republicans in the state through reapportionment, both by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving the state a 14th district, which the Republican-majority General Assembly used to give their party a double-digit advantage,</a> and by making two currently Democratic-held seats much less blue. One of those seats is the 6th District, which previously encompassed all of Guilford County and part of Forsyth County. The new map splits the old 6th into four districts, which contradicts House Redistricting Committee Chair Destin Hall’s <a href="https://repdestinhall.com/2021/11/04/north-carolina-house-passes-2021-redistricting-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> that the committee “focused only on traditional criteria like keeping counties and cities whole” when drawing maps. This change will surely make for an improbable reelection for Democratic Rep. Kathy Manning. In the new map, Manning represents the new 11th District, which leans Republican by 16 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other Democratic seat the new map undermines is Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield’s 1st District, which is now numbered the 2nd District in the approved map. Butterfield’s district goes from leaning Democratic by 7 points to leaning Democratic by just 1 point.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t the first time North Carolina has drawn maps that favor one group over others. During the 2010s, the state had two maps thrown out in court due to racial and partisan gerrymandering. Following the initial map in 2011, the courts ruled in 2016 that the state’s map had been racially gerrymandered to disadvantage Black voters in the state, a decision that was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upheld by the Supreme Court</a>. Then, in 2019, a state court panel threw out North Carolina’s 2016 map because it was ruled <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/north-carolina-judges-toss-maps-slam-gerrymandering-stinging-ruling-n1049411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partisan gerrymander</a> that gave Republicans an advantage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This time around, likely in an attempt to <a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2021-08-12/nc-lawmakers-adopt-criteria-for-next-round-of-redistricting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insulate themselves from more gerrymandering lawsuits</a>, legislative map-drawers <a href="https://ncleg.gov/documentsites/committees/Senate2021-154/2021/08-09-2021/2021%20Joint%20Redistricting%20Committee%20Plan%20Proposed%20Criteria.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced their redistricting criteria</a> in advance, which included adhering to the 2019 court’s decree that they not use partisan or racial data when crafting the new maps. But as we’ve seen, the 2021 congressional map gives Republicans an even greater advantage than before. And by omitting racial data, lawmakers may be running afoul of the <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/what-is-redistricting/redistricting-criteria-the-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voting Rights Act</a>, which requires states to draw heavily nonwhite districts in areas where there is racially polarized voting so that those communities have a voice in Congress. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Specifically, the new map could imperil the ability of Black residents in the new 2nd District (Butterfield’s district) to elect the representative of their choice. The new district has a voting-age population that is just 38 percent Black — down from 41 percent under the old map. It’s also 51 percent white, which is up from 48 percent. While this may appear to be a small difference, it’s enough to change the district from one that would likely elect a Democrat to one that could easily elect a Republican instead. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Legal challenges to the state’s new map have already begun. Considering the partisan skew of the map and its possible Voting Rights Act violations, the 2021 map could join last decade’s maps and get thrown out by the courts.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before the map was approved, the North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause and state residents <a href="https://southerncoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NC-NAACP-v.-Berger-Complaint-10.29.2021-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> arguing that the new map disenfranchises voters of color precisely <em>because</em> lawmakers decided not to consider racial data when drawing it. The lawsuit argues that the legislature must consider racial data to ensure that voters of color can elect their candidate of choice. For their part, Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article255621116.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say there is a precedent for not using racial data</a>: The 2019 map was approved without using it.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/exit-polls-explain-voters-vote-81047251</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The map also <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e909f4422f7a40a188de597/t/61859e7b8789a02515e620e2/1636146812238/2021.11.05+Supplemental+Complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces a lawsuit</a> on the grounds that it is a partisan gerrymander. The suit’s plaintiffs, who have regularly voted for Democrats, argue that the new map packs Democrats into districts like the Charlotte-area 9th District (to waste as many Democratic votes as possible) and cracks other Democratic strongholds like the Piedmont Triad (Manning’s current district) to minimize their voting power. Although <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/731847977/supreme-court-rules-partisan-gerrymandering-is-beyond-the-reach-of-federal-court?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court has ruled</a> (in a case concerning North Carolina) that partisan gerrymandering is a political question <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside the purview of federal courts</a>, this lawsuit will be decided by state courts, many of which have not been shy about striking down maps for reasons of partisan gerrymandering — including in North Carolina in 2019. And since Democrats currently hold a 4-3 majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court, this lawsuit may find a receptive audience.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It remains to be seen if the courts will overturn North Carolina’s new map, but the legal fight over them could further erode North Carolinians’ trust in the redistricting process. Both in the Tar Heel State and nationwide, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-trust-their-congressional-maps-to-be-drawn-fairly-can-anything-change-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voters view gerrymandering as a serious problem</a> and are skeptical that their maps will be fair due to the partisan nature of the process. Based on North Carolina’s new map, that skepticism appears well-founded.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nearly a week after Virginia’s and New Jersey’s elections, Democrats are still debating what went wrong for them. Pundits have given lots of hot takes on why Democrats did so poorly and what it portends for the 2022 midterms. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politics podcast</a>, the FiveThirtyEight crew runs down a list of theories in a game of Buy, Sell or Hold to discuss what evidence, if any, supports some of these arguments. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also debate how reliable exit polls are in determining what motivates voters and consider how Democrats were able to overcome intraparty disagreements to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/us/politics/infrastructure-black-caucus-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill</a>.</p>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In a break with Virginia’s recent electoral history, Republican Glenn Youngkin bested Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the state’s highly contentious governor’s race on Tuesday. Polls going into election night <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the two neck-and-neck</a>, but given McAuliffe had led the race until about a week before the election, it was still largely viewed as McAuliffe’s to lose — especially since Virginia Republicans had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/us/elections/youngkin-wins-virginia-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not won a statewide race since 2009</a> and Biden carried the state by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 percentage points last year</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So who powered Youngkin’s win? Well, he overperformed across the state, but exit polling data shows he did especially well among certain voting blocs — like white voters (both men and women) and voters without a college degree — which gave his campaign a boost. But one of the biggest factors for Youngkin might have been his strong showing among suburban voters. According to exit poll data, Youngkin won 53 percent of these voters across the state, which is roughly the opposite of what happened in 2020, when exit polls suggest President Joe Biden carried voters in those areas with a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrat-mcauliffe-facing-52-unfavorable-numbers-va-governor/story?id=80935662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar share of the vote</a>.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit polls are always at least a little bit prone to error &amp;#8212; they are still surveys, after all &amp;#8212; but this was &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;especially true in the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; given how much of the electorate voted absentee. It’s likely this comparison isn’t apples-to-apples but it’s still a useful benchmark for understanding the shift among suburban voters in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, we identified three main throughlines that we think are useful at this stage when discussing Youngkin’s upset: </p>



<ul><li>First and foremost, this is a story about suburban voters, who, on average, moved to the right. That is, as we suggested, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/">a departure from what we observed nationally</a> in the 2020 presidential election.</li><li>Education issues that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/11/03/school-board-races-show-mixed-results-critical-race-theory/6271364001/">dominated much</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/politics-policy/irony-ban-beloved-virginia-can-found-pages-book-rcna4081">of the lead-up to</a> Tuesday’s race were significant for understanding how voters felt about the candidates, but it’s actually really hard to isolate the role education played in the race.</li><li>Rather, disappointment in — or opposition to — Biden’s presidency may have been the main driver of this outcome, as is often the case in off-year Virginia elections.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s assess these one at a time: For starters, we (Geoffrey) <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote earlier this week</a> that the big reason Youngkin was successful was his strength in the suburban areas of the state where former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/trump-broke-suburbs-gop-virginia-516412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously struggled</a>. That’s especially true in Loudoun County, one of the most populous suburban enclaves in the commonwealth. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Virginia's suburbs swung towards Youngkin" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Skxj/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="478" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In Loudoun, McAuliffe underperformed relative to his party’s performance in 2020 while Youngkin overperformed: Although McAuliffe carried the county by 11 points, that marked a huge departure from Biden’s 25-point edge there last year. But Youngkin’s improved showing came across much of northern Virginia near Washington, D.C. (including Loudoun) as well as in predominantly suburban and exurban localities like Virginia Beach and Chesapeake in the southeastern corner of the state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In unpacking <em>why</em> Youngkin made inroads in the suburbs, though, things get more challenging. From the beginning, Youngkin straddled being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/trump-republican-governor-race-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-Trump but not so Trumpy</a> that he repelled suburban voters and white women (groups Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/upshot/election-polling-trump-women.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famously struggled with</a>). And because much of the previous suburban shift toward Democrats appears to have been driven by disdain for Trump, it’s now unclear that these gains will hold when Trump is off the ballot. It didn’t hurt that Youngkin, clad in a fleece vest most of the campaign, was able to posit himself as the spitting image of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/elections/glenn-youngkin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genial suburban dad</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, though, it doesn’t look like white college-educated voters, often <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/27/895867508/2020-suburban-voters-who-are-they" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately associated with the suburbs</a>, necessarily drove Youngkin’s victory. The polarization of white voters by educational attainment <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been a developing trend</a> in recent years, and the Virginia result shows an even more substantial split, thanks mainly to Youngkin gaining among white voters without a college degree. Remember, <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=&amp;t=Educational%20Attainment%3ARace%20and%20Ethnicity&amp;g=0400000US51%240500000&amp;y=2019&amp;tid=ACSDT1Y2019.B15002H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of white voters</a> without a four-year degree live in suburban places, too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, McAuliffe still narrowly edged Youngkin among white voters with a college degree; in fact, his margin <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t much different from Biden’s</a> in Virginia last November. By contrast, there wasn’t really much indication of an education gap among voters of color. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, while education-related issues — whether it was critical race theory or related to the pandemic — did seem to have had some effect on Tuesday’s results, it doesn’t seem like they alone influenced voters enough to push Youngkin over the edge. That doesn’t mean Youngkin didn’t make a concerted effort to appeal to parents, though. Throughout his campaign, he made subtle and not-so-subtle <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/virginia-governor-youngkin-education-gop-516625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeals to them by preying on fears</a> around things like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/us/politics/beloved-toni-morrison-virginia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taught in the classroom</a>. It wasn’t just the question of how race should be discussed in schools either. Youngkin also made appeals to parents fed up with more than a year of remote learning and other COVID-19-related school policies, like <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/who-is-glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-policies-beliefs/2866115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring masks in schools</a>. But all of this falls under the category of “education,” which makes it incredibly hard to disentangle which issue had a bigger impact on voters. And as we’ll discuss below, it’s not clear that education was even the most important factor for voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While roughly 59 percent of men with children under the age of 18 living in their home, for instance, supported Youngkin over McAuliffe, a majority of women with children (53 percent) backed McAuliffe. Similarly, a majority of men without children (56 percent) backed Youngkin, while women without children (54 percent) backed McAuliffe. In other words, men voted similarly regardless of their parental status, as did women.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these numbers could be explained in part by the simple fact that men tend to vote Republican, while women, on average, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to vote Democratic</a>. But the gender gap among parents here is notable because it makes it more difficult to pinpoint what education issues were the most salient to voters. Also, it’s possible that “nonparents,” by the exit poll’s definition, included a lot of younger and older voters who might have canceled each other out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if parental status wasn’t the most important thing in unpacking how voters voted on Tuesday, we shouldn’t discount the role education played in Tuesday’s race. Exit polling found that voters who believe parents should have “a lot” of say in what their child’s school teaches overwhelmingly supported Youngkin over McAuliffe (77 percent to 22 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other issues were also top of mind for voters, though. Polls ahead of Tuesday show that the <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginia-voters-economy-top-issue-when-voting-in-2021-election/65-29347cb5-a4b0-48bf-8c4b-180f4f33d48d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy topped voters’ list</a> of concerns. According to exit polling data, Youngkin won those voters, who were one-third of the respondents, with 55 percent of the vote compared to McAuliffe’s 44 percent. Youngkin also edged McAuliffe among the 8 percent of voters who named abortion as the top issue in the commonwealth: 58 percent to 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it really does seem like disappointment with Biden’s presidency is what ultimately drove support for Youngkin. Not only does <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-campaigns-virginia-election-2020-terry-mcauliffe-180e2815215619c97a931355f4cf6876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting already suggest</a> that some people who supported Biden last year <a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/11/03/republicans-bucked-virginias-blue-state-trend-here-are-a-few-reasons-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t vote in Virginia’s election</a>, but those who disapprove of Biden made up a majority of voters and voted overwhelmingly for Youngkin. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, 59 percent of voters who said they “somewhat” disapproved of the way Biden is handling his job as president and 96 percent who “strongly” disapproved backed Youngkin. Moreover, almost twice the share of people who had an unfavorable view of Trump backed Youngkin (17 percent) than the share who disapproved of Biden and backed McAuliffe (10 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, as with any election, it’s really hard to disentangle whether macro trends (Biden’s approval) versus local factors (education and the economy) had the biggest impact on the shifts toward the GOP. But they are related, and if Democrats want to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/joe-biden-plan-midterms-shellacking-458316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid a midterm shellacking</a> next year, they might want to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/opinion/virginia-election-democratic-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritize some of these</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/03/1051713890/election-analysis-virginia-new-jersey-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more local issues</a> that at least Virginians demonstrated could be important.</p>

This is up 11 points from when AP-NORC last asked this question in September. But Americans are split on whether the economy will improve: 30 percent of adults said they expected the economy to improve next year while 47 percent said they thought it will get worse.</li><li>In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/02/cop26-climate-summit-live-updates/">Biden’s closing remarks</a> on Tuesday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, he pointed to Democrats’ spending bill as America’s contribution to the fight against climate change. Only one problem: Congress is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/house-reconciliation-package-explainer/index.html">still debating</a> what will be in the bill. On climate specifically, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html">a number of key provisions have already been cut</a>, with some items, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/democrats-update-reconciliation-bill-as-they-prepare-to-vote/">like a fee on methane emissions</a>, still being ironed out. But per a Morning Consult poll taken last month, voters have started to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/28/climate-politics-biden-approval/">doubt Biden’s ability</a> to deliver on his campaign promise of sweeping climate legislation. Just 48 percent of registered voters said they approved of Biden’s handling of climate change, with 31 percent saying they somewhat approved and 17 percent saying they strongly approved.</li><li>Overall, though, Americans <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-not-yet-sold-build-back-better">aren’t following Democrats’ spending bill or the bipartisan infrastructure bill</a> <em>too</em> closely. An <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-not-yet-sold-build-back-better">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> taken Oct. 29-30 found that a plurality of Americans, 44 percent, only knew “just some” of what might be in the bills. This is understandable given that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-democrats-adding-paid-family-leave-back-social/story?id=80950206">what’s in the bill is still changing</a>, but almost half of respondents, 45 percent, said they weren’t following negotiations carefully. </li><li>Americans increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/#part3">don’t trust their own political institutions</a>, and on the world stage, some countries also don’t <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/01/what-people-around-the-world-like-and-dislike-about-american-society-and-politics/">think America is a great example of democracy</a>. The Pew Research Center in February <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/01/what-people-around-the-world-like-and-dislike-about-american-society-and-politics/">surveyed 16 countries</a>, finding a median of 57 percent of respondents thought the U.S. used to be a good example of democracy but hasn’t been in recent years. However, one of the areas in which countries thought the U.S. excelled was technological advancements. A median of 72 percent of respondents across these 16 countries said the U.S. was the best or above average in technological achievements.</li><li>Many Americans, 56 percent, told the Public Religion Research Institute in its 2021 American Values Survey, conducted in September, <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/competing-visions-of-america-an-evolving-identity-or-a-culture-under-attack/">that they thought believing in God was important to being truly American</a>, but a <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2021/10/28/in-u-s-far-more-support-than-oppose-separation-of-church-and-state/">separate poll from Pew</a> conducted in March found that many Americans, 55 percent, think separation of church and state is important.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-a-good-election-night-for-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great night for Republicans</a>. The GOP <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped the governor’s office in Virginia</a>, a race often seen as a bellwether for the following year’s midterm elections (though perhaps this is an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/#319479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overreaction</a>). But that wasn’t all. Even more impressively, Republicans came <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gov-phil-murphy-projected-winner-jersey-governors-race/story?id=80933002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarkably close to winning the New Jersey governor’s race</a>, which was not thought to be nearly as competitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 midterms, the better omen for the GOP might be how consistently they outperformed expectations across the board on Tuesday night. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans won not only the governorship in Virginia but also the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/politics/winsome-sears-virginia-lieutenant-governor-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lieutenant governor’s office</a> and <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2021/11/herring-concedes-to-miyares-in-virginia-attorney-general-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general’s office</a>. They appear to have gained one seat on net in the New Jersey state Senate and at least four (<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/dimaio-elected-assembly-minority-leader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perhaps as many as eight</a>) in the New Jersey General Assembly. And they won several down-ballot offices that hadn’t gotten as much attention, such as a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/spl/pennsylvania-supreme-court-candidates-2021-election-results-20211102.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Supreme Court seat</a> in Pennsylvania and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/republican-election-results-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">municipal offices</a> in New York. But the icing on the cake is that they took a majority in the <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/republicans-claim-house-majority-after-flipping-6th-seat/article_806a4149-8b34-5f6b-a908-032a70478aea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia House of Delegates</a>, putting them just one vote in the state Senate away from full control of state government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And these state-legislative elections arguably <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-virginia-mississippi-and-kentucky-can-tell-us-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have the most to tell us</a> about what the political environment will be in 2022. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve written previously</a>, special elections for both Congress and state legislatures can be quite predictive of the midterm elections they lead up to — as long as you consider them in aggregate and look at their margins of victory, not just who won.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, neither party has consistently punched above its weight in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional special elections held in 2021</a>. Perhaps this was, in part, because most special elections happened earlier in the year, when Biden was still popular. However, his approval ratings have since sunk (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 percent approval, 51 percent disapproval</a>),<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> and this week we got results from 100 Virginia House of Delegates elections and 40 New Jersey state Senate elections that took place under that anti-Democratic environment<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article won’t analyze the 40 elections for New Jersey General Assembly, the state’s lower chamber, that were also held on Tuesday. General Assembly districts elect two legislators each, and all candidates in the district run in the same race; the top two vote-getters are elected. This irregular arrangement makes Assembly races too different from typical elections to reliably analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> — and they exhibited a clear pattern of Republican overperformance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On average, the current<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> margins in those state-legislative races<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more specifically, those where both a Democrat and a Republican were active candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> are 7 percentage points better for Republicans than their districts’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan leans</a>.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> Specifically, Republicans overperformed by an average of 7 points in the Virginia House of Delegates:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This overperformance was consistent — Republicans outran partisan lean in almost every district. It was also the biggest overperformance we’ve seen in the three times that we’ve done this analysis for odd-year legislative elections — although, in fairness, that’s still a pretty small sample size. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2017-elections-suggest-incumbency-wont-save-republicans-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2017</a>, Democrats overperformed in the Virginia House of Delegates by 2 points and in the New Jersey Senate by 5 points; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-virginia-mississippi-and-kentucky-can-tell-us-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a>, Democrats overperformed in the Virginia state Senate by 4 points and in the Virginia House by 3 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since partisan lean represents our best guess of how a district would vote in a neutral political environment, this implies that the nation currently leans toward Republicans by 6 or 7 points. If that holds true a year from now, the 2022 midterms would be a veritable red wave. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we don’t yet know the partisan leans of all the House districts that will be on the ballot next year, because most <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still haven’t been drawn</a>. But just for illustrative purposes, if Republicans won every district in the current House map<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e., the one used in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> that has a partisan lean redder than D+7, they would flip 47 seats en route to a 260-175 majority. And if every state with a partisan lean redder than D+7 votes Republican for Senate next year, the GOP would flip five seats: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado. (This obviously ignores other potentially important factors like candidate quality; it’s just meant as an illustration of how impressive Republicans’ performance was on Tuesday.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, this is probably the <em>worst-case</em> scenario for Democrats, just as this 7-point Republican overperformance in 2021 legislative elections is the worst for Democrats of the handful of midterm indicators we currently have at our disposal. The most obvious piece of counterevidence: Democrats still lead polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> by an average of 2.3 points.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>21</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if I were the Democratic Party, I’d be feeling less comforted by that number after Tuesday. While polls are usually in the right ballpark, they are still subject to a margin of error, as Democrats themselves discovered in 2020, when the generic-ballot polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overestimated their margin</a> by 4.2 points. Plus, there was already good reason to think that generic-ballot polls right now are overestimating Democrats: Almost all so far have surveyed registered voters rather than likely voters, who tend to be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Republican-leaning group</a>, especially in a midterm election when the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-republicans-really-have-a-big-turnout-advantage-in-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president is a Democrat</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nothing about 2022 is written in stone, and there’s no guarantee that a red-wave election will come to fruition. But the historical expectation with a Democratic president has always been that Republicans would have a good election cycle, and the evidence for that is mounting. The Republican overperformance in the 2021 elections is simply a reminder of how bad things could get for Democrats.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">This is a tale of two pastors and two mass shootings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a balmy June evening in 2015, a young man with a blunt bowl haircut walked into the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/south-carolina-mother-emanuel-ame-church.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in Charleston, South Carolina, to join a Wednesday night Bible study. As the worshipers closed their eyes in prayer, the man fired at least 70 shots, killing nine people. Among the dead were Ethel Lee Lance, the mother of the Rev. Sharon Risher, and two of Risher’s cousins.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two years later, on a bright Sunday morning in November, a man in a skull face mask fired some 700 rounds outside and inside the <a href="http://ssfb.net/site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs</a>, Texas, leaving at least 20 people injured and 26 dead. A pregnant woman, her unborn baby and the 14-year-old daughter of the church’s pastor, Frank Pomeroy, were among those killed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is also a tale of two very different responses to tragedy and trauma. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both pastors buried their dead, mourned their incalculable losses, read their Bibles, prayed and eventually returned to their ministries. But Risher, a nondenominational Christian pastor, dedicated herself to gun-law reform and reducing access to weapons. Pomeroy, a Southern Baptist, armed and trained his church members and routinely wears his weapon in the pulpit.</p>

Sharon Risher, flanked by Democratic senators at the U.S. Capitol, joins other survivors of gun violence to call for gun control. <p>Win McNamee / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“To me, being a follower of Jesus means that I will always advocate for nonviolence,” Risher told me from her home in Charlotte, North Carolina, just a few days after the sixth anniversary of her mother’s murder. “My thinking is, I don’t condemn anyone for owning a gun, but I want people to realize the power of the violence they hold in their hand when they have a gun. And that just because you have a right to own a gun does not mean you have to exercise the right to use it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pomeroy, who has a military background and grew up hunting, sees carrying a gun as an extension of his responsibility to protect his flock. He is both licensed and trained to use a handgun and often carried one before the shooting at his rural church.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“God has endowed some of us with the capability to be a warrior and others not,” he said, sitting at his dining room table during a video interview. “Some are on the frontline, and some are in the supply room. Both are equally important, but they’re gifted in different ways. And that’s why it’s important that we go to the Lord and seek what we’re supposed to do individually. And then if he says, yes, carry that firearm, I have no problem carrying that firearm.”</p>

Both read the same Bible, worship the same God and have suffered unfathomable losses to unspeakable violence at the hands of disturbed individuals who managed to acquire legal firearms. Yet on the issue of guns, there is a gulf between them. And, perhaps what’s most important, Risher’s and Pomeroy’s dividing paths highlight two very different relationships between guns and God in America today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ passion for the right to bear arms has a long and well-known history. But the relationship between religion and guns is often obscured by the horror and tragedy of mass shootings like those that terrorized the Charleston and Sutherland Springs congregations. However, activists, scholars and pastors now point to a shift in the relationship between religion and guns, with more people of faith realizing that despite a range of views on the proliferation and use of guns, they have a theological and moral imperative to speak out on the issue. Even so, security-training companies say houses of worship make up the fastest-growing segment of their business as more churches, synagogues, mosques and temples are arming their congregations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The cross and the gun give us two really different versions of power,” said Shane Claiborne, a Christian activist and co-author of “<a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/beating-guns/388781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beating Guns: Hope for People Who Are Weary of Violence</a>.” “One of them says, ‘I’m willing to kill,’ and the other one says, ‘I’m willing to die.’”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As a pastor who owns and carries a gun, Pomeroy is not an outlier. Few studies examine gun ownership and religion, but scholars who have explored the subject see a definite link.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Religion does matter to gun ownership, but not in any one simplistic way,” said David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University who found that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312410212_Awash_in_a_Sea_of_Faith_and_Firearms_Rediscovering_the_Connection_Between_Religion_and_Gun_Ownership_in_America_FAITH_AND_FIREARMS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evangelical Protestants were more likely to be gun owners</a> compared with mainline Protestants, members of other religions and people with no religious affiliation. “The connection between gun ownership and religion is different depending on whether you are talking about religious behaving, belonging or believing.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yamane found, for instance, that Americans who hold more theologically conservative beliefs are more likely to own guns, but those who are more actively involved with their house of worship’s congregation are less likely to own guns. “These differences are essential to keep in mind if we want to have an accurate understanding of the connection between religion and guns,” he said.</p>

A member of the church’s security team, licensed to carry, shot and killed the perpetrator. The incident was captured during live video streaming of the service and has been watched on YouTube and Twitter millions of times.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">After every shooting, religious leaders appear in the media and call for peace and unity. Some, like Risher, call for “common-sense gun laws,” a term proponents of these measures prefer over “gun control,” which they say has a negative connotation. Others, including the Rev. Robert Jeffress, a member of former President Donald Trump’s faith advisory board, have no problem with their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/11/06/after-texas-church-massacre-a-push-for-armed-guards-and-gun-packing-parishioners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flock bringing guns to church for greater safety</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">"I'd say a quarter to a half of our members are concealed-carry — they have guns and I don't think there's anything wrong with that,” <a href="https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/927532536175009792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffress said on “Fox and Friends”</a> after the Sutherland Springs shooting. “They bring them into the church with them ... if somebody tries that in our church, they might get one shot off or two shots off, and that's the last thing they'll ever do in this life.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="http://ryanburge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Burge</a>, a professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University and an American Baptist Church pastor who has studied guns and religion, finds that political affiliation is a stronger indication of one’s views on guns than religion is, with Republicans more likely to support less legislation and Democrats in favor of more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gun control is a fascinating issue in American faith, because the data points to a clear conclusion,” <a href="https://religionunplugged.com/news/2020/7/2/party-politics-more-than-religion-drives-views-on-gun-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he wrote in 2020</a>. “Religious leaders are, by and large, not guiding the views of their congregations on this topic ... Americans of all religious faiths are less supportive of gun control now than at any point in the last two decades.” </p>

Cory Booker to speak about gun violence and its connection to white nationalism. <p>Randall Hill / REUTERS</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">On the organizational level, most denominations have made statements against gun violence — and sometimes, against guns themselves — especially after mass shootings. But only the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has ordained a “<a href="https://www.presbypeacefellowship.org/first-minister-of-gun-violence-prevention-ordained-in-the-united-states-presbyterian-rev-deanna-hollas-of-dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minister of gun violence prevention</a>,” the Rev. Deanna Hollas, who lives in a religious community outside Dallas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hollas felt called to this role when her daughter attended a Texas college that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/us/texas-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-guns-on-campus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows students to carry weapons on campus</a>. Now she visits mainline Protestant churches across the country to speak out against gun violence and perform “disarmings” — the dismantling of firearms per Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives guidelines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Not everyone is going to lay down their guns,” she said. “But we are going to say there is a different way.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Hollas is the only known minister exclusively assigned to work on gun violence, she believes that more people of faith are taking up the issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The good news is people are waking up to this,” she said. “Sight is being restored to the blind. The tools we have been using — that we are going to read and think our way out of gun violence — have not been effective. We are in the process of deconstructing that and realizing that we need to return to spiritual practices and embrace the faith of Jesus instead of the church of empire that we have inherited.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Increasingly, religious leaders in favor of gun reform are framing their argument as anti-violence rather than anti-gun. Among these are Claiborne, the Philadelphia-based leader of <a href="https://www.redletterchristians.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Letter Christians</a>, a faith-based organization that emphasizes the words of Jesus — which are printed in red letters in some Bibles — to oppose gun violence and other societal ills. Clairborne was raised in a hunting and gun-owning family but now travels the U.S. literally beating surrendered guns into garden tools and other implements.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We're worshipping the Prince of Peace on Sunday and packing heat on Monday, sometimes even packing heat on Sunday,” he said a few days before traveling to Houston to dismantle guns collected by a local congregation. “Some of our idolatry of individual rights is at the heart of this too.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Claiborne knows Christians who carry guns and bring them to church — <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/guns-in-public/location-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 states have no restrictions on doing so</a>. He said he understands Pomeroy’s decision to arm himself and his congregation but added that this doesn’t align with his understanding of the same faith.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It's very reasonable to do what the pastor at Sutherland Springs did,” he said, noting that he does not know Pomeroy and does not want to judge him. “In fact, it's exactly what [Jesus’ disciple] Peter wanted to do when he picked up a sword to try to defend Jesus, and Jesus says, ‘<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18:10-11&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Put your weapon away</a>.’ For me, as a Christian, there’s no way that I can reconcile Jesus’ call to love our enemy with this idea that we’re going to stand our ground or kill our enemy.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is Risher’s conclusion, too. She said she has forgiven her mother’s murderer. “If I did not, it was going to eat me alive,” she said. “And I wanted to live. And I did not want to live as a victim.” Now she travels the country to encourage other people of faith to put down any weapons they may own.</p>

Yes, God gives us prayer, but he gives us the motivation and the willingness to take action.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Claiborne’s actions have included organizing a <a href="https://www.redletterchristians.org/death-be-not-proud-the-easter-gospel-of-non-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peaceful protest and demonstration</a> outside a Philadelphia gun store. Risher volunteers with <a href="https://www.everytown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everytown for Gun Safety</a> and <a href="https://momsdemandaction.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>.

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pastormikemcbride.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rev. Michael McBride</a> is one of those pastors. As director of the <a href="http://www.livefreeusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Free Campaign</a>, an anti-violence and anti-mass-incarceration activist group, he and a cadre of San Francisco-area clergy routinely walk the streets of Oakland and other Bay Area cities where gun violence is routine. They do not focus on gun legislation, but on actions they hope will “interrupt” the cycle of violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gun control is one part of the conversation, but too many people in the gun-control community want gun control to be the lion’s share of the conversation,” he said. “I think at best it should be 25 percent of the conversation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McBride, who grew up in Hunter’s Point, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Troubling-trend-in-San-Francisco-32-jump-in-15585017.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hot spot for gun crimes in the Bay Area</a>, came to this work after seeing the results of gun violence up close. “Once you do a dozen funerals … it changed me,” he said. “I asked, ‘Is this the most that I could do?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now his group holds “call-ins” — mediated conversations between gun offenders, faith leaders, crime victims, ER nurses and police — and organizes 12-month programs for gun offenders, or “peace cohorts,” that focus on working them into their communities. Gun-control legislation, he said, rarely comes up as a viable solution to urban gun crimes, especially when he is facing an anguished mother who wants to know why her son or daughter was shot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The church, McBride said, should be an advocate for “common-sense gun legislation,” but it cannot end there. People of faith must also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675720305507?casa_token=fLGjlYBOxMMAAAAA:_0PBeCWDM99QcYDnSe1vHJz4YFrrHAIlUVyTXTXckYwyiL6jqoNnldTlOAWF50wdTNIc6cqe_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look at the causes of the violence</a> — income inequality, mass incarceration, mental-health issues and trauma, among them.</p>

We have to scale up intervention to change lives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s a tall order for anyone, clergy or layperson. Shani Buggs, a professor at University of California, Davis’s <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/vprp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violence Prevention Research Program</a>, said while some clergy are involved in violence-interruption programs, very few actively promote gun-reform laws.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s a complicated issue for them,” she said. “It has become increasingly political.” And politics is often considered taboo in houses of worship, which can lose their tax-exempt status if they engage in campaigning — not to mention lose members who may disagree.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No one knows this better than <a href="https://www.revrobschenck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rev. Rob Schenck</a>. Schenck spent 20 years as a very public activist for <a href="https://www.operationrescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Rescue</a>, the conservative Christian anti-abortion-rights group known for their graphic protests at women’s health clinics. He was also the president and founder of <a href="https://faithandlibertydc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faith and Action</a> (now Faith &amp; Liberty), a Washington, D.C., organization, which according to Schenck had 55,000 donors and a $2 million annual budget; the group’s aim was to increase Christianity’s influence on the U.S. government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the 2010s, Schenck had a change of heart on abortion, same-sex marriage and guns — three issues central to evangelical identity. In 2018, he resigned from Faith and Action over differences about his anti-gun mission. He then founded <a href="http://www.tdbi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dietrich Bonhoeffer Institute</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to the German cleric’s theology and ethics, which Schenck says has 4,000 donors and a $400,000 annual budget.</p>

Rob Schenck speaks at a press conference ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings to call on the Senate to pass gun-reform legislation. <p>MANDEL NGAN / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Schenck is not daunted by the change. Instead, he uses his experience inside the evangelical world to talk to conservative pastors and congregations about their affinity for guns. Drawing on his time in Operation Rescue, he frames his argument as an extension of the pro-life movement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m not the first one to have this thought, but the right to life does not end when the baby is born,” he said from his office in Washington, D.C. “That’s the way to find common ground with Catholics, with Jews, with Muslims, with conservatives, with liberals, with conservative Christians, progressive Christians, mainline Christians.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s still a hard sell. Schenck was the main subject of the 2015 documentary “<a href="https://www.armoroflightfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Armor of Light</a>,” which shows him trying to convince a room full of white evangelical clergy to join his side of the gun issue. They stare back at him as if he had asked them to fly to the moon and back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“When I look into the eyes of those folks, I think they really genuinely believe that God wants them to own a gun,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Schenck has hope. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young evangelicals like Claiborne are more open to questioning and reframing the church’s relationship with guns than their parents or grandparents were. “They’re more skeptical about the Second Amendment and the pro-gun culture and more serious about what Jesus literally said,” said Schenck. “They think this question is worth looking at.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/gun-ammunition-stores-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBISWorld</a>, an industry analyst, Americans spend $15 billion in gun stores annually. That includes everything from firearms and ammunition to cases, safes, apparel and accessories.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of these products link religion — most often Christianity — to the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. Go to Amazon, Etsy, Walmart or any major retail chain and you will see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raised-Protected-Glory-Pullover-Hoodie/dp/B08LM9B9Z3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothes</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1084793373/god-guns-trump-flag?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=flag+God+and+guns&amp;ref=sc_gallery-1-1&amp;plkey=a6cebffcb82cbe09b2ca445123b431fa4bf27135%3A1084793373&amp;frs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flags</a>, <a href="https://shopgodandguns.com/products/signature-charm-bracelet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charm bracelets</a>, <a href="https://www.hobbylobby.com/Home-Decor-Frames/Mirrors-Wall-Decor/Quote-Wall-Art/God-Guns-Guts-Metal-Wall-Decor/p/80826976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wall plaques</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/130566652931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license plate holders</a> and just about everything else available with symbols and slogans declaring fidelity to God and guns. One company called Tactical Baby Gear sells a patch emblazoned with <a href="https://tacticalbabygear.com/products/god-gods-diaper-patch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“God, Guns &amp; Diapers”</a> under the outline of an AR-15-style assault rifle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Schenck likes to bring out a black-bound, leather Bible cover that opens up to reveal not the usual tissue-thin pages but a 9mm Glock — a gun literally wrapped in the word of God.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In our defense of the Second Amendment,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrTkCPw1CQY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schenck asks in a video</a> as he holds the Bible-as-gun-case, “are we in fact violating the Second Commandment?” In Protestant faiths, that commandment is “Thou shalt not make any graven image.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And dozens of companies, from small mom-and-pop outfits to national organizations, offer security and firearms training specially tailored for pastors, ushers and greeters, and for teams of armed “guardians” or “gate keepers.” Agape Tactical offers a “<a href="https://agapetactical.com/services/warrior-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warrior Women</a>” class for armed women in the pews and quotes the biblical book of Proverbs on its website: “A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.” One pastor <a href="https://circuit-magazine.com/church-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Circuit Magazine</a>, “Church security is becoming the business of the church.” </p>

In 2015 — the year of the Mother Emanuel shooting — he said Strategos did church training sessions in 30 houses of worship. Now they do 300 annually, a number that spiked dramatically after the Sutherland Springs massacre<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/mass-shootings-church-synagogue-temple.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Strategos, which is Christian in its mission and has since conducted training at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, approaches its work like a ministry. Instructors and trainees pray and sometimes worship together.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We believe humility breeds capability,” he said in a phone interview from Kansas City, Missouri, where he is based. “I think you can tell how powerful somebody is by how gentle they are.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In its two-day church training workshops, Strategos teaches that the use of guns is a sort of last resort, Young said. First, they focus on awareness and prevention — strategically placing greeters in the parking lot, training ushers to spot erratic behavior, reconfiguring the church’s locks and other existing safety measures and — most importantly, Young said — verbal de-escalation methods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We choose who we certify to carry, not the church,” Young said. “They must have a mindset for safety. If they don’t exhibit the right frame of mind” — for example, if they are too eager to shoot or too nervous to shoot — “then we won’t certify them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young said Strategos declines to certify 2 to 5 percent of trainees because they do not pass this kind of “spiritual gut check.” And the majority — 85 percent — of its church workshops do not include guns, Young said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We will do it [gun training] if they ask,” Young said. “But I would rather a church have an unarmed security team that is trained than an armed security team that is untrained.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Like everyone else in this story, Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs looks at the relationship between guns and religion through the prism of his own experience. And that extends to losing members of his own congregation, including his daughter, to a disturbed man with a semi-automatic rifle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the media frenzy that descended on his white-walled church after the violence, Pomeroy feels he and other licensed, gun-carrying Christians have been unfairly portrayed as “ignorant hillbillies.” The decision to carry a gun in the pulpit, put about 20 of the church’s 187 members through security training and ensure 10 of them are armed every Sunday morning was made after prayer and reflection, he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He thinks it is a mistake to spiritualize a gun — an inanimate object — and likens his <a href="https://www.kimberamerica.com/pistols/micro-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kimber Micro 9 handgun</a> to the automated external defibrillator that hangs on the church wall. The spiritual question isn’t whether it should be there, but how it should be used.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The only spiritual aspect of this is the human condition,” Pomeroy said. “A person who wrongfully uses firearms to take a life has deeper issues than the firearm. They have sin problems and issues that need to be addressed on a spiritual level. The firearm itself is not the problem, it's the people holding those firearms.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs meets in a brand-new building. The old church was clapboard, and the shooter shot through its walls. The new building, which opened its doors in May 2019, is fortified limestone with sanctuary doors that can be locked at the press of a button.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pomeroy hopes he never has to use his gun inside his church (he was away in Oklahoma City on the day of the shooting). Today he speaks publicly in other churches and on panels about church security. Sometimes people on the panel oppose him, which he welcomes as a means to de-escalate the political polarization in America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When told about the Rev. Sharon Risher and how she came to a completely different understanding of guns through the lens of their shared Christianity, he said he would be open to talking to her about their shared experience as grieving survivors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If we don’t have an open mind and come to the table to have a conversation about it, then there’s no way to ever win,” he said. “And it isn’t about winning. It’s about doing what is best for people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“And I would pray for her,” Pomeroy adds. “Not to change her mind so much as that hopefully myself or someone like me is there to protect her when we’re needed because she wouldn't be able to protect herself.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Despite what you may have heard, Virginia can still be a purple state. Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-glenn-youngkin-projected-win-virginia-governors-race/story?id=80864529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s gubernatorial contest</a> on Tuesday, becoming the first Republican to win a statewide office in Virginia since 2009. As of Wednesday morning, Youngkin led by around 2.5 percentage points — pretty much in line with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what pre-election polls showed</a> and good enough to become the Old Dominion’s next governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Coming into the election, FiveThirtyEight put together benchmark margins in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_counties_in_Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all 133</a> of Virginia’s counties and independent cities based on <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2020 election result</a> to provide a road map to show which way the race was trending as the votes came in.<a data-footnote-id="25" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, we uniformly adjusted the 2020 margins to comprise a tied, 50-50 race &lt;em&gt;statewide&lt;/em&gt;. That way, the county-level margins marked what Youngkin or McAuliffe needed to beat in any particular county or independent city to win overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>25</sup></a> And we can use those now, with almost all the votes counted, to unpack how Youngkin won. In the near-final analysis, Youngkin prevailed by outperforming those benchmarks in most parts of the commonwealth — and beating former President Donald Trump’s performance in every locality in the state. The map and table below lay out how each county and city voted compared to the benchmarks, and they show the relative breadth of Youngkin’s gains.</p>

 <p>Vote margin calculated based on the two-party vote, which uses just the Democratic and Republican vote totals. Together, the share of the statewide vote and the benchmark margins produce a 50-50 tie, so performance relative to these benchmarks could signal which party is performing better on election night.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Performing well in the suburbs, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/trump-broke-suburbs-gop-virginia-516412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump struggled</a>, is key to unlocking Virginia, and Youngkin made serious inroads in those parts of the state. Take Loudoun and Chesterfield counties, two of the largest suburban counties in the state. Loudoun, which sits outside of Washington, D.C., still went for McAuliffe by about 11 percentage points, but that marked a huge deterioration for Democrats in comparison to Biden’s 25-point edge there last November. This was an example of Youngkin not necessarily needing to win a fairly blue municipality, but doing enough to cut the margins to help his cause overall. Chesterfield, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/election-2020/democrats-flip-chesterfield-blue-for-first-time-in-72-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditionally been a Republican-leaning county</a> that sits just south of the state capital of Richmond. Biden won it by about 7 points in 2020, but Chesterfield returned to its formerly red ways as Youngkin carried it by close to 10 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, the main areas where Youngkin didn’t improve as markedly (and ran behind our benchmarks) tended to be very red localities in the western part of the state. But Youngkin still won all those strongly Republican places by huge margins anyway, outperforming Trump. And as land, rocks and trees can’t vote, Youngkin’s tremendous showing in the more populous parts of Virginia really gave him his victory on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the sizable shifts toward the GOP across the commonwealth, Virginia’s result wasn’t just about Youngkin, however. One inescapable fact about this election is that it took place in an environment that was favorable to Republicans. There’s no better indicator of that than President Biden’s poor approval rating, which stood at about 43 percent coming into Election Day in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>. Republicans were already more likely to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show up in reaction</a> to having a Democratic president, and Biden’s struggles likely turned off some independent voters, too, as the exit poll found they went for Youngkin by 9 points, 54 percent to 45 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Youngkin improved on Trump’s performance with white voters (both men and especially women), who also made up a bigger share of the electorate this year compared to 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia exit polls</a>. White Virginians accounted for 74 percent of voters, up from 67 percent last year. In particular, Youngkin did significantly better than Trump among white women with “some college or less,” per the exit polls: He carried that group 75 percent to 25 percent, greatly improving on Trump’s 56 percent to 44 percent performance with them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The simplest way, though, to describe how Youngkin won is basically that he just performed better across the board, and did so via both turnout and vote choice. At least according to the exit polls (which aren’t always reliable, so we’ll be looking at this question in other ways in the coming days), the electorate that turned out in 2021 was older and whiter than the one that turned out in 2020, and more friendly to Republicans in other ways. And Youngkin improved on Trump’s performance with a host of demographic groups across that electorate.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, just over 3.3 million Virginians cast a ballot, which works out to around 52 to 53 percent of the voting-eligible population -- record turnout for a modern Virginia governor’s race. If the competitiveness of the 2020 presidential election with <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTIONS/oakvendenpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest turnout</a> since women got the right to vote didn’t convince you that Republicans can benefit as much or even more from high-turnout elections than Democrats, perhaps the Virginia election will be the nail in the coffin for the belief that high turnout is only good for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The support Youngkin attracted also materialized down the ballot at a similar rate, too, as the Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/statewide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won nearly identical shares of the vote to Youngkin</a> (as of this writing, only the lieutenant governor race <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/winsome-sears-voted-virginias-next-lieutenant-governor-first-woman-to-hold-position" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been projected for the GOP</a>). The similarity in results is unsurprising in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarized age</a> with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little ticket-splitting</a>, and those factors appear to have potentially given <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans the edge in the Virginia House of Delegates</a>, too, as they led 51 seats to 49 seats in still-to-be-finalized results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the wake of this victory, many Republicans are sure to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2021-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embrace the campaign strategy and chief issues</a> that Youngkin used in his victorious effort. That means trying to straddle being pro-Trump but not so Trump-y that you repel suburban voters, while also talking about “education” and the economy. (For a discussion of how education became an umbrella term that includes race, racism, COVID-19 school closures and more, please <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our election live blog</a>.) The exit polls in Virginia found those were the two most important topics for voters, with Youngkin winning voters who prioritized those issues by a little more than 10 points. This approach is not guaranteed to work for every Republican candidate in 2022, but it could be a useful road map for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-virginia-governors-race-is-not-a-good-political-barometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t know with absolute certainty</a> that the Virginia race is a harbinger of things to come in the 2022 midterm elections, but the result does show how damaging an electoral environment like the current one could be for the Democrats next year. History suggests they, as the party that holds the White House, have a hard road to keep control of Congress in 2022, but the Virginia race demonstrates how even seemingly winnable races could be lost if Biden remains as unpopular as he is now. How much Biden rights the ship of state in the coming months will be critical to determining just how ripe of an environment Republicans have next year.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, gun rights is <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-bruen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back at the Supreme Court</a> for the first time in over a decade. The justices will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/us/supreme-court-gun.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighing the constitutionality of a New York law</a> that imposes limits on carrying guns outside the home, setting up a showdown over just how far the Second Amendment goes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Depending on what the justices do, this case could have a <em>much</em> bigger impact on Americans’ lives — and the fate of gun regulations more broadly — than the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-second-amendment-didnt-protect-your-right-to-own-a-gun-until-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court’s last blockbuster gun rights decision</a>. Although that decision, released in 2008 as part of a case called <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, profoundly shifted the law around the Second Amendment by determining that the amendment covered the personal right to own a gun, it directly affected only a handful of gun restrictions. And <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research conducted over the past 10 years</a> hasn’t found a big shift in how lower courts are interpreting the Second Amendment; few gun laws have been struck down as a result.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could change this time. At a minimum, striking down the New York law would likely result in changes to concealed-carry regulations in at least <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2021/05/supreme-court-gun-rights-concealed-carry-new-york-corlett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six other states</a>, which could mean more guns on the streets of the nation’s two biggest cities. And if the court’s conservative majority decides to issue a more sweeping decision, this case could also open the door for a flood of challenges to other gun restrictions.</p>



<h2><strong>The last big gun rights ruling left lots of restrictions in place</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s ruling in Heller was undeniably a big deal, at least symbolically. For more than 200 years, the federal courts had approached the Second Amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-ii/interps/99" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a right that belonged to a “well-regulated militia”</a> as outlined in the Constitution — not an individual person’s right to own a gun. But colonial-era militias faded away relatively quickly, which made it pretty much impossible for anyone to successfully argue that their Second Amendment rights were being violated, according to <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/dmiller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darrell Miller</a>, a professor at Duke University School of Law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That changed after 2008. In the Heller ruling, a five-justice Supreme Court majority said that focusing on the militia was a misunderstanding of the core meaning of the Second Amendment. Americans did possess an individual right to carry guns in defense of their home, much as gun rights advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/nra-second-amendment-guns-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been arguing</a> for the past few decades. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In his dissent</a>, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens called it a “law-changing decision” and a “dramatic upheaval in the law.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stevens was right — and wrong. Heller <em>was</em> a fundamental change in constitutional rights. “It was a big deal to have the Supreme Court of the United States say to gun rights advocates, ‘Yes, actually, you have a meritorious argument about a Second Amendment right to have a gun in the home,’” Miller said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on a practical level, Heller’s impact was quite limited. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the majority opinion</a>, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stressed that there were still plenty of circumstances in which gun regulations were constitutional. “Nothing in our opinion,” he wrote, “should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/amendment-didnt-protect-gun-2008-fivethirtyeight-80824464</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And over the next 10 years, the decision didn’t revolutionize gun laws. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a study</a>, law professors Eric Ruben and Joseph Blocher analyzed over 1,000 lower-court decisions involving the Second Amendment between June 26, 2008 — when Heller was decided — and February 1, 2016. They found that very few of those cases were successful. In many cases, judges quoted Scalia’s caveat in their opinion, underscoring the fact that they saw plenty of room for regulation within the Heller decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Many people feared or hoped that gun laws would fall like dominoes [after Heller],” Ruben said. But that hasn’t proved to be the case. In fact, Ruben added, “judges of all ideological stripes have been upholding gun laws.”</p>



<h2><strong>But this gun rights case could change regulations across the country</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The case the justices will hear this term, though, directly addresses one of the most important questions left open by Heller: Can states put restrictions on Americans’ ability to carry guns in public for self-defense? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Specifically, they’ll be weighing a New York law that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/26/22364154/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment-new-york-state-rifle-corlett-shootings-kavanaugh-barrett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires applicants for gun licenses to show</a> “proper cause,” <a href="https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-klenosky-v-ny-city-police-dept" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally understood to mean</a> a heightened need for self-defense in the public sphere. At least six other states, including California, have similar laws, which means that striking down the New York regulation would have far-reaching implications. Those states would likely need to modify their restrictions in ways that would allow a lot more people to obtain guns. And that would have an impact on a lot of people, since it’s currently extremely difficult to get a concealed-carry permit in large cities like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-does-it-really-take-to-get-a-concealed-carry-permit-in-new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/los-angeles-sheriff-expand-concealed-weapons-permits-crime-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gun rights advocates argue that looser regulations on concealed weapons <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/184422/20210720153608584_20-843%20tsac%20Arizona%20Missouri%20et%20al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would actually make those cities safer</a>, since everyday people would be in a better position to defend themselves. But there’s a lot of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence suggesting that’s not true</a>. Multiple <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31361355/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> have suggested that a heavily armed populace doesn’t increase safety — in fact, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one study found</a> that relaxing permit requirements was associated with an increase in violent crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just the fate of concealed-carry restrictions that could hang in the balance in this case, though. The Supreme Court could issue a far-reaching ruling that not only strikes down New York’s law but also sets out a whole new way of evaluating whether gun regulations are constitutional — calling many kinds of gun laws into question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are clues to how the court could do this <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/07/judge-kavanaugh-and-the-second-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a sequel case to Heller</a> that was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2011, when now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a circuit court judge on the panel. <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DECA496973477C748525791F004D84F9/%24file/10-7036-1333156.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavanaugh dissented</a> from the majority opinion, which upheld a D.C. ban on semiautomatic weapons. He argued that when considering the constitutionality of gun regulations, judges should use an approach that weighs the “text, history, and tradition” of a given kind of law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the other conservatives could be open to that line of thinking. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-confirmation/2020/10/13/923215778/barrett-an-originalist-says-meaning-of-constitution-doesn-t-change-over-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a self-proclaimed textualist</a>, was skeptical of gun restrictions as a lower-court judge, too, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-barrett-gun-laws/2020/10/10/3845995e-0976-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going so far as to argue</a> in a 2019 dissent that some felons shouldn’t be stripped of their rights to own guns. Justice Clarence Thomas has also been outspoken about his desire to take on more gun cases. In 2018, he dissented from the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear a case about a California gun law, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/thomas-dissents-from-supreme-court-decision-not-to-review-california-gun-law/2018/02/20/342c378e-164d-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling the Second Amendment a “constitutional orphan.”</a> And the third Trump appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has less of a paper trail on gun rights, but <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2017/03/neil-gorsuch-gun-rights-advocates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocates expect him to be sympathetic to textualist arguments</a> — much as Scalia was.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard, of course, to predict how the justices will come down in this specific case, and even Kavanaugh’s approach wouldn’t necessarily spell the end of gun regulation, since as Ruben pointed out, gun regulation has existed for a long time in the United States — in fact, the New York law that’s being challenged <a href="https://nypost.com/2012/01/16/the-strange-birth-of-nys-gun-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is more than 100 years old</a>. But it could lead to a lot of complications, since <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/20/opinions/supreme-court-gun-rights-case-lethality-tucker/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guns are much deadlier now</a> than when the Second Amendment was written, and the mass violence that gun regulations are designed to combat <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-09-01/mass-shooting-data-odessa-midland-increase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is itself a modern phenomenon</a>, which could make a historical approach pretty challenging.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as Ruben pointed out, this approach could leave plenty of room for discretion on the part of judges trying to figure out whether gun laws are constitutional, which is important because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-made-the-federal-courts-whiter-and-more-conservative-and-that-will-be-tough-for-biden-to-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the federal judiciary is much more conservative</a> than it was 10 years ago. “Trying to decide whether a modern taser law is sufficiently similar to historical laws on muskets or other weapons — there’s so much subjectivity in that,” he said. More broadly, Americans’ gun rights are also still being worked out in real time. “It’s being articulated and developed for the first time in our lifetimes, and that makes it unique among constitutional rights,” Ruben said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means there’s a lot of room for the new conservative majority to shape gun rights in America going forward — if they can get on the same page about what that should look like.</p>]]></description>

			<title>The U.S. Has A Lot Of Guns Involved In Crimes But Very Little Data On Where They Came From</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In August, police in Pennsylvania and New Jersey <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/acting-ag-bruck-and-ag-shapiro-announce-arrests-of-three-men-charged-with-trafficking-untraceable-ghost-guns-from-pennsylvania-into-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested three men</a> they said were smuggling untraceable guns across state lines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Prosecutors have charged the men with several crimes related to a scheme in which they allegedly bought unfinished gun parts in Pennsylvania, assembled them into untraceable firearms with no serial numbers and sold them in New Jersey. Police used a confidential informant to buy nine handguns, six semi-automatic rifles, nine large-capacity magazines and a silencer, according to one of the men’s arrest affidavits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unfinished gun parts that don’t meet the legal definition of a firearm <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/are-%E2%80%9C80%E2%80%9D-or-%E2%80%9Cunfinished%E2%80%9D-receivers-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t regulated</a> under federal law, which <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-individual-need-license-make-firearm-personal-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows</a> people who can legally own guns to build these kinds of untraceable firearms for personal use. But <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/ghost-guns-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> is one of a <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/hardware-ammunition/ghost-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handful of states</a> that require privately made firearms to be registered. The men now face multiple charges of breaking that law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The case highlights the problem of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/us/politics/ghost-guns-explainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so-called “ghost guns,”</a> untraceable homemade weapons that can be assembled from kits bought online, in stores or at gun shows — or even 3D printed using plans available online.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re seeing a big increase in them,” Frank Vanore, chief of detectives for the Philadelphia Police Department, said of these homemade weapons.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2019, police in Philadelphia recovered 95 ghost guns, according to data the department shared with FiveThirtyEight. Last year, it was 250. This year is on track to double that, with 389 recovered as of Sept. 10.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That rise tracks with a broader national trend, experts say. But it’s still just roughly 9 percent of the 4,190 guns that Philadelphia police recovered during the same time period this year. Most guns involved in crimes took more well-worn routes, like straw purchasing or theft, Vanore said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vanore said the ways guns were trafficked made it hard to answer basic questions like how many might be stolen each year. Often, he said, police found trafficked guns only after they were used in a crime. Experts who spoke with FiveThirtyEight said there was no clear, national data on how crime guns go from manufacturers and dealers to the black market, how trafficking differed from state to state or even the street price of trafficked firearms in different markets. The <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/following-gun-enforcing-federal-laws-against-firearms-traffickers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent federal report</a> on gun trafficking dates from 2000, and it used data from 1996 to 1998.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s administration is looking to change that with a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initial-actions-to-address-the-gun-violence-public-health-epidemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trafficking report</a>, due out next year, that the administration says will be updated annually. Still, Congress has strictly limited what gun data can be released. And even then, federal officials may not have a complete picture of how many crime guns local police recover, nor where they come from, experts say.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Ideal world, what we do is every time a gun is connected to a crime or a violent crime, there’s an exhaustive investigation that connects the dots and sort of traces the path of that gun to that criminal or crime scene,” said Daniel Webster, director of the Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy at Johns Hopkins University. “And the truth is, that almost never happens.”</p>



<h2><strong>Lots of guns but little data</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Any gun can become a crime gun — it just has to be used in a crime. In 2012, Webster and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins looked at 2004 data on where people in state prisons had obtained the gun(s) they used to commit their most recent crimes. And <a href="https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/19/1/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the researchers found</a> that in the 13 states with the most lenient gun laws, about 60 percent of the inmates had been legal gun owners.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies in other states and cities</a> have found that most guns used in crimes were purchased illegally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are about 400 million guns and about 100 million gun owners in the United States, according to Tom Chittum, the number-two official at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. But Chittum was quick to add, “The vast majority of those [firearms] are never going to be used in a crime.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When a gun is used in a crime, local law enforcement can submit it to ATF for tracing. The bureau then uses the gun’s unique serial number to trace it to the original dealer, which must maintain records of every sale for at least 20 years. In 2019, the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/146976/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average time</a> from when a gun was first purchased to when it was traced by ATF — a metric the bureau calls “time to crime” — was 8.29 years. But that metric comes with a big caveat. Since ATF traces only to the first retail sale, it can’t see if someone bought a preowned gun at a pawnshop and then used it in a crime the next day, for example. The same goes for private sales and trafficked weapons. Any tracing beyond the first sale is up to local law enforcement. In other words, the time-to-crime metric is limited in what it says about where crime guns originate from.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There are some gaps in there, and it’s hard for us to always identify when these things occur,” Chittum said. “But we do what we can with what we have.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same is true of the handful of <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local, state and federal prison surveys</a> that asked people convicted of crimes involving guns where they got their weapons. Often, Webster said, their answer was “on the street.” But that doesn’t say much about how a weapon got from a legitimate dealer to the street in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[The surveys] only ask about the most immediate transfer,” Webster said. “And it doesn’t tell you the path which that gun took to get to that individual.”</p>



<h2><strong>How a legal gun becomes a crime gun</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">No expert who spoke with FiveThirtyEight would put a number on the different ways guns wound up on the street, but they did give a breakdown of the major categories. Two of the most prominent are straw purchases and thefts — although ghost guns, the secondary market and failures in the background check system also contribute to the problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ways that guns are trafficked, though, can make it difficult to know how a firearm wound up in the wrong hands, often by design.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a straw purchase, for example, someone buys a gun on behalf of someone else — either because the real buyer can’t legally own a gun or because they don’t want the gun traced to them. Straw purchasing is <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/10-people-indicted-scheme-%E2%80%9Cstraw-purchase%E2%80%9D-firearms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal under federal law</a>, but it can be tricky to spot since it’s legal to buy a gun as a legitimate gift for someone else — as is selling a gun you own, so long as you’re not “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged in the business</a>” of dealing guns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because straw purchasing can be so hard to spot, law enforcement often detects it only once a gun has been used in a violent crime, according to Chittum. “The straws, by their very nature, don’t have any criminal history or any serious criminal history — at least no criminal history that would prohibit them [from legally owning a gun],” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Theft is another major way that guns move to the illegal market. Criminals have been known to use vehicles to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22smash+and+grab%22+%22gun+store%22+truck+OR+car+OR+vehicle&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=896&amp;tbs=sbd%3A1&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=v5Z5YbmrHoH2-gTWkoeYCg&amp;oq=%22smash+and+grab%22+%22gun+store%22+truck+OR+car+OR+vehicle&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i10i160k1.30311.35204.0.35396.12.12.0.0.0.0.316.1658.0j5j2j1.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.7.1485...33i299k1j33i160k1.0.56I4Cj5D7kQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smash through the fronts of gun stores</a>, and ATF said it now had a 100 percent response rate when there was a burglary at a licensed firearms dealer. But thefts from dealers are “a drop in the bucket” when compared to thefts from individuals, Chittum said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Data from the Philadelphia Police Department shows 1,009 guns stolen in 2019 and 1,244 stolen in 2020. This year, the department had recorded 855 gun thefts as of Sept. 10 — on track to meet or exceed last year’s total.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vanore said the city saw a decline in thefts from residences because more people stayed home during the pandemic, yet thefts from cars skyrocketed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other experts say it’s not uncommon for criminals to break into cars outside events that ban weapons — at a stadium, for example — or to target vehicles where there’s some visible indication that the owner might be a gun enthusiast.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peter Gagliardi is a law enforcement consultant who spent more than two decades as an ATF special agent. He said people sometimes telegraphed that they were gun owners, which allowed criminals to “know where the fish are.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They throw a line in,” he said. “Maybe they catch one, maybe they don’t.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Things get messy when law enforcement sees the same person reporting several thefts over a period of time. Sometimes, straw purchasers will report the guns they buy for other people as stolen to cover their tracks. Those false reports can muddy the data on gun trafficking, but they can also help law enforcement uncover straw-purchasing schemes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As you start to dig into these, you kind of see that the same person reported multiple guns stolen over the last year or two, and that’s when it starts to become somewhat suspicious and we begin to look at it a little more closely,” Vanore said.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/amendment-didnt-protect-gun-2008-fivethirtyeight-80824464</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Then there are ghost guns. Building one isn’t trivial, and 3D printing one can take special skill, as Vice News showed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4dBuPJ9p7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent video documentary</a>. But companies sell kits online that allow people to make fully functional handguns and rifles from their homes with just a few tools, some know-how and a little time. Step-by-step instructions are easy to find on YouTube.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The weapons have been showing up at crime scenes with increasing frequency, too, according to experts — including at least <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/ex-con-who-killed-california-cop-used-homemade-ghost-gun-n1042811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two mass shootings</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/us/saugus-shooting-ghost-gun/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one school shooting</a> in California. ATF is finalizing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-ghost-guns/2021/05/07/0d20ef86-af74-11eb-acd3-24b44a57093a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new federal regulations</a> that would change the definition of a “firearm” under federal law, potentially making it much harder to build an untraceable weapon. But a federal appeals court also <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-lifts-ban-on-3d-printed-gun-blueprints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loosened restrictions</a> this year on digital blueprints for 3D-printed guns, which could make ghost guns more readily accessible.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some crime guns also come from the secondary market — gun shows, online classifieds sites that specialize in firearms as well as other private sales that don’t require a background check under federal law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, private sales can be hard to distinguish from straw purchases. As Chittum explained, if you meet up with someone in a gas station parking lot to transfer a gun you just bought on their behalf, that’s an illegal straw purchase. But if you buy a gun, decide it was a waste of money half an hour later and offer to sell it to the person at the next gas pump for cash, that’s legal in <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/#footnote_6_4119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most states</a> — federal law doesn’t require a background check for private sales.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, problems with the gun background check system sometimes let people who can’t legally own a gun buy one from a licensed dealer. It’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-people-are-buying-guns-fewer-people-are-getting-background-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impossible to know</a> how many times that happens each year because of how the FBI stores gun background check records. But there have been several high-profile shootings where the shooter bought their weapon because the background check system failed, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/714921726/20-years-on-the-background-check-system-continues-to-miss-dangerous-gun-buyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including</a> the 2017 shooting at a church in Texas, the 2015 shooting at a church in South Carolina and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/714921726/20-years-on-the-background-check-system-continues-to-miss-dangerous-gun-buyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2007 shooting</a> at Virginia Tech.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2019, <a href="https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last year for which data is available</a>, every state and territory was its own biggest source of crime guns that were traced by ATF, with just three exceptions — <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/147311/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puerto Rico</a>, the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/147351/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> and <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/146976/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington, D.C</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean interstate trafficking isn’t a problem with crime guns, though. In <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/147286/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, for example, more than twice as many guns involved in crimes came from southern states as came from in-state, following a route known as the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQiKrzUsZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iron pipeline</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During Gagliardi’s time as special agent in charge of ATF’s New York Division, many of the crime guns he saw came from southern states with less restrictive gun laws, he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Heat flows from hot to cold,” he said.</p>



<h2><strong>The gun industry’s role</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">ATF’s 2000 report found that licensed gun dealers were involved in less than 10 percent of its trafficking investigations from July 1996 to December 1998. But that small percentage was responsible for <em>nearly half</em> of all the trafficked firearms the bureau investigated during that period.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, in 2003, Congress <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RS22458.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed an appropriations rider</a> known as the Tiahrt Amendment — named after its sponsor, then-Rep. Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, a Republican — that blocks ATF from releasing gun trace data, except for some official purposes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There hasn’t been a trace report since. The bureau can still release aggregate statistics but not detailed data that could identify corrupt gun dealers, for example.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A lot of this information is hard to get [now], and that’s precisely the intent of the gun industry,” said Rob Wilcox, federal legal director for the gun control group Everytown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The gun industry, though, says it has worked with ATF and individual dealers to crack down on gun trafficking. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the industry, runs a training program for gun dealers and an advertising campaign to discourage straw purchasing, and it provides dealers with resources to prevent thefts. The group also <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/atf-nssf-offer-reward-gun-store-burglary-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matches ATF’s rewards</a> for information on gun-store burglaries.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lawrence Keane, the foundation’s senior vice president of government and public affairs, said his group supported increased funding to ATF and the gun background check system, which is operated by the FBI.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You walk into a Republican appropriator’s office and say you want more money for ATF, you get kind of a strange look,” he said. “But we have, and we’ve been successful.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Keane said he was skeptical about whether there was indeed a rise in the use of ghost guns for crimes. He’s “never seen the data,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s emblematic of the larger gun debate, where the two sides can barely agree on what the facts are — much less what policies could change them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in Philadelphia, Frank Vanore, the police detective, is worried about how many young people are carrying weapons. The city recently surpassed 400 homicides for the second year in only two decades, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/crime/philadelphia-homicides-record-400-gun-violence-20210926.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. One of those victims, 15-year-old Simone-Monea Rogers, died in August after being <a href="https://www.phillytrib.com/news/local_news/girl-15-who-was-shot-at-north-philly-basketball-court-dies/article_76c48cc3-01f6-5ad6-be58-dabc6673734c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot in the face</a> by a stray bullet while playing basketball on a playground.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vanore said the incident showed the human cost behind the muddled data and policy debates around gun trafficking — and the need to get more weapons off the street.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They use that gun, their life’s done,” he said. “You know what I mean? They fire that gun, there’s no bringing that bullet back.”<br></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It may not be a presidential or midterm election year, but 2021 has its fair share of important votes happening on Tuesday. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-republican-might-win-in-virginias-governor-race-and-how-new-jerseys-race-could-get-tighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s gubernatorial election</a> is clearly the most noteworthy race, but <a href="https://whatsontheballot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several other elections</a> — from legislative races to mayoral campaigns to ballot measures to special elections — could have big consequences as well. So buckle up as FiveThirtyEight takes you on a tour of what to watch on Election Day 2021.</p>

<h2>Is Virginia truly a blue state?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s main event will happen in Virginia, where Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin are vying to be the commonwealth’s next governor. And the race is pretty much tied, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Virginia polling average</a>, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if either candidate comes out on top.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1766" height="1234" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">On one hand, the competitiveness of the race is a bit surprising as Virginia has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaned Democratic in recent years.</a> It <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for President Biden by 10 points in 2020</a>, and it has elected a Democrat in every statewide election dating back to 2012.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President and U.S. Senate in 2012; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2013; U.S. Senate in 2014; president in 2016; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2017; U.S. Senate in 2018; and president and U.S. Senate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> But on the other hand, this D+5 state, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean</a>,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> is still very susceptible to shifts in the national environment. And thanks to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular Democratic president in the White House</a>, the electoral environment currently favors the GOP. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Headed into the election, Biden’s approval rating sits at about 43 percent and his disapproval rating at about 51 percent, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> It’s underwater in Virginia, too. Recent polls from <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2021/10_26_2021_marginals.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=C18DD5B48B481336D2DC949F917376F13E0F8BE2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today/Suffolk University</a>, <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-24-27_Virginia_Topline_October-28-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/29/virginia-governors-race-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post/Schar School</a> found Biden’s approval rating in the mid-to-low 40s. This may galvanize Republicans — who were already more likely to show up at the polls <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in reaction to having a Democratic president</a> — while also potentially <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/18/biden-approval-rating-virginia-gubernatorial-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repelling some independents</a> who backed Biden last November. It’s also dampened enthusiasm among Democrats. <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-10-27.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The final poll</a> from Christopher Newport University’s Wason Center found that 80 percent of Republicans were “very enthusiastic” about voting, compared with just 65 percent of Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is hardly new territory for McAuliffe. He was in the same position in 2013 when another unpopular Democratic president, Barack Obama, was in the White House. Obama’s approval numbers were nearly identical to Biden’s right now, yet McAuliffe <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2013&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still managed to win</a>. In fact, McAuliffe’s victory <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-surprisingly-dramatic-terry-ken-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the first for the president’s party</a> in a Virginia gubernatorial race since the GOP won in 1973, during Richard Nixon’s presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thanks to Virginia’s one-term limit for elected governors, McAuliffe wasn’t able to seek reelection in 2017, but it’s plausible that McAuliffe should be in an even stronger position this time around, as <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2018-02-07.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he left office popular</a>. Virginia is also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Democratic-leaning now</a> than it was in 2013. Yet Youngkin looks more formidable than McAuliffe’s 2013 foe, then-state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2013/11/06/terry-mcauliffe-three-reasons-why-he-is-the-new-governor-elect-of-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy to cast as a right-wing ideologue</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-trounces-cuccinelli-in-late-donations-in-virginia-governors-race/2013/10/31/f0749b7a-423a-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t keep pace with McAuliffe</a> in fundraising. Youngkin, meanwhile, is leaning into his appeal as an outsider — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/virginia-republicans-just-gave-themselves-a-chance-to-win-back-the-governorship/2021/05/11/574c545a-b281-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s never run for office before</a> — and <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/amount-raised-statewide-candidates-oct-25-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s kept up</a> with McAuliffe in fundraising, thanks in part to self-funding from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governors-race-financial-disclosures/2021/07/01/b697b70e-da9c-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immense personal wealth</a> he accrued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/glenn-youngkin-fortune-carlyle-virginia/2021/08/02/aeeebab4-efc5-11eb-81d2-ffae0f931b8f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the finance industry</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Youngkin has also homed in on education in an attempt <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/virginia-governor-youngkin-education-gop-516625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to capitalize on</a> debates over <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how race is taught in schools</a>. His campaign has <a href="https://youtu.be/zafXDPCDsTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run ads criticizing McAuliffe</a> for saying in a recent debate that he didn’t “think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” McAuliffe was defending his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-vetoes-bill-that-would-have-allowed-parents-to-block-sexually-explicit-books-in-school/2016/04/04/8b969316-fa75-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 veto of legislation</a> that would have allowed parents to have their children “opt out” from reading school books with sexually explicit content, but McAuliffe is clearly concerned about Youngkin’s line of attack, as he’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaaavis/status/1450199344863399939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countered with his own ad</a> in which he says he’s “always valued the concerns of parents.” But in an effort not to give McAuliffe the final word on the matter, Youngkin closed his campaign with <a href="https://theweek.com/book-list/1006408/virginia-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-glenn-youngkin-runs-attack-ad-against-toni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ad featuring a woman criticizing</a> McAuliffe’s veto because her son had to read an explicit book in a college-level high school English course. (The ad doesn’t mention the title, but it was Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer-Prize-winning “Beloved,” a novel dealing with the horrors of slavery.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This could pay off for Youngkin, too, as USA Today/Suffolk found that 50 percent of likely voters thought parents should have more influence on school curricula than school boards, while 39 percent said school boards should have more influence. Fox News’s recent poll also found likely voters trusted Youngkin more on education, a shift from <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-10-13_Virginia_Topline_October-14-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two weeks earlier when its poll found</a> McAuliffe narrowly ahead on the issue, while the Washington Post/Schar School survey found the candidates running even on the issue even though voters had previously trusted McAuliffe more than Youngkin in their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-post-schar-poll/2021/09/17/11c4d042-164f-11ec-a5e5-ceecb895922f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early September poll</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, McAuliffe has continued to score better on COVID-19. Virginians are <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_VA_092721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to support vaccine requirements</a> for professions such as teachers and health care workers, and in most polls have said McAuliffe <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_va_102021.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would handle the pandemic best</a>. However, The Washington Post/Schar School’s final survey suggested — to Youngkin’s potential benefit — that the coronavirus has become a less pressing issue since September, as education and the economy clearly led the way as the top issues for likely voters, while the pandemic faded to a distant third.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But McAuliffe isn’t just campaigning on the pandemic; one of his chief approaches has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/virginiagovernortrumptake/2021/10/23/a1975068-340f-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to link Youngkin to former President Trump</a> to motivate Democrats and keep independent voters at an arm’s length from Youngkin. McAuliffe has played up <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-election-ef10f05ada241421ed40e1d1fbf355cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement of Youngkin</a> and used <a href="https://youtu.be/4eaDAX29ogM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youngkin’s opposition</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mask-vaccine-mandates/2021/08/12/05eb7d70-fad4-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine and mask mandates</a> and the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/mcauliffe-youngkin-virginia-ads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican nominee’s support</a> for supposed “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-race-trump-2020-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election integrity</a>” efforts that question the validity of the 2020 election as evidence that Youngkin is a chip off the old Trump block.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having won only 44 percent of the vote in Virginia in both 2016 and 2020, Trump has a fairly toxic brand in the commonwealth. And in California’s recent election, Democrats’ efforts to link radio host Larry Elder to Trump do <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appear to have helped turn out Democrats</a> to defeat the attempt to recall Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. However, Youngkin doesn’t have Elder’s history of controversial, Trump-esque statements to attack, and California is a far bluer state than Virginia, so <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/politics/analysis-democrats-virginia-governor-election-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-based attacks may not be enough</a> for McAuliffe to edge out Youngkin.</p>

<h2>Is New Jersey’s gubernatorial race competitive?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may be positioned in a smaller typeface below Virginia on the Election Day marquee, but the New Jersey gubernatorial election could prove more interesting than we might have expected a few months ago. The contest between incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, had mostly simmered on the backburner as Murphy held polling leads <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/fdu-poll-murphy-leads-a-mostly-unknown-ciatterelli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of more than 10 points</a> in nonpartisan polls <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_081821.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up through August</a>. However, as Biden’s ratings have tumbled, polls suggest <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the New Jersey contest might be a bit closer</a> than it was before, although Murphy remains a substantial favorite to win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, a survey from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_nj_102721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a> — which calls New Jersey home — found Murphy leading by 11 points among registered voters, with the incumbent leading by 8 to 14 points in its likely voter model — a smaller advantage than in Monmouth’s previous polls (9 to 19 points). Additionally, a <a href="https://stockton.edu/hughes-center/polling/documents/2021-1028-stockton-poll-shows-murphy-maintains-lead-over-ciattarelli.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockton University poll</a> found Murphy ahead by 9 points among likely voters, while a <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/murphy-retains-lead-builds-momentum-among-independents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairleigh Dickinson University survey</a> of registered voters put Murphy up by 9 points, but the pollster didn’t release a likely voter figure. But another recent nonpartisan survey, from <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/new-jersey-2021-gov-murphy-with-six-point-lead-over-republican-challenger-ciattarelli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIX 11/Emerson College</a>, found a closer contest with Murphy ahead by about 4 points among likely voters.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including undecideds who leaned toward a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> The latest Monmouth and Emerson polls found Murphy remains more popular than not, however, as Monmouth put his approval at 52 percent and his disapproval at 39 percent, while Emerson found 49 percent had a favorable view of the governor versus 47 percent who had an unfavorable impression.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-us-political-forces-aligned-climate-change-silver-80888230</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Those surveys suggest that Murphy retains a meaningful edge, but they also contain some warning signs for the Democrat. Monmouth’s poll found Biden’s approval rating among New Jerseyans had fallen to 43 percent, while his disapproval rating stood at 49 percent — this in a state Biden carried by 16 points in 2020. And while Monmouth’s polling has consistently found Murphy with strong ratings regarding his handling of COVID-19, the latest poll showed the issue has become less pressing to voters, whereas issues like taxes, as well as jobs and the economy (mirroring a similar trend in Virginia), have become more important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Murphy doesn’t really have an edge over Ciattarelli on those issues either, as the two candidates ran even on whom voters trusted more to handle jobs and the economy in Monmouth’s polling, with more voters saying they trusted Ciattarelli than Murphy on taxes. Emerson’s poll also showed that 51 percent of voters felt taxes should be the top priority for the next governor, which could work to Ciattarelli’s advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Ciattarelli has an uphill battle ahead of him to actually win, not only because Murphy remains relatively popular and New Jersey is a blue state, but also because his side has fewer resources to work with. Although both candidates took public funding, <a href="https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/gubernatorial/GubPublicFinPP_112020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which severely limited</a> the <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/11/we-poured-through-gov-phil-murphys-sprawling-tax-returns-heres-what-we-found.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally wealthy</a> Murphy’s ability to self-fund, outside groups supporting the incumbent governor <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/nj-governor-race-spending-soars-to-nearly-46m-almost-double-from-4-years-ago.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have vastly outspent those backing his GOP opponent</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the campaigns of Murphy and Ciattarelli have each spent around $12.5 million, pro-Murphy independent committees have spent $18.4 million, compared with just $2.7 million by pro-Ciattarelli groups. Most of the spending on Ciattarelli’s behalf comes from the Republican Governors Association, but notably the RGA hasn’t spent much more than it did on behalf of the Republican nominee for governor in Murphy’s initial race back in 2017. That, along with the polling data, still shows Ciattarelli is an underdog — but perhaps he’s not quite as far out of the race as it once seemed.</p>

<h2>What else is at stake in Virginia and New Jersey</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Virginia and New Jersey have more on the line on Tuesday than just their governor’s races, though. Virginians will also be voting for lieutenant governor and attorney general, and what happens at the top of the ticket in the gubernatorial contest will likely have a strong effect on the results in those races. That’s because recent elections have seen very little split-ticket voting, so the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/democratic-domination-in-the-old-dominion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two parties have won similar vote shares</a> across all three contests. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the party that wins the governorship will likely also win the other two positions, both of which Democrats currently hold, although an extremely tight election could produce a split-ticket result. We have limited polling to work with for the lieutenant governor and attorney general races, but the numbers we have seen suggests they are also quite close.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But regardless of the results, some history will be made in Virginia’s statewide down-ballot contests. For starters, its lieutenant governor race will produce the state’s first female lieutenant governor, as Democrat Hala Ayala, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/hala-ayala-lieutenant-governor-virginia/2021/10/15/c10aac82-1d81-11ec-bcb8-0cb135811007_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the House of Delegates</a> from northern Virginia, faces Republican Winsome Sears, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/winsome-sears-virginia-lieutenant-governor/2021/10/15/002d1004-26b9-11ec-8831-a31e7b3de188_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">herself a former delegate</a> from the southeastern part of the state. And the pair constitute a historic matchup, as Ayala <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/democrat-hala-ayala-seeks-virginias-first-latina-female-lieutenant-gov-rcna4013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a woman of color</a> who identifies as Afro Latina and works in cybersecurity, while the <a href="https://www.nycaribnews.com/articles/jamaican-born-winsome-sears-vies-for-win-in-virginia-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamaican-born Sears</a> is a Marine Corps veteran and remains the only Black Republican woman to ever be <a href="https://www.localdvm.com/news/capitol-review/one-on-one-with-winsome-sears-republican-candidate-for-virginias-lt-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected to the House of Delegates</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the race for attorney general will either produce the state’s first AG to win three consecutive terms <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1929/year_to:2021/office_id:12/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the 1940s</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/miyares-virginia-attorney-general-race/2021/10/22/08da03e4-32c4-11ec-a1e5-07223c50280a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Latino to hold the office</a>. Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring is seeking his third consecutive term after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mark-herring-run-attorney-general/2020/09/02/d36714f4-ed41-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoning an anticipated gubernatorial run</a> following the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-no-one-should-be-surprised-by-democratic-calls-for-northams-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Party of Virginia’s turbulent 2019</a>, when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/virginia-attorney-general-blackface/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herring admitted</a> that he’d worn blackface at a party as a college student in 1980. (This came out after reports revealed Gov.

But in order to pull this off, he’ll first have to defeat Republican state Del. Jason Miyares, who is Cuban American and a lawyer by trade.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Virginians will also elect the 100 members of the House of Delegates, the lower chamber of the state legislature. (The 40-seat Virginia Senate isn’t up again until 2023.) As things stand now, Democrats hold a 55-to-45 edge in the House, but <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZRfFiCDBEYB7M18fDGLH8IrmyMQGdQKqpOu9lLvmdo/edit#gid=1838276900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Democratic-held seats</a> that the party captured in 2017 and 2019 are competitive and <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could now flip back to the GOP</a> in a more Republican-leaning environment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furthermore, because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-delayed-census-has-affected-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the delayed release of census data</a> due to COVID-19, Virginia is holding its state House elections <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/census-delays-virginia-redistricting-november-2021-election/291-96095d24-f19c-44f0-80a9-d94f463323df" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under the lines drawn after the 2010 census</a> instead of a new map <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/will-virginia-delegates-have-to-run-again-in-2022-a-judge-could-decide-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflecting the population changes</a> in the 2020 census. As such, Republicans might stand to benefit because much of the House map was <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/republicans-certain-to-retain-control-of-virginia-house-of-delegates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally drawn to heavily advantage the GOP</a>. Additionally, the old lines don’t account for <a href="http://statchatva.org/2020/01/27/population-growth-in-virginia-slowest-in-a-century-as-out-migration-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the disproportionate population growth</a> the more Democratic-leaning areas have experienced over the past decade, especially in Northern Virginia.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, New Jersey also has its legislative elections on Tuesday, but there’s not much drama there. Democrats hold a 25-to-15 advantage in the state Senate and a 52-to-28 edge in the General Assembly. <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/the-entire-nj-legislature-is-up-for-grabs-on-election-day-here-are-the-races-to-watch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s little reason to think</a> their majorities in either chamber are under threat.</p>

<h2>The parade of special elections continues</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also three special elections for Congress taking place on Tuesday. The two general elections in Ohio — one in the dark-blue <strong>11th District</strong>, one in the solidly red <strong>15th District</strong> — are uncompetitive,<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primaries, which you might remember from August, were &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ohios-two-special-primary-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;much more interesting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a> although the winning candidates’ margins will give us more data about whether Democrats or Republicans are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperforming expectations</a> so far in the 2022 election cycle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the primary phase of the special election in <strong>Florida’s 20th District</strong> looks like a jump ball. The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/FL/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Florida district</a>, left vacant by the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-alcee-hastings-civil-right-impeached-judge-congress-obituary-20210406-lnjgt4hokrh3zdzacufao4erqm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of former Rep. Alcee Hastings</a> in April, is extremely blue, so the winner of the Democratic primary is all but guaranteed to win the January general election. However, 11 Democrats are on the ballot, and at least six could plausibly win the nomination. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No polls have been conducted since July, but health care executive Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is leading the money race, having raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8FL20032/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.8 million</a> through Oct. 13 — $3.7 million of it from her own pockets. Broward County Commissioner Barbara Sharief has pulled in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20134/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$895,000</a> and has also been <a href="https://friendsofbarbarashariefforcongress.com/press-and-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> by neighboring Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel and a former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Broward County Commissioner Dale Holness, a <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-dale-holness-alcee-hastings-congress-20210412-56aj375pm5g3lacvkduoma6pgi-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close ally of the late Hastings</a>, has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20159/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$584,000</a>. State Sen. Perry Thurston (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20183/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$458,000</a>) and state House Minority Leader Bobby DuBose (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20209/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$419,000</a>) round out the top five fundraisers. Finally, state Rep. Omari Hardy has pulled in only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20217/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$172,000</a> but has earned a national following online for his progressive activism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As always, there are <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/10/06/liberal-moderate-rift-not-a-factor-in-crowded-florida-primary-to-succeed-alcee-hastings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some ideological divisions in the race</a>: For instance, Cherfilus-McCormick (who has the endorsement of 2020 presidential candidate and author Marianne Williamson) and Hardy (who has the endorsement of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee) are pitching themselves as progressives, while Sharief has called herself a “fiscal moderate and a social progressive.” But the race has largely avoided devolving into a proxy war between the left and the establishment. Instead, issues such as <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/08/biden-haiti-migration-refugee-democrats-backlash-state-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. policy toward Haiti</a> (the district is home to many Haitian Americans) have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/23/us-house-races-election-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken center stage</a>.</p>

<h2>Several mayoral races are progressive-moderate showdowns</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you’re looking for left-vs.-establishment proxy wars, though, the nation’s mayoral races have you covered. At least five major cities will choose between a progressive and a more moderate Democrat to be their next mayor.</p>



<ul><li>In <strong>Boston</strong>, <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/massachusetts2/2021/10_19_2021_marginals.pdf">polls</a> have put City Councilor Michelle Wu around <a href="https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2021/10/Crosstabs-2021-10-Boston-Mayor-Mayor-City-Council.pdf">30 points</a> ahead of City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George. Wu, a protegée of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is a <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/18/michelle-wu-boston-city-councilor-mayor-election-chicago">dyed-in-the-wool progressive</a>, while Essaibi George is <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/21/annissa-essaibi-george-mayor-boston-electon">more closely aligned</a> with Biden and former Mayor Marty Walsh (who left city hall to become Biden’s secretary of labor). Either Wu or Essaibi George would be the first woman and the first person of color to be elected mayor of Boston, a city with a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-boston-busing-crisis-was-never-intended-to-work/474264/">sordid history of racism</a> but that has become <a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/32e9b68a-ce1b-41c7-808c-0395cb4f4d19">majority-minority</a>.</li><li>The mayor’s office is also open in <strong>Seattle</strong>, where former City Council President Bruce Harrell is going head-to-head against current City Council President Lorena González. Progressives like <a href="https://lorenaforseattle.com/endorsements/">Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal</a> have lined up behind González, while Harrell was regarded as <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/former-council-president-bruce-harrell-touts-community-roots-strength-and-unity-in-bid-for-seattle-mayor/">more business-friendly</a> during his <a href="https://crosscut.com/politics/2021/10/what-gonzalez-and-harrells-council-votes-say-about-their-mayoral-bids">time on the council</a>. Harrell has taken the <a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2021/seattle-mayor-candidates-mayoral-general-election-guide/">more moderate (though still pretty liberal) positions</a> in this race, too, and he led González in the <a href="https://www.nwprogressive.org/weblog/2021/10/as-voting-begins-in-the-2021-seattle-mayoral-race-bruce-harrell-has-a-sixteen-point-lead.html">most recent poll</a>, 48 percent to 32 percent. González also stumbled in the home stretch when she put out an ad in which a white rape survivor accused Harrell, who is Black and Japanese, of not taking sexual-abuse allegations in city government seriously. Harrell denounced the ad as racist, and González eventually <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/m-lorena-gonzalez-pulls-ad-against-bruce-harrell-that-many-criticized-as-racist-in-final-weeks-of-seattle-mayoral-race/">agreed to stop airing it</a>.</li><li>By contrast, there’s no clear favorite in the race to be the next mayor of <strong>Cleveland</strong>; the <a href="https://www.bw.edu/news/2021/fall/10-justin-bibb-leads-kevin-kelley-in-bw-cri-mayoral-poll-40-still-undecided">two</a> <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/justin-bibb-kevin-kelley-kick-off-general-election-with-endorsements-poll">polls</a> we’ve seen have both been within the margin of error, with around 40 percent of voters undecided. The <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/door-to-door-getting-to-know-justin-bibb-and-kevin-kelley">contrasts in the race are sharp</a>: City Council President Kevin Kelley is a 53-year-old white moderate with the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Frank Jackson, and nonprofit executive Justin Bibb is a 34-year-old Black progressive who has never before run for office. One of the biggest issues in the race has been <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/elections/cleveland-mayoral-election/cleveland-police-reform-proposal-issue-24-still-fueling-debate/95-6f0802e1-2be8-43e6-a84a-f9b9d3001cba">Issue 24</a>, a ballot measure to create a civilian commission to oversee the Cleveland police. Bibb supports it, while Kelley opposes it.</li><li>Passions over policing are still high in <strong>Minneapolis</strong>, too, where Mayor Jacob Frey will face voters for the first time since the murder of George Floyd and the ensuing protests that engulfed the city. With Minneapolitans also voting on local ballot measures to give the mayor’s office more power or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-reform-is-on-the-ballot-in-minneapolis-but-its-about-more-than-defunding-the-police/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-reform-is-on-the-ballot-in-minneapolis-but-its-about-more-than-defunding-the-police/">take the police department out from under its control</a>, the campaign has become a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/public-safety-debate-dominates-mayoral-race/600107324/">referendum on the best way to ensure public safety</a>. Frey has opposed <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/26/minneapolis-council-puts-plan-to-dismantle-police-in-motion">previous efforts to defund the police</a> and attempted to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/20/veto-threat-is-the-latest-wrinkle-in-controversial-mpls-public-safety-ballot-proposal">keep the police-reform ballot measure off the ballot</a>, while his two most prominent opponents, community organizer Sheila Nezhad and former state Rep. Kate Knuth, support the measure and say Frey didn’t do enough to reform policing before Floyd’s death. Nezhad and Knuth have even <a href="https://www.startribune.com/divided-left-field-of-minneapolis-mayoral-hopefuls-have-unified-message-don-t-rank-frey/600107813/?refresh=true">formed an alliance</a>, encouraging their supporters to rank the other second under Minneapolis’s ranked-choice voting system (and not to rank Frey at all). The <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2021/10/an-internal-poll-showed-frey-with-a-19-point-lead-in-the-minneapolis-mayoral-race-but-in-an-rcv-election-he-could-still-lose/">only poll of the race</a> gave Frey 44 percent, Nezhad 25 percent and Knuth 10 percent in the first round, but the poll was conducted by Frey’s supporters, so it’s very possible the race is closer than that.</li><li><strong>Buffalo</strong> is smaller than the other cities here, but its mayor’s race has big drama. Back in June, union representative and democratic socialist India Walton shockingly upset four-term Mayor Byron Brown, 52 percent to 45 percent, in the Democratic primary. But Brown refused to give up his campaign: After a <a href="https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/politics/elections/mayor-byron-brown-loses-court-decision-india-walton-mayoral-race/71-e5ca91fc-610b-4a1a-9b92-226f3b5d6530">failed attempt</a> to make the November ballot as an independent, he is <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/byron-brown-launches-write-in-campaign-for-mayor-as-others-eye-the-race/article_4e459acc-d83f-11eb-b7cb-cb943e248a2a.html">waging a write-in campaign</a> to keep his job. As Walton’s only opponent, Brown is getting support from <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/26/democrat-gets-gop-support-as-write-in-over-socialist-in-buffalo-mayors-race/">local conservatives</a>; some prominent Democrats, such as Gov. Kathy Hochul, have also conspicuously <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2021/10/prominent-new-york-democrats-who-have-not-endorsed-india-walton/186221/">failed to endorse Walton</a>, although <a href="https://www.audacy.com/wben/news/politics/walton-racking-up-major-endorsements-ahead-of-election">she’s received backing</a> from others, such as Sens.

As hard as winning a write-in campaign is, Brown may be forming a winning coalition: A recent <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/buffalo-ny-incumbent-mayor-brown-continues-to-lead-mayoral-race-with-write-in-campaign">Emerson College poll</a> of likely voters put Walton at just 36 percent, while 54 percent volunteered that they were voting for Brown. </li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">It doesn’t break down cleanly along ideological lines, but the campaign for mayor of <strong>Atlanta</strong> is also worth your attention.

<h2>Ballot measures are the icing on the cake</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In odd-year elections, ballot measures are often some of the most interesting races to watch. Unfortunately, 2021 is a bit of a down year for them — perhaps the lingering effects of the pandemic, which also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coronavirus-upends-elections-ballot-access-point-concern/story?id=70288113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowed ballot-measure campaigns in 2020</a>. But there are nevertheless a few worth watching — most obviously, three constitutional amendments over voting rights in <strong>New York</strong>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Proposal 1</strong> would change the state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex redistricting process</a> to make it easier for the ruling party to pass its desired maps. New York has a bipartisan redistricting commission, but it’s only advisory in nature: The legislature has the final say in either approving the commission’s proposals or simply imposing its own. Under current law, when the legislature is controlled by a single party (as it is currently, by Democrats), a two-thirds supermajority is required to pass any maps. Proposal 1, however, would <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/capital-region/politics/2021/09/24/new-york-s-november-ballot-questions---1---amending-the-state-s-redistricting-process-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower this threshold</a> to a simple majority to pass one of the commission’s maps and a 60 percent majority to impose its own.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Practically speaking, this may not make a huge difference to the current redistricting process, since Democrats already enjoy two-thirds supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. But it could be the difference between a minority party having a seat at the table in future redistricting cycles, and it could also allow current Democrats to gerrymander the state even if they have a few dissenters within their ranks. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Further down the ballot, New Yorkers will find <strong>Proposal 3</strong>, which would <a href="https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2021/09/27/new-york-s-2021-ballot-questions---3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate the requirement</a> that people register to vote 10 days before an election, and <strong>Proposal 4</strong>, which would <a href="https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2021/09/27/new-york-s-2021-ballot-questions---4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate the requirement</a> that voters provide an excuse to vote absentee. With voting access increasingly a hot-button partisan issue, New York has gotten a lot of attention for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/nyregion/early-voting-reform-laws-ny.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how restrictive its voting laws are</a>, especially for a blue state. Democrats have been working to liberalize them since taking full control of state government in 2018, but because many of New York’s voting restrictions are enshrined in the state constitution, they couldn’t eliminate them right away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If these amendments pass, the legislature would be able to pass a law allowing people to register to vote on Election Day (which is one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/opinion/graphics-an-excitingly-simple-solution-to-youth-turnout-for-the-primaries-and-beyond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful election reforms</a> for increasing turnout) and would not need to renew a temporary law (expiring at the end of the year) that added “risk of contracting … a communicable disease like COVID-19” to the list of <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingAbsentee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acceptable excuses for voting absentee</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Almost exactly two months after the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed a novel abortion ban to go into effect in Texas</a>, making it functionally impossible to obtain abortions in the state, the law is back in the justices’ laps. Today, though, the justices won’t directly consider the constitutionality of the ban, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/18/texas-heartbeat-bill-abortions-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which prohibits abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected</a> — often before women know they’re pregnant. Instead, they’ll be grappling with the law’s unique structure, which raises some thorny questions about the federal courts’ power over the states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Texas did wasn’t noteworthy because of <em>at what stage</em> it banned abortion. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plenty of other states</a> have already passed laws restricting abortion after six weeks, or banning it outright. The Texas law’s innovation was <em>how</em> it banned abortion: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/us/politics/texas-abortion-law-facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Private citizens who successfully sue an individual</a> for helping a woman get a prohibited abortion are eligible for a $10,000 reward, putting responsibility for enforcing the law in the hands of vigilante plaintiffs — and, crucially, taking it out of the hands of state officials, like prosecutors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear at this point whether the conservative justices have changed their minds about the Texas law since September. After all, the court recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/us/supreme-court-abortion-texas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose once again</a> to leave the law in place while the legal battle plays out — although it did add the case to its docket at lightning speed, suggesting the justices are looking to make a decision soon. There are signs, though, that the law’s unusual enforcement mechanism may be its undoing: While a majority of justices on the Supreme Court may be willing to reconsider the constitutional right to abortion, giving states the power to pass laws like Texas’s might be a bridge too far even for the court’s conservatives. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It may have dawned on the justices that there’s nothing stopping a state like Massachusetts from passing a similar law on a different issue, like the right to bear arms or free speech on college campuses,” said <a href="https://law.fsu.edu/faculty-staff/mary-ziegler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ziegler</a>, a law professor at Florida State University. And, she added, there are cleaner ways to overturn or limit Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion — including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a case involving a more straightforward Mississippi law</a> that will be heard by the court in December.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At its core, the Texas law is a solution to a dilemma that anti-abortion advocates have struggled with for years. Increasingly, Republican-controlled state legislatures <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2019/03/surge-bans-abortion-early-six-weeks-most-people-know-they-are-pregnant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been willing to pass laws</a> — like a six-week ban on abortion — that openly violate Roe. But with the exception of the Texas ban, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none of those laws are actually in effect</a>, because federal courts <a href="https://time.com/5866714/georgia-heartbeat-abortion-law-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put them on pause</a> while legal challenges played out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas’s innovation was to make it exceptionally difficult for the courts to get involved. Normally, abortion providers sue a state official in charge of enforcing a given abortion law. But by making individuals responsible for enforcement, Texas changed the game — leaving abortion providers with no one to sue, and no obvious way for the federal courts to intervene. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was, as Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/21a24_8759.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in his dissent</a> from the court’s September decision to let the Texas law go into effect, an “unprecedented” approach that was apparently designed to cut the federal courts out of the loop. And it was successful, at least provisionally, since the law is in effect in Texas and, as a result, abortion is currently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-lifestyle-health-travel-texas-fbc505c3db4a08af51ba409a91ea161c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtually impossible to obtain</a> in the state.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But now, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-asks-us-supreme-court-block-texas-abortion-law-2021-10-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced with reviewing a separate lawsuit from President Biden’s administration</a>, the justices have given themselves an opportunity to untangle some of the knottiness of the Texas law — specifically, what role the federal courts have to play. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/22/1047619075/the-supreme-court-keeps-texas-abortion-law-in-place-but-agrees-to-review-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They’re looking at two different questions</a>: whether the federal government can even bring a lawsuit in federal court to stop the law from being enforced, and whether states, such as Texas, can try to create an end-run around the federal courts when constitutional rights are at stake. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Ziegler, the structure of the Texas law could be a deal-breaker even to justices open to stricter abortion laws, since the law allows a state to functionally override a Supreme Court precedent. That approach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-06/op-ed-how-texas-abortion-law-could-threaten-other-constitutional-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could extend far beyond abortion</a> and be used with other constitutional rights. “Before, Texas looked to be in the clear with this court, and that isn’t the case now,” she said. “That doesn’t mean the state will definitely lose, but the law is in real jeopardy now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, too, this case adds a new layer of complication at a moment that was already very busy and high-profile for the justices. In a few days, they’ll hear oral arguments in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-bruen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court’s first big gun rights case</a> in over a decade. And then, in early December, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ll weigh another abortion restriction</a> — a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which could give them the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade. So the back-and-forth over the Texas law might be an unwelcome distraction for the conservative justices, who didn’t need another chance to reconsider whether abortion is constitutional. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also not a done deal. After all, the Texas law is still in effect, which signals that five of the court’s conservative justices are still unconcerned about abortion’s availability in one of the country’s biggest states, even while Roe v. Wade is still on the books. And in that sense, whatever happens next, anti-abortion advocates in the state have already scored a big victory. By allowing the restriction to go into effect, the Supreme Court permitted the state to effectively ban abortion, forcing women to flood neighboring states to obtain the procedure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the conservative justices’ willingness to let that happen could signal that anti-abortion advocates are about to win a much bigger victory — even if the Texas law doesn’t ultimately survive.</p>
