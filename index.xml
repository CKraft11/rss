<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow week of polling over the holiday weekend</a> — happy birthday, USA — and the FiveThirtyEight midterm election forecast hasn’t changed much since we launched it last week. Republicans have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an 86 percent chance of winning control of the House in November</a> according to the Deluxe version of our model. But the Senate is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much closer to a toss-up</a>, with Republicans at a 53 percent chance of a takeover. Both of those numbers are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-are-favored-to-win-the-house-but-not-the-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty much the same as when we launched the model</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we’ve seen some movement toward Democrats on the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they would support in an election. Democrats now trail Republicans by 1.6 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight average. That compares with a 2.3-point deficit on June 24, when the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health</a> that it would overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why make a huge deal of the difference between 2.3 points and 1.6 points? Well, I’m not making a <em>huge</em> deal of it. But because of the way our polling average is designed, it’s a bigger deal than it might seem at first glance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The truth is, when you design any sort of model, it’s rarely as simple as just following the data. Rather, you have a lot of choices to make. One of the most important ones is how sensitive a model or an average is to <em>new</em> data. It’s obviously possible to err in either direction. There’s a lot of noise in polling averages, and you don’t want a model that does acrobatics in response to every new poll, especially when it’s still many months out from the election and most voters are thinking more about what kind of meat to grill than about whom to elect to Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But polls can and do change in response to big news, and Roe being overturned — probably the most well-known Supreme Court decision of the past 50 years — is big news.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Usually, the generic ballot is a noisy measure, and if you know nothing about what’s causing the changes, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-a-new-less-volatile-version-of-our-generic-ballot-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best empirical strategy is to be quite conservative</a> in updating the average. If the polls move by several points and there’s no real underlying cause, it’s <em>probably</em> just noise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After all, most people — even most people who vote in congressional elections — are not following the news intensely on a day-to-day basis. Cable news ratings, for instance, reflect a <em>tiny</em> fraction of the American population: The most-watched cable news program is seen by something like <a href="https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/here-are-the-top-rated-cable-news-shows-for-q2-2022/510090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 percent of Americans on a typical night</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, in figuring out whether shifts in a polling average represent signal or noise, the model averages out <em>lots</em> of times when there’s nothing much going on and a <em>few</em> times when there is. The safe bet is usually “probably mostly noise, awaiting more evidence of signal.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-overturns-roe-wade-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85666091</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But given that we do have a huge story on our hands, let’s do a direct before-and-after comparison. Six pollsters<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov has released polls in partnership with both Yahoo News and The Economist, but because of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1544674762332557313?s=20&amp;amp;t=svq7hp1sSmWNfnH0sWGzvw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;technical issue with the YouGov/Economist polls&lt;/a&gt;, we’re using only the Yahoo News version here. Note, however, that the Economist polls have also shown a shift toward Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> have released generic ballot polls both before and after the Dobbs decision.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By “after,” we mean that the poll went into the field on June 24 or later, and by “before,” we mean that the poll went into the field between May 15 and June 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> All six of those polling firms have shown a shift toward Democrats. On average, Democrats trailed by 1.3 points in the pre-Dobbs version of these polls but led by 1.5 points in the most recent ones, a shift of almost 3 points toward the party.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">If this persists, then our generic ballot average — and also our midterm model — will eventually catch up and move toward Democrats. Of course, that might not happen. The change <em>could</em> still be a statistical quirk. Or it could be temporary, an <a href="https://agadjanianpolitics.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/possible-evidence-of-differential-partisan-nonresponse-in-trump-approval-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artifact of partisan nonresponse bias</a>. That is, if Democrats are more engaged than Republicans by news of the Supreme Court’s decision — and there’s <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3537982-democrats-more-likely-to-vote-in-midterms-after-abortion-ruling-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence to suggest they are</a> — they may be more likely to respond to polls for some period of time, at least until the next news story takes hold. Then again, if Democrats are more motivated than Republicans to <em>vote</em> by the decision, that could help them in a real way in November, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bottom line: Most of the time, polling averages are exceptionally useful, but be wary of using them in ways in which they weren’t intended. The FiveThirtyEight generic ballot polling average is designed<em> </em>to be conservative and slow-moving and not really equipped to deal with breaking-news developments.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-makes-our-new-2020-democratic-primary-polling-averages-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;experimented with techniques&lt;/a&gt; in our presidential polling averages that allow them to move rapidly in response to pre-scheduled news events such as conventions and debates, but there’s nothing like that for the generic ballot yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> That our generic ballot polling average is steady in reaction to the news doesn’t really prove anything either way, then. But because of the Dobbs decision, there may be some electoral upside for Democrats beyond what our model currently shows.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are feeling uneasy, and it’s hard to blame them. The things they want to change — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/business/economy/inflation-economy-recession.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/11/this-covid-wave-might-be-the-start-of-our-new-normal-experts-say.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 case numbers</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/democrats-crime-gun-violence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising violent crime</a> in some cities — seem more and more intractable. There was one big, abrupt shift in American life at the end of June, when the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a>. But that wasn’t a change <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/06/majority-of-public-disapproves-of-supreme-courts-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans wanted</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This sense of dissatisfaction showed up in <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent poll from Gallup</a>, which asked Americans how much confidence they have in various institutions. The survey found that since last June, when Gallup last asked this set of questions, Americans’ confidence in almost every institution has dropped. In the poll, which was conducted before the justices released their decision on abortion but after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a draft of the opinion leaked</a>, the biggest shifts were for the presidency, which saw a 15-percentage-point drop, and the Supreme Court, which saw an 11-point drop. But overall, the national mood is sour. Americans’ average confidence in 14 of the institutions that Gallup asked about was only at 27 percent — the lowest point since Gallup began the survey in 1979.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans' trust in major institutions reaches a new low" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/11amQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="402" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Americans aren’t just cynical about their political institutions. In <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup’s trends</a>, you can see more and more disillusionment with pretty much every major institution. Some of these shifts are hard to blame on politics — confidence in banks, for instance, fell dramatically during the Great Recession. But experts told me that they’re also the result of increasing partisan polarization and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/10/12/conservatives-have-long-stoked-distrust-government-now-were-paying-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades-long effort</a> by the Republican Party to sow distrust in a wide range of government institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic may have also reinforced Americans’ sense that the government won’t be there for them in times of crisis: According to <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_070522/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Monmouth University poll</a> conducted from June 23-27, 57 percent of Americans said that the actions of the federal government over the past six months have hurt their family regarding the issue most important to them, up from 34 percent in July 2021 and 46 percent in December.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This broad loss of faith in the institutions that organize our society is dangerous, experts say — and it may be hard to reverse. “Despite the political polarization, both sides feel like they’re losing,” said <a href="https://fletcher.tufts.edu/people/faculty/daniel-drezner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Drezner</a>, a professor of international politics at Tufts University. “And populaces and countries that are pessimistic about the future often end up doing really bad things.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-approval-rating-dropping-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85385158</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The idea that the government doesn’t work for people — and therefore, we should have less of it — can be traced back decades, to the political campaigns of former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Those messages fed a sense of cynicism that was already growing, according to <a href="https://umaine.edu/polisci/faculty-and-staff/amy-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Fried</a>, a political science professor at the University of Maine who has studied the history of political mistrust. “Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there are all of these upheavals — Watergate, the Vietnam War, riots, assassinations,” she said. But politicians — mostly Republicans — have since amplified Americans’ doubts by continuing to talk about government overreach and corruption. Former President Donald Trump dialed up these messages, attacking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-convention-further-alienates-wall-street-and-its-money-players/2016/07/19/5872ade8-4dd2-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banks</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/18/why-is-donald-trump-attacking-the-us-intelligence-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">country’s</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42360540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligence agencies</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-longstanding-history-calling-elections-rigged-doesnt-results/story?id=74126926" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its election system</a> during his campaigns and presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Political allegiances increasingly shape the way Americans view all kinds of institutions, too. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are the obvious ones</a> — Democrats have more confidence in the presidency when a Democrat is in the White House, Republicans have more confidence in Congress when the GOP is in control — but trust in the medical system, organized religion and public schools are all shaped by partisanship too. According to Gallup, between 2021 and 2022, Republicans’ confidence in the military fell from 81 percent to 71 percent — a shift that Drezner said could be due to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/31/majority-of-u-s-public-favors-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-biden-criticized-for-his-handling-of-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">botched withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer</a>, or to a general sense among some conservative voters that even the military can’t be trusted under a Democratic president. “The culture wars have become so heavily partisan that they now spill over into institutions that previously were thought of as not partisan at all,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-the-stimulus-checks-a-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-still-doesnt-know-how-to-track-a-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public health</a> responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, meanwhile, may have convinced more Americans that the government simply doesn’t know what it’s doing. <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/carman_katherine_grace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Carman</a>, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, was one of the authors of <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA112-7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2020 report</a> that examined why Americans trust institutions in the first place. “Competence and honesty — these are really important factors that contribute to trust,” she said. “We ask the government to make and enforce laws and policy for us. So we need them to be truthful about the information they’re providing. And we want them to have the skills and knowledge to actually do those things.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-trust-the-cdc-on-covid-19-trump-not-so-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, Americans said they generally trusted the government to handle the crisis and share accurate information about it. Their confidence in Trump’s response to the pandemic <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-coronavirus/trumps-handling-of-coronavirus-pandemic-hits-record-low-approval-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN26T3OF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eroded over the remaining year</a>, but when Biden came into office, approval of his handling of the pandemic was pretty high. Now, though, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s approval tracker for presidents' COVID-19 response</a>, 49 percent of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the pandemic and 43 percent disapprove.<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> And <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/biden-starts-year-two-with-diminished-public-support-and-a-daunting-list-of-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew Research Center poll</a> from earlier this year found that a declining share of Americans are confident that Biden is able to handle the public health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that he has good judgment on economic policy, reflecting widespread public concern about rising inflation and a possible recession.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These shifts are happening among Americans of all political stripes, although to different degrees. The Gallup poll found that Democrats’ confidence in the institution of the presidency fell from 69 percent in 2021 to 51 percent this year — an alarming drop among members of Biden’s own party. That tracks, overall, with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-have-been-souring-on-biden-since-last-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a broader erosion in Biden’s support</a> among Democrats, many of whom are disappointed about his administration’s lack of policy achievements and increasingly frustrated about rising costs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The danger, Carman said, is that Americans’ trust in institutions doesn’t just decline — mistrust starts to grow. Her report found that there was already active mistrust of the government and media. “I think that’s particularly worrisome,” she said. “Active distrust means not only do you think they’re not always honest — maybe they lie to you. Maybe they’re trying to hurt you.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Widespread distrust can be dangerous. If people don’t trust government institutions, they’ll be more likely to believe that elections are untrustworthy too. Drezner said that as distrust increases, people are more likely to act in disruptive or even violent ways, like with the Jan. 6 insurrection. If Americans believe the institutions around them are failing, he said, they “might be tempted to take a risky gamble that puts you back to where you used to be.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s a bleak outlook. But Americans are in a bleak mood. Drezner said that if some of the trends that are sowing deeper distrust turn around — say, the pandemic fades into the background and inflation begins to abate — people might start to feel better about the government too. But for now, they’re not feeling happy about most of the institutions that order society — and that could be bad for democracy.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A majority of Americans said the second COVID-19 booster definitely (40 percent) or probably (19 percent) should be available to all adults, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2022/07/06/0048e/1">according to a YouGov poll</a> conducted Wednesday. This includes 83 percent of Democrats but only 42 percent of Republicans. Views didn’t vary too much by age, although older Americans were more likely to feel strongly that the second booster should be available to more people: 47 percent of those ages 65 and over believed everyone should “definitely” have the option, versus only 34 percent of those between the ages of 18-29. At present, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html">CDC guidelines</a> suggest the second booster for only immunocompromised people 12 and older as well as all adults 50 and older. </li><li>Sixty-three percent of Americans were worried about their individual financial outlook in the short-term future, <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/medicare-negotiation-tackling-price-gouging-taxing-the-wealthy-seen-as-effective-to-fight-inflation/">according to a June 23-27 survey from Navigator Research</a>. White Americans (69 percent) appeared to be the most concerned, although Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders weren’t far behind (64 percent). Meanwhile, a smaller share of Hispanic Americans (51 percent) and Black Americans (44 percent) reported feeling uneasy in this regard. This split among racial and ethnic groups is consistent among Americans when it comes to their overall opinions on the current economy: White Americans (83 percent) expressed the most pessimism about the economy, followed by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (79 percent), Hispanic Americans (68 percent) and Black Americans (61 percent). </li><li>With primaries well underway and an increasing spotlight on November’s midterm elections, just over half of Americans (53 percent) wanted political fundraising emails to count as spam, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/07/06/0048e/3">per a YouGov survey</a> conducted this week. More than Democrats and Republicans, independents drove the result, with 62 percent saying they wanted this sort of email classified as spam. </li><li>Support for the congressional hearings on the Jan. 6 insurrection rose over the past month, per <a href="https://projectdefenddemocracy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/American-Public-Opinion_-January-6-and-Efforts-to-Thwart-Will-of-American-Voters.pdf">research recently published by the Defend Democracy Project</a>, which studied one poll conducted May 13-16 by Politico/Morning Consult and another conducted June 11-19 by Lake Research Partners/Research Collaborative/ASO Communications. Sixty-three percent of Americans were in favor of the hearings in June (shortly after they began), up from 55 percent in May. That increase reflects considerably more support from independents — 53 percent in May versus 73 percent in June. Democratic support for the hearings was 94 percent in June, whereas Republican support was just 30 percent.</li><li>A majority of Democrats (80 percent) said the EPA should have the ability to create environmental protections even if those protections harmed industries, according to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/01/prioritize-environment-economy-splits-americans">a survey from The Economist/YouGov</a> published last week. But that number drops to 48 percent among independents and just 28 percent among Republicans.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Talking with voters about reproductive health issues, including abortion access, isn’t new for <a href="https://www.womenengaged.org/staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malika Redmond</a>, the co-founder and CEO of Women Engaged, an Atlanta-based group that focuses on Black voter engagement. Not long after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973, access to reproductive care was harmed by the passage of the Hyde Amendment, which <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned the use of federal funds for most abortions</a>. This, Redmond told me, disproportionately impacted women and young people from perpetually disenfranchised and rural communities, particularly Black women and other women and young adults of color.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Georgia <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-funding-abortion-under-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was among 33 states</a> that banned the use of state Medicaid funds for abortions, following federal guidance. And, by 2017, some <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/factsheet/sfaa-ga.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95 percent of counties in Georgia</a> had no clinics that provided abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Fifty-five percent of women in Georgia lived in these counties. The situation further deteriorated in 2019, when Gov. Brian Kemp signed a controversial bill that would effectively ban most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. At that point, Redmond said, her group started hearing more from people who wanted to understand the fate of reproductive health care in Georgia. That question is once again on the minds of Black voters in Georgia, as the Supreme Court has overturned Roe, and that six-week ban, which was <a href="https://time.com/5866714/georgia-heartbeat-abortion-law-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down by the courts in 2020,</a><em> </em>is now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/24/abortion-state-laws-criminalization-roe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to go into effect soon</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, access to reproductive health care, and the impact that its loss will have on people’s everyday lives, was always top of mind not just for Georgia’s Black voters, but also for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-women-south-bracing-roes-fall-decades-rcna27097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black voters across the U.S.</a> It’s why, as we head into this fall’s midterms, <a href="https://seattlemedium.com/roe-decision-could-spur-massive-voter-turnout-during-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of pro-Black advocacy groups</a> have said that Black voters might view November’s midterm elections as a referendum on abortion access — a wish that some <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-democrats-aim-to-make-abortion-rights-a-unifying-midterm-message/T7NZXR7O5BBPVMHAYMXTQMZ5IM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic politicians are banking on</a>, too. But according to <a href="http://polisci.emory.edu/home/people/biography/gillespie-andra.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andra Gillespie</a>, a professor of political science at Emory University, “[I]t’s hard to say that Black voters are single-issue abortion voters. I think it’ll be couched in a mix of other things important to them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If history has taught us anything, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/black-and-hispanic-people-have-the-most-to-lose-if-roe-is-overturned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is that Black people</a>, particularly those who are poor, will be among the biggest sufferers in a post-Roe world despite some anti-abortion advocates claiming that banning abortion <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/19/16906928/black-anti-abortion-movement-yoruba-richen-medical-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be <em>good</em> for Black people</a>. But it’s unclear whether Black voters will prioritize Roe over issues like <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-8d17-dd36-a38c-cf5faa320000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising prices, the economy or police violence</a>. Moreover, it might be harder for Black voters across the nation to discuss one-size-fits-all abortion policies without first acknowledging how their communities have been disproportionally hurt by things like <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/black-disparities-youth-incarceration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high youth incarceration rates</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased maternal mortality rates</a> and a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of educational opportunities</a> for their children.  </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/overturning-roe-means-abortion-access-us-fivethirtyeight-85676655</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">“I think race-related issues are far more existential for African Americans, and they’re going to emphasize those issues and decisions,” Gillespie told me. “They’re going to have to figure out how to make peace with how their views on those issues fits with their overall views on abortion access.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least when it comes to support for abortion rights and access, though, some polls suggest that Black voters are more supportive than white voters, said <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tresa Undem</a>, a co-founder of the nonpartisan research firm PerryUndem. In a <a href="https://perryundem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PerryUndem-Abortion-Public-Opinion-Survey-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February survey</a> of registered voters, her firm found that Black voters (58 percent) were among the most likely to support a candidate who supports abortion access. Moreover, at 79 percent, Black voters were the racial group <em>most</em> likely to say they did not<em> </em>want to see Roe overturned. (Asian American and Pacific Islander voters came in second at 75 percent, and just 60 percent of white voters said the same.)</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-dealt-big-blow-separation-church-state-85886797</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">This is in line with other polling that has found Black voters becoming more<em> </em>liberal on abortion — even if they’re not naming it as their top policy issue. A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/318932/black-americans-abortion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a> survey conducted between 2017 and 2020 found that 46 percent of Black Americans said that abortion was “morally acceptable” — up from 31 percent who said the same between 2001 and 2007; non-Black racial groups that Gallup surveyed reported a slight change in how they felt about abortion (41 percent from 2001 to 2007, to 43 percent from 2017 to 2020). And another poll from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/chart/views-on-abortion-by-race-and-ethnicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> published in May found that a greater share of Black adults (67 percent) than Hispanic and white adults (58 and 57 percent, respectively) thought abortion should be legal in all or most cases. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On their face, these numbers suggest that abortion access — or a lack thereof — might motivate Black voters to turn out. After all, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-americans-stand-on-abortion-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the share of women getting abortions</a> who is nonwhite (including Black women) <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also steadily grown</a> since the 1970s. But there are plenty of reasons why it won’t be a standalone issue for them. Namely, for many Black people, the debate over abortion access is inextricably tied to race — and access to equal opportunities once a child is born — in ways that white communities seldom face. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, pregnant Black people face worse health outcomes, such as higher <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/disparities-pregnancy-related-deaths/infographic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal and infant mortality</a> rates, which inevitably shape how abortion access is discussed in Black communities. A 2021 <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/58/6/2019/265968/The-Pregnancy-Related-Mortality-Impact-of-a-Total" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study from Duke University</a>, for example, suggested that a hypothetical total abortion ban would increase deaths the most among Black people the most compared to other racial groups. The study estimated that pregnancy-related deaths among Black people would increase by 33 percent in the years following an abortion ban, compared with a 21 percent increase for the overall population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But abortion access in Black communities isn’t just tied to health outcomes; it’s often tied to things like the quality of schools in predominately Black areas, racial disparities in health care or even the criminal justice system. That February PerryUndem survey found, for example, that Black voters connected abortion rights and access to control over one’s body (72 percent), women’s rights (72 percent) and health care (67 percent). A plurality of Black respondents — 47 percent — tied abortion access to racial justice, more than any other demographic group surveyed. And, of course, underlying the debate regarding Roe is the question of what banning abortions means for Black children. Rallying cries for change such as “Black Lives Matter,” a motto and movement created to highlight the abuses that Black people face at the hands of police officers, confronts difficult questions about the safety of both Black people and the children they may be forced to conceive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At its core, this issue for voters is about power and control over one’s own body. Given our nation’s history, I think Black voters across political ideology are more attuned than white people to threats to bodily autonomy,” Undem said. She added that her research has found that Black voters and people of color are more likely to see systemic factors affecting abortion access — because abortion access is about access to resources and opportunities to raise healthy children. As Undem told me, Black voters and people of color often see a lack of abortion access as “forcing people to have children, but not providing access to resources that are required, like affordable child care.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, losing access to safe abortions isn’t the only thing Black voters have to worry about. The Supreme Court may soon rule on a number of cases that could further strip away civil rights. Earlier this year, the high court agreed to decide <a href="https://ncpolicywatch.com/2022/03/31/upcoming-u-s-supreme-court-cases-could-curb-colleges-use-of-affirmative-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether race-based admissions programs</a> are lawful, raising questions about the future of affirmative action in higher education. The court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also considering a challenge</a> to Alabama’s congressional map which argues that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — one of the most important safeguards against racial discrimination in elections — requires a second seat in which Black voters can elect the candidate of their choice. If that law is weakened, our elections would lose one of their biggest protections against racial discrimination.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, it’s hard to conclude that Roe will be the sole motivating factor bringing Black voters to the polls this fall. That’s because, as Redmond and Gillespie told me, Black voters, like all racial voting blocs, are neither a monolith nor single-issue voters. But it’s also possible that Roe’s fate brings more voters to the polls <em>because </em>it’s wrapped up in a number of racial and economic justice issues that Black communities also care about. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Nobody wants any rights to be taken,” Redmond said, adding that issues like abortion access are important, but wrapped “inside of a set of civil and human rights issues” that are key to ensuring Black Americans’ safety, as well as economic and racial justice. “These are all key to Black communities thriving.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Do state courts have the power to interpret their own state constitutions? The Supreme Court could be poised to say “no” — at least when it comes to redistricting and election law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/06/justices-will-hear-case-that-tests-power-of-state-legislatures-to-set-rules-for-federal-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to hear</a> the case Moore v. Harper in the coming fall term. In that case, Republican legislators in North Carolina are asking the court to overturn the <em>state</em> Supreme Court’s decision to throw out their <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/north-carolina-republicans-passed-a-heavily-skewed-congressional-map-how-will-the-courts-respond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gerrymandered congressional map</a> and impose <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the court’s own</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Their argument rests on an extreme reading of the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elections clause</a> of the U.S. Constitution that <a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5885&amp;context=flr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posits</a> that only state legislatures and Congress have the authority to decide how federal elections are run. Under this school of thought, known as the “<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent state legislature</a>” theory, state courts would no longer be able to intervene — even when a legislature violated the state’s constitution, as was found to be the case in North Carolina.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The independent state legislature theory is <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer than 25 years old</a>, and for most of its life, it’s been relegated to the fringes of academia. But it was widely promoted by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/05/20/ginni-thomas-arizona-election-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump and his allies</a> as <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4041062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they attempted</a> to first undermine — <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-pennsylvania-suit-now-suggests-legislature-pick-winner-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and</a> then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/us/politics/john-eastman-trump-2020-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn</a> — the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And several Supreme Court justices have already suggested that they’re on board with the theory. During litigation over election laws in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/20-542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a66_new_m6io.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a> in 2020, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch endorsed some version of the idea that state legislatures should have nearly unfettered power over how federal elections are run, and earlier this year, they said in an emergency-docket ruling that they would have <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a455_5if6.pdf#page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled in favor</a> of the North Carolina legislature.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">If the Supreme Court sides with North Carolina Republicans in this case, it would have massive implications for election law. Depending on how the court rules, state courts might no longer be allowed to strike down legislatures’ proposed congressional maps for being gerrymandered. And if this happens, the way American elections are conducted would change in dramatic and destabilizing ways. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/thomas-wolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Wolf</a>, deputy director of the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, said ruling for the North Carolina Legislature would be “stepping into an arrangement of election law that has never governed the country.” An extreme embrace of the theory by the Supreme Court would hand legislatures power over every aspect of how federal elections are run, to the exclusion of not only state courts but also possibly other state actors like governors and election administrators. “It would be a voter suppressor’s fever dream,” Wolf said.</p>



<h2><strong>Partisan gerrymandering could get much more extreme</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">First and foremost, if North Carolina Republicans prevail at the Supreme Court, state courts would lose some of their power to curtail gerrymandering — or maybe all of it. If the court accepts the independent state legislature theory but rules narrowly, it could allow state courts to overturn maps but not redraw them, according to <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-i-vladeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Vladeck</a>, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “The idea is that there are certain things state courts can’t do,” Vladeck said. “So a state court could look at the legislature’s map and say, ‘Nope, try again.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But several more extreme paths are possible too. One option is that state courts might be barred from overturning maps based on vague sections of their state constitutions — like an equal protection clause — which would hamstring their ability to intervene in many states. Or the Supreme Court might simply rule that state courts can’t get involved in partisan gerrymandering disputes at all. That would directly contradict a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 ruling</a> where the court’s Republican appointees said that federal courts couldn’t hear challenges to partisan gerrymandering,<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal courts still have the ability to throw out maps that are racially gerrymandered, but &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-v-milligan-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another case&lt;/a&gt; pending before the Supreme Court, regarding the Voting Rights Act, threatens to &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;undermine those protections as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> but they explicitly noted that state courts were still free to intervene. But the court is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-partisan-divide-hasnt-been-this-sharp-in-generations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more conservative than it was then</a>, which means there might be a majority to turn around and limit state courts’ power.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could mean a lot more work for the federal courts — exactly the kind of work that the justices said three years ago that they <em>didn’t</em> want federal judges to be doing. But it would also likely result in much more aggressive and unfair gerrymanders. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/final-ish-map-congressional-districts-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85543675</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past year, state courts have struck down congressional maps in not only North Carolina but also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/25/maryland-congressional-map-thrown-out-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ohios-overturned-congressional-map-shows-how-lawsuits-might-scramble-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a>. If all of those rulings are invalidated, it would result in eight additional seats that lean at least 5 percentage points toward the legislature’s party, five fewer seats that lean at least 5 percentage points toward the opposition party and three fewer highly competitive seats.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the partisan upshot, it would result in two additional Democratic-leaning seats and one more Republican-leaning seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> More importantly, it would also embolden legislatures in other states — knowing their maps wouldn’t be subject to judicial review — to draw more extreme gerrymanders in the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A ruling in favor of the independent state legislature theory could also jeopardize state redistricting commissions. A lot depends on the scope of the ruling, said <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/experts/ethan-herenstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethan Herenstein</a>, counsel with the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, but embracing the idea that state legislatures have sole control over the redistricting process could imperil those commissions’ authority — even though the court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/arizona-state-legislature-v-arizona-independent-redistricting-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upheld their constitutionality in 2015</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If the court eliminates redistricting commissions, gerrymandering would dramatically increase. During this past redistricting cycle, commissions enacted 10 congressional maps containing 125 congressional districts, and those maps were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-redistricting-commissions-live-up-to-their-promise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally much fairer than legislatures’ maps</a>: Commission-enacted maps of at least three congressional districts had an average <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficiency gap</a> of just 6 percentage points toward the party they favored, while legislature-enacted maps of at least three districts had an average efficiency gap of 16 percentage points.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But if those commission-enacted maps were suddenly rendered null and void, the court would actually give Democrats a major political boost. Out of those 125 districts, 84 are in states where Democrats would control the redistricting process, and 28-41 are in states where Republicans would (depending on whether governors still have veto power over new maps). Of course, these numbers may change after the 2022 elections, though probably not by much. Thanks in part to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-redistricting-affects-the-battle-for-state-legislatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the way their maps are drawn</a>, very few legislatures are <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to be competitive</a> this year.</p>



<h2><strong>The country’s whole system for federal elections could change</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the impact wouldn’t stop at redistricting. The Constitution’s elections clause also covers every aspect of how federal elections are run. That includes the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/voting-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">56 voting restrictions passed since the 2020 election</a> — laws that require ID in order to vote, discourage absentee voting, move up voter deadlines, cut early voting, purge voters from the rolls and ban giving food and water to voters waiting in line. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">State courts are already <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-litigation-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing challenges</a> to several such laws, but those could all get kneecapped if the Supreme Court fully embraces the independent state legislature theory. For example, in 2021, a state court <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-25c1633fd815ae57ca6c703a45c9d636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> North Carolina’s voter-ID law, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/nh-supreme-court-to-issue-ruling-in-sb-3-voter-registration-law-appeal-friday/36908393#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> a law imposing burdensome proof-of-residency requirements on people without an ID who register to vote within 30 days of an election. These laws might very well go back into effect after a ruling in favor of North Carolina’s Legislature in Moore v. Harper.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, courts would not be able to unilaterally change federal election laws in an emergency, like the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pa-supreme-court-extends-mail-in-ballot-deadlines-to-3-days-after-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania Supreme Court did in 2020</a> when it extended the deadline for absentee ballots to be received amid <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/usps-mail-in-ballot-guidelines-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread delays in postal service</a>. “​​If the state legislature says, ‘Polls close at 7 p.m.,’ and on Election Day, there’s a hurricane and the [state] Supreme Court says, ‘Keep them open until 10,’ the legislature wins,” Vladeck said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A sweeping ruling could also remove election officials’ discretion over how to administer elections, creating chaos on the ground. Right now, for instance, secretaries of state and local election officials make lots of decisions, big and small, so that elections run smoothly. But the independent state legislature theory could hand those decisions to legislators who often don’t work full-time and who have much less knowledge about the thousands of minute details that govern elections. “Elections are way too complex for legislators to legislate every single nook and cranny,” Herenstein said. But an extreme ruling in this case could, he said, “stop or slow state legislatures from even voluntarily sharing their power with election administrators.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This would not only endanger programs that election officials have enacted of their own accord, like Colorado’s, Connecticut’s and Georgia’s implementation of <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic voter registration</a>. It would also tie their hands in emergencies. For example, in 2020, officials in at least 41 states made executive decisions to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loosen election regulations</a> and encourage people to vote by mail amid the COVID-19 pandemic — everything from <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/05/19/all-michigan-voters-get-absentee-ballot-applications-in-mail/5218266002/?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailing voters absentee-ballot applications</a> to <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/07/merrill-extends-covid-19-emergency-absentee-voting-rule-to-general-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counting COVID-19 as a valid excuse to vote absentee</a> to <a href="https://dos.myflorida.com/communications/press-releases/2020/public-notice-secretary-of-state-laurel-m-lee-provides-update-about-voter-registration-in-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extending voter-registration deadlines</a> to <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/absentee-drop-boxes-in-georgia-here-through-november-election/85-ac62bf26-b56e-4960-9ba5-67f8863e9976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting up ballot drop boxes</a> to <a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2020/03/24/carney-moves-primary-election-june-2/2911534001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postponing entire primaries</a>. This may no longer be possible come 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Trump allies have also argued that the independent state legislature theory empowers legislatures to appoint an alternate set of state electors — which, in 2020, could have overturned the presidential election. However, <a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/leah-litman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leah Litman</a>, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said that it’s important to remember that even the independent state legislature theory doesn’t mean state legislatures would be <em>completely</em> unchecked, because the U.S. Constitution would still apply. But she added that part of what alarms her about the theory is that it’s so unclear what embracing it would actually do. “It’s just kind of a mess,” she said of the theory. “We really don’t know what it would look like.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also don’t know what the court will do. Three justices — Thomas, Gorsuch and Alito — seem likely to embrace the theory and rule in favor of the North Carolina Legislature since they already said that’s what they thought the court should do. Another Republican-appointed justice, Brett Kavanaugh, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a455_5if6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> earlier this year that the issue was “important” and that “both sides have advanced serious arguments on the merits,” which suggests that he’s at least open to the idea. It’s far from clear that there are five votes to sign onto the independent state legislature theory — but at least some of the conservative justices seem to be on board already.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">A year ago, Rep. Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20534328-banks-working-class-memo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a memo</a> to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy about how he thought the Republican Party should work to keep the coalition that had voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Republicans, he thought, could “permanently become the Party of the Working Class.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was a paradigm shift, he argued, and embracing it would be key to Republicans winning back the House and Senate in the midterm elections. “After five years,” he said, “it’s clear this reversal isn’t a temporary realignment contingent on Donald Trump’s presence in the White House — both parties are undergoing coalitional transformations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Democrats, meanwhile, memos on how to hold on to or win back the working class are perennial favorites from <a href="https://democracycorps.com/focus-group-reports/getting-heard-by-our-discontented-working-class-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollsters</a> and <a href="https://www.greenbergresearch.com/his-thinking/democrats-win-working-class-new-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategists</a>. This has been especially true during the midterm cycle as Democrats sound the alarm that their party is out of touch with their constituents. “The starting point for the strategy is seeing that both our base and our target persuasion audiences are working-class and struggling, and we see them and wear their shoes,” the longtime pollster Stanley Greenberg <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/polling-how-democrats-can-win-back-working-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a polling memo in November</a>. What’s left unsaid but is heavily implied in these appeals, though, is that Democrats are primarily concerned with losing the <em>white</em> working class.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These voters are the focus of key Senate races in Pennsylvania and Ohio, two states where the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016. President Biden narrowly won back Pennsylvania in 2020, but Ohio remained unattainable. Yet Democrats are following similar playbooks: In Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is <a href="https://johnfetterman.com/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about unions</a>, and in Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan is promising to raise <a href="https://timforoh.com/issues/cutting-workers-in-on-the-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the minimum wage and expand child care</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/california-primary-races-watch-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85222569</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">These messages, though, are unlikely to work on their own because the dividing line in the American electorate is not economics; it’s race and culture. Democratic strategists often point to Barack Obama’s presidency and his response to the Great Recession as a turning point for the party’s appeals to working-class white people. After all, Obama <a href="https://www.270towin.com/2008_Election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won many of the Rust Belt states</a> partly on the strength of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/upshot/why-trump-won-working-class-whites.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white working-class vote</a>, but after his presidency, many of those voters <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/11/trump-won-a-lot-of-white-working-class-obama-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned to Trump and the Republican Party</a>. That’s because Obama’s presidency marked another big turning point in American society: a step toward greater racial equity. And on this issue, Democrats and Republicans could not be further apart. It’s why Democratic appeals to win back the working class are unlikely to work, too.</p>



<h2><strong>The parties’ pitches</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/building-a-stronger-fairer-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Party’s 2020 platform</a>, “building a stronger, fairer economy” was the <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second item listed</a>, after strategies to deal with COVID-19, and it sounded a populist note: that the American economy is tilted toward corporations and the wealthy, and that it’s harder than ever for Americans to move up the economic ladder. “Americans deserve an economy that works for everyone — not just for the wealthy and the well-connected,” their platform reads. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, Biden’s COVID-19 relief bill focused largely on the economy and passed soon after he took office. They’ve also concentrated on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/06/27/manchin-schumer-build-back-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other priorities</a> meant to help middle-class families financially, including an effort that would expand the child tax credit and help families pay for child care and extend subsidies for health insurance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, the agenda Banks laid out in his memo to McCarthy centers on nationalistic policies and cultural issues — not necessarily economic ones. For instance, Banks devotes an entire category to “Anti-Wokeness,” writing, “Nothing better encapsulates Democrats’ elitism and classism than their turn towards ‘wokeness.’” And the first item on his list is immigration. But even when the memo does turn to the economy, in its section on trade, Banks largely makes an anti-China argument. “President Trump’s push to take on the Chinese Communist Party resonated because voters felt, correctly, that the Communist Party harmed American jobs more than any other foreign government.” Likewise, Banks’s point during a section on “Main Street vs Wall Street” is to rail against the COVID-19 shutdown policies and not point to any economic differences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s clear from the two parties’ approaches is that Republicans mainly think of the working class as a cultural and racial identity, and not an economic one. Democrats, to be sure, are also leaning into a cultural appeal when they pitch themselves to working-class voters — primarily a populist appeal bent on uniting the working class against corporate greed — but it is still rooted more in economics than any national culture-war issue.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One struggle for Democrats in this messaging war is that cultural and ethnic identities have traditionally mattered more to Americans than class identity. “America is the only country that never had a mass socialist movement or a really successful labor movement on the level of even Canada, much less Europe,” said David Brady, a <a href="https://bradydave.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside</a>. “So I think that America has a sort of skittishness or reluctance to embrace its social class solidarity.” Americans are somewhat divided on class politics: Most say unions have had a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/03/majorities-of-americans-say-unions-have-a-positive-effect-on-u-s-and-that-decline-in-union-membership-is-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive effect on American life</a>, but many are also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/07/in-their-own-words-behind-americans-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skeptical of socialism</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/working-class-anger-fuels-trump-popularity-in-wisconsin/3260796.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some</a> Democratic <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/democrats-speak-to-working-class-discontent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategists</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/03/frank-rich-no-sympathy-for-the-hillbilly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pundits</a> have <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/the-perfect-storm-working-class-voters-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Trump was successful because he recognized the anger that the working classes have felt since the Great Recession and because he then channeled it, even if he didn’t have the policies to match. The Democratic strategists, though, argue that they do have such policies. And indeed, legislation like the COVID-19 recovery bill <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-help-democrats-avoid-a-midterm-defeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been popular</a>. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/03/09/broad-public-support-for-coronavirus-aid-package-just-a-third-say-it-spends-too-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seventy percent of adults</a> were in favor of it, including even 41 percent of Republicans. However, Biden’s popularity has dropped <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">below 40 percent</a> since then, and Republicans are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored to reclaim the House</a>. These policies on their own just aren’t enough to break through an increasingly divided country. </p>

Tim Ryan has tried to center his Senate campaign on workers in Ohio, but he faces an uphill battle against Republican nominee J.D. Vance. <p>Matthew Hatcher / Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Who is the “working class”?</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of the problem for Democrats is that since Trump’s election, the definition of “working class” — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/23/readers-reply-what-do-the-terms-working-class-and-middle-class-actually-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already a squishy term</a> — has <a href="https://www.demos.org/research/understanding-working-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely come to be defined</a> as people who haven’t graduated from college, especially when it refers to white people. The issue with this definition is that it constitutes the vast majority of Americans: Only about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/02/22/new-from-us-census-bureau-number-of-americans-with-a-bachelors-degree-continues-to-grow/?sh=4afe946b7bbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third of adults</a> in the country over the age of 25 hold a bachelor’s degree, including about 36 percent of white, non-Hispanic people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, while it’s generally true that not having a college degree leads to lower average earnings than having one, that broad assessment <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/collegepayoff2021/#resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is not always true</a>. (The amount a college degree pays off <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/college-pays-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also varies by race</a> and gender.) It misses groups like small-business owners, who may not have gone to college but whose incomes vary widely. In fact, some blue-collar workers, like those employed in the natural gas industry, might have upper-middle-class income levels. In these cases, the economic threats they often see are from Democrats to their industries, not to their own finances, which is why messaging about the government’s role in helping struggling families can fall flat with them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In general, Trump and the Republican Party have solidified a base of support <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2018-12/Grinnell%20College%20National%20Poll_Nov18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in rural areas</a>, which are overwhelmingly white and have lower rates of college attainment than the country as a whole, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/employment-education/rural-education/#:~:text=Educational%20Attainment,-While%20the%20overall&amp;text=Over%20the%20same%20period%2C%20the,at%2035%20percent%20in%202019." target="_blank" rel="noopener">at just 21 percent</a>. But understanding class divisions in rural America is challenging. <a href="https://slate.com/business/2016/05/small-business-owners-have-a-thing-for-donald-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small-business owners</a> and county leaders, for instance, seem to have supported Trump in just as high numbers as their lower-earning neighbors. Moreover, because fewer people with a bachelor’s degree live in rural counties overall, non-college-educated workers are just more likely to make up the middle class there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If you have enough money to buy a truck and have enough money to feed your family and have a four-person house, you’re certainly not struggling,” said Daniel Laurison, a sociologist at Swarthmore College. But Republicans and Trump, according to Laurison, have used confusion around class to their advantage. “Being a white person without a college degree makes you a ‘regular guy,’” said Laurison. “It doesn’t make you economically disadvantaged.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there’s still a tendency, especially among college-educated, urban workers, to assume that those kinds of cultural differences indicate a different class position and that it’s rural voters’ class position — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/20/trump-made-a-connection-here-rural-supporters-iowa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not their cultural attitudes</a> — driving their votes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this takes it as a given that the long-term trends in economic outcomes, which have affected many Americans, are what Trump’s voters are responding to. This line of thinking, though, ignores other changes in American life and politics, such as an increase in global trade, a shift toward knowledge work instead of blue-collar labor, a relatively new emphasis on sending students to college and a more expansive view of rights and equalities for racial, ethnic and gender minorities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These rifts in the kind of work that people do, the lives they live, who their neighbors are and what they think is important are what the educational divide might be picking up as much as income. “We certainly see a lot of mistrust of the elites, of people in positions of power, business leaders and elected leaders,” said Jeffrey Jones, senior editor of Gallup. “Education is a split [that] … we hadn’t seen before.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When Trump voters are interviewed about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/why-did-people-vote-for-donald-trump-us-voters-explain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">why they supported him</a>, they highlight gun rights, abortion, America’s standing in the world and anti-Obama and anti-Clinton sentiment. It’s, in part, why Republicans continue to attack the cultural elite, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/us/trump-ivy-league-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elite colleges</a> to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37722897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington elite,</a> in their messages. They know this resonates with their base as there’s ample evidence that Trump voters’ anxiety is more about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/existential-anxiety-not-poverty-motivates-trump-support/558674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial and gender equality and America’s standing in the world</a> than it is about economic equality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In reality, voters who rank the economy as their top concern <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voters-who-think-the-economy-is-the-countrys-biggest-problem-are-pretty-trumpy-that-might-not-help-him-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be richer, whiter and more Republican-leaning already</a>, and their economic concerns very likely come from a different viewpoint than a class-based grievance sparked by inequality.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In his bid for a Senate seat in Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan is making his appeal to voters based, in part, on a <a href="https://timforoh.com/issues/cutting-workers-in-on-the-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> to raise the minimum wage and expand child care access. But his argument also has an <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1508795783210016772?s=20&amp;t=gYnwnM2Aqbhl34toezxDxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-China component</a>, which sparked criticism <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/04/04/facing-criticism-tim-ryan-defends-anti-china-ad-in-ohio-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from other Democrats for using the “hate” and “fear”</a> of the Republican playbook. Additionally, in his first ad against J.D. Vance, his Republican opponent, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1521665423430893568?s=20&amp;t=DxLOG9C8uTf2fDyz_Qt5AQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan struck a populist chord, criticizing Vance</a> for having left Ohio for San Francisco “to make millions and invest in companies that profit from globalization and free trade.” Ryan says all this while sitting at a diner. “[Vance] became a celebrity, CNN analyst and a big hit at Washington cocktail parties,” says Ryan.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s hard to see how these cultural attacks, normally made by Republicans against Democrats, will work. For starters, the facts of Vance’s post-Ohio life might not matter as much as the basics of his biography — he served in the military and first became famous for writing a book about his Appalachian grandparents. Moreover, as a candidate, he hasn’t shied away from <a href="https://youtu.be/K3qYJoSV0lI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly nationalistic, anti-Latino</a> appeals. According to Laurison, the elite thing doesn’t stick either, “because [Vance is] not part of the ‘cultural elite’ in the same way.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Pennsylvania, Fetterman is a slightly different case. He’s served as mayor of a Rust Belt town and as a lieutenant governor with just-a-dude authenticity. But the voters who put Biden over the top in 2020 were largely the voters for whom the Democratic message is already appealing or suburban voters who found Trump off-putting. It’s true that Fetterman won the primary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/17/us/elections/results-pennsylvania-us-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pretty much everywhere</a> — and handily — but he lacked support from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/us/politics/conor-lamb-pennsylvania-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic establishment</a>, and it’s unclear whether he can win over more moderate, suburban voters in the general election. Polls show time and again that lower-middle-class voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vote</a> for Democrats, while <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white voters of all income levels vote for Republicans</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s also some evidence that Democratic voters want their party to also concentrate on social issues: A <a href="https://democracycorps.com/focus-group-reports/getting-heard-by-our-discontented-working-class-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy Corps focus group</a> from May found that Democratic voters positively associated Democrats with “equality; civil liberties and rights; empathy; civil rights; police reform; social issues; and focus on the environment.” The issue on economics and on social issues, the memo said, was that “Democrats always ‘disappoint.’ They promise big change and nothing happens.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is at odds with the advice of strategists like David Shor. “[T]he way we get around [ideological polarization] is by talking a lot about progressive goals that are not ideologically polarizing, goals that we share with self-described conservatives and moderates,” Shor, a Democratic data scientist, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/david-shor-2020-democrats-autopsy-hispanic-vote-midterms-trump-gop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told New York Magazine last March</a>. “Even among nonwhite voters, those tend to be economic issues.” But this assumes that voters will forget about the party alignments that are deeply entrenched.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When Democrats lament a bygone era in which they won the working-class vote, they are primarily talking about the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt— a time when the economy was radically shifted toward worker and labor power. But that was also a time when policies meant to favor the working class were specifically designed to help white men. The relative position of many people in the economy — and society at large — has shifted, and if that’s what Republican voters are responding to, messages of economic justices and <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/abetterdeal/higher-wages-and-better-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveling the playing field</a> for all workers won’t change that. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">In last week’s Jan. 6 congressional hearing, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson outlined the days leading up to the attack on the U.S. Capitol and testified that then-President Donald Trump and some people in his administration were aware of the threat of violence. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how this hearing could affect Americans’ views of Trump and the Republican nominees running in the midterm who support Trump’s “Big Lie.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The crew also analyzes a <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1696&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new poll</a> from the University of New Hampshire that garnered quite a bit of media attention for complicating the 2024 Republican presidential primaries. And Kaleigh Rogers and Nate Silver compete in an Independence Day-inspired statistics game where they guess how many Americans know the country’s national anthem and how many prefer burgers over hot dogs.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Conservatives got what they wanted from this year’s Supreme Court term — and then some. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a flurry of decisions released at the end of June, the court’s Republican-appointed justices released opinions that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded gun rights</a>, allowed individual public school employees to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-418_i425.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pray on the job</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1088_dbfi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it harder</a> for states to exclude religious schools from public funding programs, and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s power</a> to regulate carbon emissions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was a stunning display of the conservative justices’ power, less than two years after <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-unusually-big-jump-to-the-right-might-look-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> gave former President Donald Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-amy-coney-barrett-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chance to appoint a third justice</a>, leaving the court’s Republican appointees with a six-justice supermajority.  This was the first full term with all three of Trump’s appointees on the court, and at the beginning of the term, we weren’t sure whether they would move incrementally to the right — a tack that <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/07/stuart-gerson-understanding-john-roberts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chief Justice John Roberts prefers</a> — or take a more aggressive approach. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The conservatives answered by delivering the most far-reaching slew of rulings in modern memory. It’s now abundantly clear that Trump’s appointees are in control of this court, and they’re not searching for consensus. In fact, the divide between the court’s Republican and Democratic appointees is deeper than it’s been in the modern era.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Usually, around half of the court’s rulings are unanimous and decisions that pit the conservative and liberal blocs against each other are much rarer. Not this year. According to SCOTUSBlog data analyzed by FiveThirtyEight, 21 percent of rulings were polarized by party of the appointing president, with all Republican appointees voting one way and all Democratic appointees voting the other way, and only 29 percent were unanimous.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the analysis in the chart below, we used categorizations from the Supreme Court Database in combination with SCOTUSBlog to determine when justices agreed and dissented, including cases where justices agreed in part and dissented in part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> </p>

There have always been ideological disagreements among the justices, and those have often pitted liberals against conservatives, but those divides weren’t consistently linked to the justice’s appointing party. For instance, former justices like Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O’Connor were appointed by a Republican president, but broke with their fellow Republican-appointed justices on key issues like separation of church and state, abortion and same-sex marriage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, there really isn’t a “swing” justice. According to preliminary Martin-Quinn scores, a commonly used metric of judicial ideology, Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas anchor the right side of the conservative bloc, while the other conservative-appointed justices are basically indistinguishable from each other. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="970" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1104" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/atd.bronner.SCOTUS-END-OF-TERM-1-mob.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This means that the justices in the center — Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch — are the ones who need to be convinced to join the majority in politically important cases. And although it’s hard to tell from the Martin-Quinn scores, they didn’t agree on everything. The most high-profile division was in Dobbs v. Jackson, the case that overruled abortion rights, where Roberts voted to uphold Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban but not to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gorsuch, meanwhile, had some even sharper disagreements with his fellow Republican appointees. Perhaps most notably, he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-crime-native-americans-oklahoma-congress-98184e0e1d0085690bb340c99b48a90e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissented with the liberals</a> in a case where the other conservatives voted to give states more power over Native American reservations, contradicting the court’s position from just two years earlier. But that case wasn’t an outlier. According to SCOTUSBlog’s data, Gorsuch was in the majority in divided cases 65 percent of the time — only slightly more than liberal Justice Elena Kagan (57 percent). </p>

Alito wrote 21 percent of the opinions in ideologically polarized cases, and Thomas wrote 29 percent — more than any other justices except Roberts (29 percent). That means that together, the two far-right justices wrote half of the polarized opinions, including the decision overruling abortion rights and the decision expanding gun rights. And both Alito and Thomas were in the majority more than they’ve been in the recent past, particularly in divided cases. Alito, for instance, was in the majority in 78 percent of divided cases — up from <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SCOTUSblog-Final-STAT-PACK-OT2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58 percent of divided cases</a> two years ago. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-approval-rating-dropping-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85385158</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The court, meanwhile, isn’t just polarized along partisan lines — its decisions also increasingly align with the views of the average Republican voter. In that sense, the Supreme Court’s tack to the right actually started a year ago — at least, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2120284119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new research</a> from political scientists Stephen Jessee, Neil Malhotra and Maya Sen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In surveys conducted in 2010, 2020 and 2021, the researchers asked Americans what <em>their</em> opinion was about the central issues in the highest-profile cases each term, and then compared their findings to the Supreme Court’s actual rulings. They found that the court’s rulings in 2010 — when Kennedy was the median — fell roughly between liberal respondents and conservative respondents, in the country’s ideological mainstream. Ten years later, in 2020, Roberts had replaced Kennedy as the median, but the court’s decisions were still in that same middle-of-the-road position. But the following year, after Barrett joined the court, its rulings lurched to the right. Rather than falling between Republicans’ and Democrats’ views, its rulings were overall very close to the position of the average Republican respondent.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-gun-ruling-remakes-gun-control-americans-85660014</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The researchers haven’t finished analyzing this year’s data yet. But comparing the justices’ rulings to public opinion is helpful because although it’s clear the court is getting more conservative, it’s harder to quantitatively pin down exactly how conservative it’s become. For example, in 2005, his first year on the court, Roberts was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tied with Alito as the third-most conservative justice</a>. Now, relative to his peers, he’s the sixth-most conservative justice. Does that mean Roberts moved to the left? Or does it mean the court moved to the right? The Martin-Quinn scores can’t tell us. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s important to bear that limitation in mind because this term, the conservative justices didn’t just deliver lots of conservative rulings — they decided lots of cases that dramatically shifted the law to the right. It’s hard to track quantitatively, but cases with a conservative outcome in previous terms likely had more modest effects and didn’t diverge so much from mainstream public opinion, because there wasn’t a clear majority of justices who wanted to do big, sweeping things like overturn Roe v. Wade. So comparing the share of conservative decisions in each term may actually understate the court’s rightward shift quite a bit because many of the cases the court is now hearing are potentially much broader in scope.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, the question is just how far the conservative majority wants to go. In <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year’s end-of-term round-up</a>, we pointed out that in cases in which the conservative justices disagreed, the more centrist group — Roberts, Kavanaugh and Barrett — were driving the direction of decisions. That’s still true, but if the past term is any guide, the two most conservative justices — Alito and Thomas — will have a much more powerful role in the conservative bloc going forward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And over time, it seems likely that the polarization on the court will only deepen as the justices — like the rest of the country — retreat into their ideological camps. Roberts, after all, expressed dissatisfaction with the scope of his fellow Republican appointees’ ruling on abortion — but he wasn’t unhappy enough to join the other side. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A native of Austin, Texas, Hunter Ellinger grew up in <a href="https://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/09-12-16-best-american-cities-liberals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a progressive hotspot</a>. In a recent phone conversation, he recalled his upbringing in the 1950s, when a group of liberal activists — often organized by his mother and father — would repeatedly protest <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/civil-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racist laws</a> passed by the state’s legislature. Ellinger was a teenager at the time and, therefore, unable to vote, but he still remembers feeling “like an anomaly within Texas.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, at 79 years old, those feelings have only intensified. Ellinger still lives in Austin, <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2017/02/17/how-liberal-is-austin/10402757007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Texas’s most liberal cities</a>, and boasts that, in a sense, he’s carried on his mother’s legacy: He was involved in the civil rights movement, the Peace Corps, the 1970s alternative press and participated in a slew of anti-war protests over the last several decades.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’ve voted in every election I’ve ever been able to vote in, which started in 1964, and I’ve always voted Democratic,” Ellinger said, noting that the current party is further to the right than he is. “I would describe myself as half-commie, half-anarchist,” he said. “I want the government and society as a whole to work for everybody, but I also want everybody to be strong enough and free enough to put things together in their own way.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given his political leanings, Ellinger described himself as a “Silent Generation progressive.” But that’s not the norm for voters his age. In fact, Americans in Ellinger’s age group — those over the age of 65 — were the most likely of any age group to say that they approved of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/01/22/by-a-narrow-margin-americans-say-senate-trial-should-result-in-trumps-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Donald Trump’s job performance</a>, and registered voters from his generation were the most likely to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/1-generations-party-identification-midterm-voting-preferences-views-of-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favor Republican candidates</a>, according to the Pew Research Center. And among registered voters, Silent Generation men were <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely than women of the same age</a> to favor Republicans as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is in line with the conventional wisdom that there’s a consistent age gap in our politics today, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/sep/23/older-americans-vote-republican-fact-check-election-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older voters vote red</a> and younger voters veer blue. And there are myriad reasons why this is the case. For one, older Americans are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to be white and religious</a> — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/168083/seniors-realigned-republican-party.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two demographic groups</a> that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/174134/religion-remains-strong-marker-political-identity.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also tend to vote Republican</a>. They’re also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to favor less government intervention</a> and are more prone to believing that increased diversity <em>isn’t </em>a good thing for the country — which is in line with <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/24/17607608/racial-diversity-republicans-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans’ way of thinking</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But these sentiments weren’t shared by the four voters older than 50, including Ellinger, whom I spoke with for this piece. In fact, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many were closer to younger generations</a> — like Gen Z or millennials — when it came to their political beliefs; climate change, racial justice, abortion access and higher wages were among some of the top policy priorities they listed, even if they were skeptical that Congress would address these things in their lifetime. Moreover, even though almost everyone I talked with said they wished the Democratic Party would go further left and support policies championed by, say, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of “The Squad,”</a> a progressive group of Democratic lawmakers made up mainly of women of color, they didn’t begrudge President Biden for not pushing forward a more progressive political agenda, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/progressives-urge-biden-deliver-campaign-promises-dems-struggle-frustrated-base-1653727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as he once promised</a>. Rather, several applauded him for the work he’s done in office post-Trump, but wished the Democratic Party itself would invest more in building a younger, more liberal bench of successors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I do feel like the lack of constant generation change has left Democrats a little stuck,” said Pamela M., a 52-year-old from rural Maryland who preferred to use only her first name and last initial for privacy. “They don’t know how to advertise and haven’t had a great ground-game strategy in a way that a wide swath of people respond to.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that hasn’t deterred Pamela M. — a self-described “Warren Democrat” — from supporting and voting for Democratic candidates over the years. But part of the reason for her loyalty might have less to do with her agreeing with establishment Democrats’ policy priorities and more to do with the fact that, on average, voters over 45 years old (and especially those 65 and older) are the age group most likely to turn out to vote. Since 1996 or so, there’s been a correlation <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1096299/voter-turnout-presidential-elections-by-age-historical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between voter participation and age</a>, and in 2020, almost 72 percent of those ages 65 and over cast a ballot — about 10 percentage points more than the national average. </p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certain polls</a> and <a href="https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/politics/info-2022/shes-the-difference-likely-voters-50-plus-survey-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports by interest groups</a> representing older voters suggest that those over the age of 50 may be slightly competitive as a voting bloc; but on the whole, older voters do <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/sep/23/older-americans-vote-republican-fact-check-election-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lean Republican</a>. In 2016 and 2020, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew’s validated-voter survey</a>, Trump won Silent Generation voters — those born between 1928 and 1945 — by 19- and 16-percentage-point margins, respectively. Meanwhile, baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964 — were more split between Democrats and Republicans, although Trump still narrowly bested Biden and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton among voters in this generation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are always outliers, though. In fact, there’s a small percentage of older Americans who said that they not only lean Democratic — but identify more with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. According to the 2020 <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/E9N6PH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooperative Election Study</a>, about 6 percent of Americans<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses were weighted to match the general adult population of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> born in 1955 or before identified as “very liberal,” 12 percent as “liberal” and another 7 percent as “somewhat liberal.” This compares to roughly 50 percent of Americans born in 1955 or before who said they were “somewhat” or more conservative. But many of the left-of-center voters I spoke with didn’t just identify as liberal, they also said that it was <em>detrimental </em>for other people their age to consistently cast ballots for the GOP.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Typically, the older and wealthier you become, the more likely you are to vote Republican,” said Kathleen Helbing, a 70-year-old living in Indiana and a self-described socialist. “But I don’t know why people vote against their own economic interests. To any old person who votes Republican, especially after [Florida Sen.] Rick Scott put out <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/04/07/democratic-ad-exaggerates-scope-of-rick-scotts-proposal-on-social-security-medicare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this 11-point agenda</a> that discussed potentially sunsetting federal legislation, like Social Security, I think, ‘Are you people out of your mind?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the case for Americans as a whole</a>, the No. 1 issue for voters over <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/16/publics-top-priority-for-2022-strengthening-the-nations-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65 is the economy</a>, and the GOP’s messaging there might resonate more with older voters concerned with things like inflation, rising prices of everyday items and unemployment if they’re not retired. “I suspect most of it has to do with accumulating more money as they get older, and wanting to protect their monetary interests. They believe the Republican policies will help protect their interests,” said Liz McGeachy, a 64-year-old from Tennessee. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another point might also contribute to why older Americans often lean Republican: They’re <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/23/millennials-are-just-as-racist-as-their-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely</a> to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/08/12/deep-divisions-in-americans-views-of-nations-racial-history-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be racist</a>. In a September 2021 Public Religion Research Institute survey, Americans ages 65 and older were 25 points more likely to say that America’s “culture and way of life” had mostly changed for the worse since the 1950s than they were to say it’d mostly changed for the better — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-keep-losing-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a common refrain</a> among the GOP voters these days. And according to data that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew</a> published in January 2019, older generations were less likely than younger generations to say that they thought more racial and ethnic diversity was a good thing for society. In September 2021, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/27/support-for-black-lives-matter-declined-after-george-floyd-protests-but-has-remained-unchanged-since/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew also found</a> that adults ages 50-64 (49 percent) and those ages 65 and older (46 percent) were the age groups least likely to support the Black Lives Matter movement. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, as the Democratic Party <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/racial-ethnic-diversity-increases-yet-again-with-the-117th-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becomes increasingly multiracial</a>, older white voters — especially those <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with racially conservative views</a> — might be turned off from supporting Democrats. “I don’t know whether it’s racism and the fear that Latino and African American people are going to have more power someday?” Helbing said. “I guess a lot of people see life as a zero-sum game that if you get, I lose.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The older progressive voters I talked with, of course, don’t buy into that messaging and, as a result, have been loyal Democratic voters for most — if not all — of their lives. That said, just because the people I spoke with identify as progressives doesn’t mean they were necessarily over the moon with the current Democrats holding federal office. Many gave Biden plaudits for handling what one voter called a “disaster” inherited by the Trump administration, but they also weren’t optimistic that more progressive policies would happen anytime soon.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“Sometimes there’s this expectation that everything is going to change now, but I think change is a moderate experience and not necessarily immediate,” said Pamela M., the 52-year-old from Maryland. “I have progressive ideas on what should happen but a realistic timeline on when it’ll happen. A lot of young progressives think you can vote and win an election and everything changes, but that’s not how things typically work.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this pragmatism could be because, as Ellinger told me, voters his age have been following politics for so long that they know it takes a long time for real change to occur. That’s especially true today, given the fact that a moderate Democrat holds the presidency and Democrats hold only slim majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think Biden and such represent a substantial majority of the Democratic Party. It would be great to the extent that could be changed, to add more people to the left of them in positions of power, but I don’t think, at this moment, that’ll happen,” Ellinger said. “Democracy doesn’t always give you perfect results, but the nature of it is working with people who are representative of most of your political beliefs.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there might be another reason why progressive ideas aren’t likely to pass anytime soon: a perception among voters that Democrats are already <em>too </em>liberal. According to data that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/26/state-of-the-parties-ideology-extremes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> published in July 2021, the share of registered voters between 2017 and 2021 who said the Democratic Party was “too liberal” rose 5 percentage points. In 2021, a plurality of all voters (45 percent) and independent voters (46 percent) were more likely to say this was the case, compared with 37 percent of voters and 34 percent of independents who said the GOP has gone too far right.</p>

And while some people either endorsed this idea or admitted that the party now is further right than they are, most said that the best way for the Democratic Party to move forward would be for them to develop a message that can unite everyone in their base and cease infighting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I lean toward wanting the moderate Democrats to embrace the policies of the more progressive members of the party, but I also believe the progressive wing needs to be willing to compromise too,” McGeachy said. “They all need to create a unified message, stand behind it and share it with the whole country — not just preach to the choir.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, many voters think that politicians around the age of, say, Biden, who will turn 80 in November, shouldn’t be the ones running the show — let alone holding the presidency. Many advocated for ushering in younger, nonwhite leaders into the Democratic Party who could help move it further left. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“I think when you hit 70 years old, you say, ‘It’s time to make room for another generation. I will tend my garden or write poetry or stare out a window, but I will make room so that other people can have a crack at it,’” said Helbing, the 70-year-old in Indiana. “Because they couldn’t screw things up any more than we have.” Biden, she said, is going to be in his 80s in mere months. “I’m going to be 71 soon, and I don’t think I’m as sharp as I was 20 years ago.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Asking older politicians to step down might be tough, though. Beyond the fact that senators and representatives aren’t term-limited, many will sit in office as long as voters keep electing them, instead of choosing to retire. Because of these factors, young people are badly underrepresented in Congress: The <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/117th-congress-book-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average age of a U.S. senator is currently 64</a> — roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241494/median-age-of-the-us-population/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 years older</a> than the median U.S. resident. In the House, the average age is 58. And going into the 2020 election, many of the leading presidential contenders — Trump, Biden and Sanders — were all septuagenarians. Biden himself was first elected to the Senate in 1972, meaning that  he has been in Washington for nearly half a century — longer than most have been alive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s not to say that it’s impossible for a younger, more progressive guard to come into Congress and make the sort of difference that the voters I spoke with want. But it’ll be an uphill battle, especially as party leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continue to back <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/in-case-youre-wondering-nancy-pelosi-is-still-supporting-the-only-antiabortion-house-democrat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more moderate Democrats</a> over <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/us-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-backs-congresswoman-shontel-brown-in-11th-congressional-district-primary/95-b6ee3537-3ba7-4b57-9cd7-e5d29f640aba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their progressive challengers</a> this primary season. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plus, as we’ve previously reported, progressive Democrats often need <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger, multiracial coalitions</a> to win elections. But several of the people I spoke with said it’d be harmful to the party not to start building out a younger bench and helping these Democrats get elected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think Democrats fail to plan for generational change, and so we have a lot of newer, young people coming in, but there hasn’t been a plan for a changing of the guard and changing ideas along with that,” Pamela M. said. “Democrats need to be focusing on local and state elections to see who they can … train as the next generation. And they should’ve been doing this all along.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Last Friday, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade</a>, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years. The decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization has sent states scrambling to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/interactive-map-shows-abortion-bans-effect-doctors-face/story?id=85881916" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrict abortion</a> or <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/us-states-banned-limited-protected-abortion-85641444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand access</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve found seven polls conducted since Friday that show whether U.S. adults approve or disapprove of the Dobbs decision, and as you can see in the table below, the takeaway is clear: More Americans disapprove of the ruling than approve of it.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Hints of this disapproval loomed large before Friday, too. <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/06/24/american-opinion-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a poll conducted by YouGov/The Economist</a> from June 18-21, 50 percent of Americans did not want the court to overturn Roe. And when YouGov ran a survey after the release of the Dobbs decision on June 24, it found that the same percentage of Americans disapproved of the court overruling Roe. (Support for overruling Roe didn’t waver much, either: Thirty-two percent were in favor of overturning Roe in the earlier survey, compared with 37 percent in the later survey.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not just that Americans largely disapprove of the Dobbs decision. <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/njf3k7gj5o/abortion_roe_reaction_toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A third YouGov poll</a>, this one fielded June 24-25, gave respondents 11 different choices to describe their reaction to the decision, and Americans reported feeling disgusted (34 percent) at a higher rate than any other emotion. This was closely followed by feeling sad (33 percent), angry (32 percent) and outraged (31 percent). A far smaller share of Americans reported positive emotions about the decision, such as feeling satisfied (19 percent), grateful (18 percent), happy (17 percent) and thrilled (12 percent). Notably, only 20 percent of Americans said they felt surprised by the decision, perhaps due to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the notorious leaked draft opinion</a> from early May as well as the court’s recent track record, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-conservative-supermajority-is-just-beginning-to-flex-its-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has been very conservative</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-courts-approval-rating-dropping-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85385158</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Still, even though many Americans don’t approve of the court overturning Roe, their thoughts about the legality of abortion haven’t changed much since early September, when <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court allowed Texas’s six-week abortion ban</a> to go into effect. As you can see in the chart below, the breakdown of Americans who believe abortion should be always legal, mostly legal, mostly illegal and always illegal has been relatively stable since then.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="868" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAd.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="954" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/zoha.POLLAm.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, a greater share of Americans consistently think abortion should be mostly or always legal (an average of 58 percent across all surveys) than think it should be mostly or always illegal (an average of 39 percent). But it is telling that there hasn’t been more of a change in how Americans are thinking about abortion.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is that many Americans belong to a gray zone of public opinion when it comes to abortion. Between the “mostly legal” and “mostly illegal” groups, a little over half of Americans think there is no absolute answer as to whether abortion should be legal. Lack of a strong opinion may also correlate with lack of knowledge. As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight reported last December</a>, Gallup found in May 2018 that 60 percent of Americans believed abortion should be generally legal throughout the first trimester, but only 28 percent said the same for the second trimester. And yet this stands in contrast with Americans’ general support for Roe, which protected abortion until nearly the end of the second trimester.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While public opinion on abortion has remained fairly steady, public opinion on the Supreme Court has not. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394103/confidence-supreme-court-sinks-historic-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup data</a>, Americans’ confidence in the court has been trending mostly downward since peaking in 1988, but it nosedived in the past year. Last June, Americans’ confidence in the court sat at 36 percent; however, in June 2022 — ahead of the Dobbs decision but after its draft opinion was leaked — it plummeted to 25 percent. This is the lowest confidence level since Gallup began the surveys almost 50 years ago, and it was driven primarily by a dramatic drop in confidence among Democrats and independents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This isn’t the first time that the Supreme Court has suffered a favorability problem. One prominent example is the court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-contested-2020-election-would-be-way-worse-than-bush-v-gore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision in Bush v. Gore</a>, where the Supreme Court overturned an order by the Florida state Supreme Court to recount a subset of ballots. But there’s a clear difference between now and the early 2000s: While many people didn’t like that decision, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/4732/Supreme-Court.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup reports</a> that 59 percent of Americans approved of the court in January 2001.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That might not be the case this time, though, given today’s incredibly polarized political climate. Additionally, there is evidence of a broader lack of faith in the court, which is at least partly driven by distrust in what is ultimately guiding the court’s decisions. Strikingly, according to an <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-national-poll-the-overturning-of-roe-v-wade-june-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College</a> poll conducted June 24-25, 57 percent of Americans said that overturning Roe was “politically motivated and not motivated by the law.” </p>

<h2>Other polling bites</h2>



<ul><li>The Supreme Court’s ruling on abortion isn’t the only issue where it’s out of step with public opinion. Most Americans also disagreed with its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-gun-ruling-means-for-gun-control/">ruling</a> that New York’s gun-control law was unconstitutional, according to a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_063022/">recent survey from Monmouth University</a>. Fifty-six percent said that states should be allowed to limit the ability of people to carry concealed handguns through permits and other protocols.</li><li>Sixty percent of Americans overall had “very positive” views on their national flag, though that number changes dramatically when broken out by race, age and party, per a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/06/29/how-americans-view-flags-and-symbols-poll">YouGov poll published this week</a>. White Americans were nearly twice as likely as Black Americans to view the flag that favorably (70 percent and 37 percent, respectively). It’s a similar story between adults under the age of 30 (41 percent held a “very positive” view) versus adults over 65 (78 percent), as well as between Democrats (49 percent) and Republicans (83 percent).</li><li>As the Jan. 6 hearings continue, 51 percent of likely voters agreed that Trump-supporting Republicans’ challenges to the results of the 2020 election, including during the Capitol insurrection, were “[a]n attempt to claim and hold power and overturn the will of the people,” according to a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/6/28/a-majority-of-voters-believe-the-jan-6-attack-was-an-attempt-to-hold-power-and-overturn-the-will-of-the-people">poll from Data for Progress</a> conducted June 15-21. Among Democrats, a whopping 87 percent agreed with that view. Only 19 percent of Republicans thought so, however. By contrast, 66 percent of Republicans agreed with the idea that Trump-supporting Republicans’ challenges were “[b]ased on legitimate evidence of fraud, illegal voting, and false results.” </li><li>On the whole, Americans are cutting back on travel, per <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/06/30/summer-trips-will-be-one-and-done-2022/">recent polling from Morning Consult</a>. While the share of Americans planning to travel this summer is up compared with last summer, many said they plan to stick to fewer trips overall. The most noticeable drop comes from the study’s highest income bracket, or those in households that make over $100,000 annually: Only 31 percent planned to go on multiple trips this summer, compared with 44 percent who planned to in 2021. Despite the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-gas-holiday-might-be-popular-but-its-unlikely-to-do-much-to-lower-inflation/">hike in gas prices</a>, there’s been almost no change in those opting to drive (61 percent of travelers this summer and 59 percent last summer). </li></ul><h2>Biden approval</h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans are substantial favorites to take over the U.S. House of Representatives following this November’s midterm elections, but the U.S. Senate is much more competitive, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast</a>, which launched today. Democrats are also favored to hang on to the governorships in a trio of swing states in the Rust Belt — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — although they are significant underdogs to win high-profile gubernatorial races in Georgia and Texas against Republican incumbents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The split diagnosis reflects the difference between macro- and micro-level conditions. The national environment is quite poor for Democrats. Of course, this is typical for the president’s party, which has lost seats in the House in <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but two of the past 21 midterm elections</a>. But Democrats are also saddled with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular President Biden</a> and a series of challenges for the country, including inflation levels that haven’t been seen in decades, the lingering effects of the still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democratic-values-are-still-under-attack-even-without-trump-in-the-white-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraying trust in civic institutions</a> — caused, in part, by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/28/us/jan-6-hearing-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats, as a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-in-blue-cities-are-increasingly-outliers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predominantly urban party</a>, also face a longstanding problem in the Senate, where every state has equal representation regardless of its population, resulting in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial built-in bias toward white, rural states</a>. And although Democrats are <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very slightly better off following the redistricting process in the House</a> than they were under the 2020 maps, there are still more Republican-leaning seats than Democratic-leaning ones.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">True, the political environment is dynamic. The Supreme Court’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision last week to overturn Roe v. Wade</a> is too recent to be fully reflected in polls, but there are reasons to think it will help Democrats. Roe, which granted the constitutional right to abortion,<em> </em><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-despite-public-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a popular precedent</a>, and Democratic voters are <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3537982-democrats-more-likely-to-vote-in-midterms-after-abortion-ruling-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely than Republican ones</a> to say the decision will encourage them to vote at the midterms.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in striking down Roe and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s-gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other popular laws</a> like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-gun-ruling-means-for-gun-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restrictions against the concealed carry of firearms</a>, the Supreme Court has in some ways undermined one of the traditional reasons that the president’s party tends to lose seats at the midterms. Typically, voters like some degree of balance: They do not want one party to have unfettered control of all levers of government. But the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, is a reminder of how much power Republicans have even if they don’t control the White House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 can also serve as a reminder to voters about what might happen if the Electoral College certification process takes place in 2024 amid Republican control of both chambers of Congress.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, note that because Congress is seated &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the electoral vote is counted, it’s the 2024 congressional elections that will determine who sits in Congress at that time — not these ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> Democrats have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-moving-on-from-jan-6-even-if-congress-hasnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had trouble getting the public to treat threats to democracy as a high priority</a>, but polls do show that the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/23/what-are-americans-thinking-about-the-january-6-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public is sympathetic to the Democrats’ case</a>, especially after the recent congressional hearings on the events of Jan. 6.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, this is not a typical, low-stakes midterm election. On the contrary, there are strong forces tugging at each side of the rope, some of which are potentially of existential importance.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democrats’ majorities in both chambers of Congress are narrow, the historical precedent toward the president’s party losing seats is strong, and polls so far — such as the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a>, which asks voters which party they would support in an election — suggest that voters slightly prefer Republican control of Congress.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or at least that’s the story in the House, where there are dozens of competitive races and candidates are relatively anonymous. There, big-picture factors tend to prevail. An unusually weak Republican candidate in one district might be counteracted by a strong one in another, for example.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the Senate and gubernatorial races, by contrast, individual factors can matter more. And the GOP has nominated — or is poised to nominate — candidates who might significantly underperform a “generic” Republican based on some combination of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/19/pennsylvania-republicans-dr-oz-senate-bid-523023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inexperience</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/politics/herschel-walker-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal scandals</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-gop-senate-candidate-masters-privatizing-social-security-2022-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having articulated unpopular conservative positions</a>. This is not a new problem for Republicans: underqualified or fringy candidates have <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-victims-dont-get-pregnant-079864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost them seats in the Senate in other recent cycles</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s briefly run through the model’s forecast for House, Senate and gubernatorial races. Then I’ll describe some changes to the model since 2020 — which are modest this year but reflect how congressional races are changing in an increasingly polarized political environment.</p>



<h2><strong>The House</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an 87 percent chance of taking over the House</a>, according to the Deluxe version of our model. That’s far from certain, but Democrats are fighting the odds: Their 13 percent chances are equivalent to tossing a coin and having it come up tails three times in a row.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="848" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png" alt="Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart showing which party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes from our Deluxe model’s 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 13 percent chance of winning the chamber and Republicans have a 87 percent chance." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-711-2.png?w=1424 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="670" height="1064" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png" alt="Ball-swarm (or bee-swarm) chart showing which party wins control of the House in 100 sample outcomes from our Deluxe model’s 40,000 simulations, where Democrats have a 13 percent chance of winning the chamber and Republicans have a 87 percent chance." data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png?w=670 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-house-topline-335-2.png?w=1340 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That’s not to say House control will be a matter of luck, exactly. A change in the political environment could have ripple effects. For instance, sometimes one party wins nearly all the toss-up races, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans did in 2020</a>. However, even if Democrats were to win all 13 races that our model currently designates as “toss-ups” (meaning that no party has more than a 60 percent chance of winning), plus hold on to all the seats in which they’re favored, they would still wind up with only 208 seats, 10 short of the number they need for a majority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Democrats will also have to win some seats where Republican candidates are currently favored, and that requires the national political environment in November to be more favorable for Democrats than our model is currently expecting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, the task isn’t <em>that</em> daunting for Democrats. Our model calculates that Democrats would be favored to keep the House if they win the House popular vote — or lose it by less than 0.7 percentage points — something that Democrats did in both 2018 and 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, Democrats are down by only about 2 points in our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current average of generic-ballot polls</a>. Given the inherent error in polling, and how much time there is between now and November, it isn’t hard to turn a 2-point deficit in the polls into a 1-point win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, in important ways, that 2-point deficit understates the degree of trouble that Democrats are in. One reason is because many of those polls are conducted among registered voters rather than likely voters, and the electorate that turns out in November is likely to be more Republican than the broader universe of all registered voters. Historically, the patterns in midterm elections are that: 1) Republicans turn out more than Democrats, and 2) voters for whichever party doesn’t control the presidency are more enthusiastic and turn out more. In 2018, those factors canceled one another out. Democrats, not controlling the presidency, were the more enthusiastic party, helping to neutralize the Republicans’ historical turnout advantage. This year, though, they both work in the favor of Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thus, the model adjusts those registered-voter polls based on its estimate of what likely-voter polls would show, and when it does that, the Republicans’ generic-ballot lead is really more like 4 points than 2 points. I should note that this adjustment is not rigid in the model. Although the model uses historical turnout patterns as its baseline assumption, it will override that based on polls. In other words, if polls come out showing Democrats holding their own among likely voters — such as because of increased Democratic enthusiasm in the wake of Roe being overturned — the model will adjust to reflect that. Put another way, a very strong turnout would give Democrats a fighting chance of keeping the House.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But also, the generic ballot isn’t the only input that the model considers, and some of the other factors look worse for Democrats than the generic ballot does. Based on the historical tendency for the president’s party to lose seats in the midterms and Biden’s poor approval rating, for instance, the situation is more likely to get worse for Democrats than better. The model also evaluates factors such as polling and fundraising data in individual races.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, the Deluxe forecast expects Democrats to eventually lose the popular vote for the House by closer to 6 points, about the margin that they lost it by in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a>. And it expects Republicans to wind up with 237 seats in an average outcome, a gain of 24 seats from the 213 they had at the start of the current Congress.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wouldn’t be a catastrophically bad result for Democrats by historical standards — Republicans gained 63 seats in 2010, and Democrats gained 41 in 2018. But that partly reflects that there are so few competitive House seats in a highly polarized country, especially after the redistricting process. Moreover, Republicans already won a number of competitive House seats in 2020, so there isn’t as much low-hanging fruit for them as in previous midterm years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

The Classic version of our model, which leaves out the expert ratings — sacrificing the additional accuracy they add but sticking to purely quantitative factors — tells a similar story, with Democrats also having a 12 percent chance of keeping the House. The Lite version of our model, meanwhile, which tries to forecast as much as it can based on polls alone, does paint a more optimistic picture for Democrats, giving them a 22 percent chance of keeping the House. But that version leaves out a lot of useful information, especially given that there isn’t much polling in a number of competitive House races.</p>



<h2><strong>The Senate</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic hopes of keeping the Senate are much more viable, however. Part of this, as I mentioned, is because they appear to have stronger candidates in a handful of key races. Pennsylvania, for instance — which is an open seat after the retirement of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey — is ordinarily the sort of seat that you’d expect Republicans to win since Pennsylvania is a purple state in a Republican year. However, the Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, is ahead of Republican Mehmet Oz, the doctor and TV personality, in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every poll conducted so far</a>. The model, though, is trained to be a bit skeptical given the fundamentals of the race, so it hedges against those polls and, at this point, has determined that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania is best thought of as a toss-up</a>. Still, that means Democrats have roughly a 50-50 chance of <em>gaining</em> a GOP-held Senate seat, offsetting potential losses elsewhere.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, our forecast sees the overall Senate landscape to be about as competitive as it gets. The Deluxe forecast literally has Senate control as a 50-50 tossup. The Classic and Lite forecasts show Democrats as very slight favorites to keep the Senate, meanwhile, with a 59 and a 62 percent chance, respectively.</p>

Raphael Warnock’s seat in Georgia that were won in off-year special elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> a mediocre year for Democrats in which they lost the popular vote for the House and also lost Senate races in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. Of the 35 Senate seats up for grabs in November, 21 are currently held by Republicans. True, most of these are not competitive, but in addition to their chances to gain a GOP-held seat in Pennsylvania, Democrats also have credible chances in Wisconsin and North Carolina (and outside chances in Ohio and Florida, although those are a stretch given how GOP-leaning both states have become).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans don’t have any surefire pickups, meanwhile. Our model regards their best chances as being in Georgia, but that race is rated as a toss-up. And the races in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a> merely lean toward the Democratic incumbent, meaning they are still highly plausible GOP pickup opportunities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, the picture isn’t as bad as you might expect for Democrats. If the political environment really deteriorates for them, they’ll be in trouble, lose most of the competitive races and even blue states like Colorado could come into play. But if things are merely<em> pretty bad</em> for Democrats instead of catastrophic, the outcome of the Senate will remain uncertain enough that stronger candidates could make the difference for them.</p>



<h2><strong>The Governors’ Mansions</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to talk about gubernatorial races on a systematic basis since there’s no particular prize for winning a majority of governorships. But, for the record, our model does run these calculations, and the Deluxe version estimates that there’s an 83 percent chance that Republicans end up with a majority of governorships following this November’s elections, compared with a 7 percent chance for Democrats. (There is an 10 percent chance that neither party has a majority.) However, a lot of these governorships are in smaller, lower-population states, and the model thinks there’s a 73 percent chance that the majority of the U.S. population will reside in states run by Democratic governors.</p>

Indeed, partisanship matters less in gubernatorial races than in races for Congress, even if it matters more than it once did. Consider, for instance, that there are currently Democratic governors in Kansas and Louisiana and Republican ones in Massachusetts and Maryland, although several of those seats could flip parties this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, incumbency is a powerful force in gubernatorial races. For instance, even though Michigan is a slightly red-leaning state, its incumbent Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a clear favorite against a Republican field marred by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/05/1103144991/5-republicans-are-off-the-michigan-gubernatorial-ballot-after-signature-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraudulent attempts to access the ballot</a> and the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-raids-home-of-michigan-republican-gubernatorial-candidate-ryan-kelley?ref=scroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrest of a leading candidate</a> for his participation in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Meanwhile, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers, also a Democratic incumbent, is a favorite against a Republican field where the most likely nominee is Rebecca Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor. This is the sort of race where abortion could matter: Technically, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/overturning-roe-sets-stage-wisconsins-1849-ban-take-effect/7703590001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin’s 173-year-old abortion ban</a> — which outlaws all abortions, except in cases to save the life of the mother — is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now in effect</a> following the Dobbs decision, although the Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has said he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-wisconsin-431bdc117a5ca8a9608d1ba8250f6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t enforce the ban</a>.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Evers have also mounted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1541849090987884544" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a legal challenge&lt;/a&gt; to strike down the ban, and Evers has &lt;a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/evers-tells-convention-rally-hell-grant-clemency-to-docs-convicted-under-wisconsin-abortion-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;promised to pardon&lt;/a&gt; any doctors convicted of performing an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> But Kleefisch has <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/views-on-abortion-to-shake-up-campaigns-upcoming-elections-in-wisconsin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said she opposes abortion</a> even in cases of rape and incest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Republicans also have some strongly positioned incumbents. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an 86 percent favorite</a> to hold on against Democrat Stacey Abrams, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 95 percent favorite</a> against Democrat Beto O’Rourke. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a co-favorite with former President Donald Trump</a> to be the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, is also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 94 percent favorite</a> to win a second term.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps the most important gubernatorial race is in Pennsylvania, an open-seat race as the Democratic incumbent governor, Tom Wolf, is term-limited. There, the Republican nominee, Doug Mastriano, was present outside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/inq2/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-2020-election-denial-timeline-20220609.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked to overturn Biden’s win in Pennsylvania</a>, potentially yielding a constitutional crisis if he’s governor in Pennsylvania and the election outcome is close again there in 2024. But <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/governor/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastriano is an underdog</a> against Democrat Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania attorney general.</p>

<h2><strong>Changes to the model</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, we’re happy with our congressional and gubernatorial forecasts, which last underwent a major revision before the 2018 elections. They performed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2018-midterm-forecasts-did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very well in 2018</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-forecasts-did-and-what-well-be-thinking-about-for-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fairly well in 2020</a> (despite a challenging year for the polls in 2020; it helped that our model also considers a number of other factors in addition to the polling). Therefore, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-fivethirtyeights-house-and-senate-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall methodology is largely the same</a>. However, after assessing the performance of the models, we did make a few changes around the margins:</p>



<ol><li><strong>In evaluating fundraising for congressional candidates, the model now places more emphasis on contributions received within the candidate’s state.</strong> Fundraising is a highly nationalized activity these days; Democrats in California and New York regularly contribute to Senate campaigns like that of Democrat Jaime Harrison of South Carolina, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/11/politics/jaime-harrison-fundraising-record-south-carolina-senate-race/index.html">raised a record amount of money in 2020</a><strong> </strong>but nonetheless lost to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham by 10 percentage points. As such, our analysis finds that a dollar received from within a candidate’s state is about five times as valuable as a dollar received outside of it in predicting the eventual election outcome.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the value of fundraising as a predictive variable is not just because the money can be used to buy advertising and other services, but it’s also as an indicator of organic, grassroots support.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Harrison used money from California or New York to buy ads and hire staff, but that didn’t mean there was a groundswell of voters in South Carolina looking to support him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> That’s why the model now applies that ratio, multiplying any funds raised from voters within the candidate’s state by 5, when assessing which candidate has the fundraising edge.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>The model now puts more emphasis on basic partisanship as opposed to other fundamentals. </strong>The fundamentals component of our model, used in the Classic and Deluxe versions, evaluates a series of variables such as fundraising, incumbency, candidate experience, congressional voting records and even scandals to make a forecast. The formula is fairly complicated, so we tested a simple alternative in an era of high partisanship. Specifically, we looked at what would happen if you made a forecast based solely on the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/">partisan lean of a state or district</a>, plus generic-ballot results. For instance, if the generic ballot favors Republicans by 4 percentage points, and a state leans Republican by 3 points, you might expect the Republican to win there by 7 points. In testing this on 2018 and 2020 races, we found that the more complicated version of our fundamentals formula does outperform this simple alternative. But it’s pretty close, and a blend of the complicated and simple formulas does better than either one taken alone.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, in the new version of our model, the simple formula gets 35 percent of the weight in congressional races and 17.5 percent for gubernatorial races, while the complicated one gets 65 percent and 82.5 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> What this means is that state partisanship and the generic ballot will have more influence on our model going forward and the other fundamentals factors less, although they certainly matter some.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>We assume errors are more correlated from race to race</strong>. In presidential races, forecast and polling errors are highly correlated from state to state. It wasn’t a surprise that Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 2016 given that he also won Michigan, for example, since the states are fairly similar demographically. (Accounting for this properly was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/">big reason that FiveThirtyEight’s model gave Trump a better chance than others</a> in 2016.) This also holds in congressional races, though to a considerably lesser degree since there are different candidates on the ballot in each state. A scandal affecting the Republican candidate in Georgia won’t necessarily have any impact in Arizona, for instance. However, our analysis suggests that polling errors are becoming more correlated in congressional races, too. Certainly, 2020 was a prominent example given that Republicans won nearly every toss-up race for the House and that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/">polls for Congress had a strong overall bias toward Democrats</a>. Therefore, we’ve increased the degree to which race-by-race errors are assumed to be correlated in the model.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as increasing the overall amount of error in the forecast. Our technique for calculating forecast error is somewhat complicated, but to simplify, there’s a national component and a local component, where the local component applies only to one race and the national component applies to all races across the board. In this year’s version of the model, we’ve increased the national error but &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; the local error, meaning that the overall forecast error is about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><strong>We’ve reduced the emphasis on sample size when weighting polls. </strong>This is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/">consistent with a change in our pollster ratings methodology</a> and is explained in more detail there.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li><strong>We’ve removed </strong><strong>a </strong><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/"><strong>series of changes</strong></a><strong> in the 2020 model that were specific to the COVID-19</strong><strong> pandemic. </strong>Yes, I know the pandemic isn’t over yet, but voting will take place under far more normal conditions than in 2020.</li></ol><p data-paragraph="main">Finally, a couple pieces of housekeeping. A number of states haven’t held their primaries yet, so in those cases, we guess at the most likely nominees based on polling, fundraising and other factors. These “presumed nominees” are designated with an asterisk in the interactive. If you see anything egregiously wrong — such as a candidate listed as a presumptive nominee when they’ve dropped out of the race — <a href="mailto:polls@fivethirtyeight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">please drop us a line</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re also still thinking about how best to handle Alaska, which has a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Top-four_primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new system in place this year</a> in which the top-four finishers in the primary advance to the general election regardless of political party, and then the general election outcome is determined by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-alaskas-special-election-create-an-opening-for-sarah-palins-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting</a> (or, as some call it, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/might-this-be-good-time-for-instant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an instant runoff</a>) if no candidate receives a majority. This is not entirely dissimilar to the way elections are conducted in Louisiana, in which all candidates from all parties appear on the ballot in a blanket nonpartisan primary in November, and then there’s a runoff later between the top-two candidates if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote. In fact, we’re currently taking a bit of a shortcut by using the Louisiana code for Alaska, essentially treating the instant runoff as though it’s an actual runoff where voters go to the polls again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We may revisit this assumption later, but it does avoid one potential pitfall. In Alaska’s House, Senate and gubernatorial races, it’s fairly likely that we’ll end up with one Democratic candidate but two or three Republican candidates following the Aug. 16 primaries. If the Republican vote is divided two or three ways, it may well be that the Democrat initially receives the plurality of the vote. However, this lead is unlikely to survive the instant-runoff process assuming voters for one Republican rank the other Republicans ahead of any Democrat. The process we use for Louisiana assumes that votes mostly tend to stay within the same party in the event of a runoff, and this same assumption is in place in Alaska. Thus, we have Republicans as fairly heavy favorites in the Alaska races, although the new system introduces some uncertainty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The forecast itself will update continuously whenever new polls or other information are added to our database. We’ll also publish a written update to the forecast once per week or so, usually on Fridays, to review new data and other changes in the landscape, before upping the frequency as the election draws closer. We hope you’ll regularly visit FiveThirtyEight as part of your midterms rotation.</p>]]></description>

Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm forecast! We’ve got a bit of a split diagnosis in this election: Republicans are favored to win the House, while the Senate is a toss-up. How can this be? Well, as editor-in-chief Nate Silver writes in his overview of the forecast, the national environment doesn’t look good for Democrats, which is why we expect Republicans to make gains in the House — even though those gains might not be historic. But in the Senate, candidate quality matters a lot more, and this could prove to be a silver lining for Democrats. It’s a similar story in the 36 races for governor.<br>
Remember, though, we’re still a little more than four months away from Election Day, so there’s still plenty of time for things to change. To read more about how our forecasts work, please check out our methodology.<br>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Friday, the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned Roe v. Wade</a>, leaving it up to individual states to decide whether abortion is legal within their borders. As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, nine states have already banned or restricted the procedure, and by the end of July, at least another six will have joined them. But the post-Roe landscape could change even more dramatically after the 2022 midterm elections — especially in states where control of state government is on the line and where the future of abortion policy is up in the air. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve identified seven states where the results of the midterms could decide whether abortion is protected or banned. Here are the relevant races in those states as well as how abortion policy could change following each possible electoral outcome.</p>



<h2><strong>Kansas</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The first state where abortion will be on the ballot in 2022 is Kansas. Its state Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.kcur.org/2019-04-26/kansas-supreme-court-rules-state-constitution-protects-right-to-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously ruled</a> that the state constitution implicitly protects abortion rights, but that could change when Kansans head to the ballot box on Aug. 2 to vote on a <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article261074192.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state constitutional amendment</a> that says that the Kansas Constitution does <em>not</em> protect abortion rights and explicitly gives the Republican-controlled state legislature the authority to legislate on the issue. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is something Republicans in the state have <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article262858623.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long pushed for</a>, and this specific measure was on the ballot <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article262850433.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well in advance</a> of the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. We haven’t seen any public polls on the referendum, but if it passes, Kansas’s gubernatorial election could determine the future of abortion rights in the state. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is up for reelection and, given Kansas’s deep-red hue, faces a challenging race against likely Republican candidate Attorney General Derek Schmidt. If Schmidt defeats Kelly, Republicans will have no remaining obstacles to banning or restricting abortion in the state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even if Kelly doesn’t lose, however, Republicans could still ban or restrict abortion as long as they retain their veto-proof supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. Right now, Republicans have 28 of the 40 seats<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article262242287.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;conservative independent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> in the Kansas state Senate (a supermajority is 27) and 86 of the 125 seats in the state House of Representatives (a supermajority is 84).</p>



<h2><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Control of the governorship could also determine the future of abortion rights in Pennsylvania. Abortion is currently legal in Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until the 24th week of pregnancy</a> (after which there are very few exemptions), and it’s likely to stay that way at least through the midterms. However, abortion <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/what-if-roe-fell/?state=PA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t legally protected</a> in the state, and over the years, Republican lawmakers have passed numerous restrictions chipping away access, including counseling requirements and a 24-hour waiting period.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pa-gov-wolf-vetoes-controversial-abortion-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has vetoed</a> multiple laws that would have made it harder to get an abortion, including a <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/11/gov-tom-wolf-vetoes-bill-outlawing-abortions-over-down-syndrome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 bill</a> that would have banned abortion after a Down syndrome diagnosis. But Wolf is term-limited, and if Republican gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, a state senator, becomes Pennsylvania’s next governor, he has indicated he would <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/abortion-pennsylvania-candidates-2022-midterm-governor-mastriano-fetterman-shapiro-oz-20220624.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support a total ban on abortion</a>, with no exceptions for the life of the mother. However, <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2022-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election handicappers</a> believe that the race leans toward Democratic candidate Josh Shapiro, the state’s attorney general, who has vowed to veto any bill restricting abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if Shapiro wins the governorship, it’s unlikely that Democrats would be able to enshrine abortion protections into state law. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-redistricting-affects-the-battle-for-state-legislatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thanks to redistricting</a>, the state House is competitive this year, but the state Senate is likely <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of reach for Democrats</a>. Therefore, the only party with a realistic shot at taking full control of Pennsylvania state government — and passing its preferred abortion policy — is the Republican Party.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP21116751687565-711.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP21116751687565-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP21116751687565-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP21116751687565-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>In Arizona, a 15-week abortion ban will take effect in September, and this year’s gubernatorial race will decide whether access to the procedure is limited even further.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Arizona</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Starting in September, abortion in Arizona will be <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/30/gov-ducey-signs-bill-outlawing-abortions-after-15-weeks-arizona/7223681001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricted to 15 weeks</a>, except in the event of life-threatening medical emergencies. But it’s possible that Arizona’s legal framework could become even <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2022/06/24/arizona-abortion-law-roe-v-wade-repeal/7648545001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more restrictive</a> in the post-Dobbs world. When passing the 15-week ban on abortion into law, GOP legislators decided not to repeal a <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/1901-arizona-comstock-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1901 law</a> that criminalizes abortion, <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5125157/arizona-state-sen-nancy-barto-provides-updates-to-state-abortion-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the possibility</a> that the older, more restrictive rule could come into effect. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich have said Arizona will follow the recently established 15-week ban, which means that any further changes to the state’s legal code will likely depend on which party controls the state government after the 2022 election (although court decisions <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/06/24/arizona-republicans-cheer-supreme-court-ruling-on-abortion-democrats-express-outrage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could also determine</a> which law has primacy).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the election front, Ducey is term-limited, so Arizona’s next governor will be decided in what is shaping up to be a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toss-up contest</a> between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and the winner of the GOP primary, likely either former newscaster Kari Lake or state Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson. Both Republicans could back stricter abortion laws, too. <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/06/24/arizona-reacts-supreme-court-roe-v-wade-abortion-ruling/7641911001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Following the Dobbs decision</a>, Lake said that as governor she would “sign bills to protect life when they land on my desk,” while Robson said she’d work to continue Arizona’s “tradition as one of the strongest pro-Life states in the nation.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The gubernatorial race will ultimately be key, too, in determining whether Arizona’s state government is divided or under one party’s control. That’s because while Republicans hold very narrow majorities in both the state Senate and House, the new legislative map is marginally more GOP-leaning than the current one, meaning there’s a good chance Republicans retain their edge.</p>



<h2><strong>Wisconsin</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since the Dobbs decision, Wisconsin clinics have been proceeding as if <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/overturning-roe-sets-stage-wisconsins-1849-ban-take-effect/7703590001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion is now illegal</a> in the state based on an 1849 law banning the procedure, except to save the life of the mother. However, state Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, has said he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-wisconsin-431bdc117a5ca8a9608d1ba8250f6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t enforce the ban</a>, and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/evers-tells-convention-rally-hell-grant-clemency-to-docs-convicted-under-wisconsin-abortion-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised to pardon</a> any doctors convicted of performing an abortion. In fact, on Tuesday, Evers and Kaul <a href="https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1541849090987884544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a legal challenge</a> to the 1849 ban. (Evers has also said he is considering executive action that would limit local prosecutors’ ability to enforce the law.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Kaul and Evers could both lose reelection in 2022. Evers’s loss would be especially consequential: Not only might doctors once again face jail time for performing abortions if the 1849 ban is determined to be operative, but also, if it is not, a Republican governor could join forces with the Republican-led legislature to pass a modern abortion ban. The opposite situation — Democrats winning the legislature and working with Evers to enact new abortion <em>protections</em> — is pretty much off the table, though. Wisconsin’s state-legislative maps are <a href="https://statedemocracy.law.wisc.edu/featured/2022/explainer-wisconsins-new-state-legislative-maps-compare-unfavorably-to-other-court-adopted-maps-on-partisan-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily biased toward the GOP</a>, so Democrats do not have a realistic shot at winning either chamber.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/political-consequences-overturning-roe-wade-85819633</p>


<h2><strong>North Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion is <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/what-overturning-roe-v-wade-would-mean-people-carolinas/FHMKX46CNRBDLD7ISE3DYUO2XE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still legal in North Carolina</a>, though the Supreme Court’s decision could pave the way for the courts to reinstate the state’s <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article262858658.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-week abortion ban</a>, which was ruled unconstitutional in 2019. But state Senate President Phil Berger and state House Speaker Tim Moore — both Republicans — have said they will not pass any new abortion-related laws this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because the governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, is a Democrat and can veto anything the Republican legislature passes. And unfortunately for Republicans, Cooper isn’t on the ballot in 2022 — his term doesn’t end until January 2025. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Republicans are hoping to win three-fifths majorities in this year’s state-legislative elections, which would allow them to override Cooper’s vetoes. They’ve also explicitly said they hope to use such supermajorities to <a href="https://www.wral.com/how-long-will-abortion-remain-legal-in-nc-state-republicans-weigh-next-steps/20346274/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass “pro-life protections”</a> starting in January. And they may very well get the votes they need. Republicans currently have 28 out of 50 seats in the Senate (two shy of a veto-proof majority) and 69 out of 120 in the House (three shy of a veto-proof majority). Moreover, a <a href="https://www.johnlocke.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/19701-JLF-NC-Toplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Cygnal poll</a> found that 51 percent of North Carolina likely voters would vote for a Republican legislative candidate, while only 39 percent would vote for a Democratic one. If that comes to pass, it probably would indeed result in Republicans winning enough seats to unilaterally pass new anti-abortion legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Republicans do win veto-proof majorities and pass new restrictions, one last 2022 campaign could loom large: the race for two seats on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Democrats currently have a 4-3 majority on the court, and if they hold onto that, they could strike down either the 20-week ban or future abortion restrictions passed by the legislature on the grounds that they violate the state constitution. But if Republicans flip at least one of those seats, the court would be much more likely to uphold them.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In Michigan, the future of abortion is complicated because it doesn’t just hinge on what happens in the midterms. First, the courts may decide the future of abortion in the state. There is currently a <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/roe-v-wade-overturned-blockbuster-ruling-abortion-still-legal-michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1931 state law</a> on the books that bans abortion, except when the mother’s life is in danger. That law, though, is not currently in effect because of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/27/1107727009/in-michigan-abortion-could-come-down-to-voters-in-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preliminary injunction issued</a> by a Michigan Court of Claims judge in response to a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood against the old statute. But Michigan’s Supreme Court could soon issue an opinion on the constitutionality of abortion, either through that case or one brought by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. In April, the governor <a href="https://statenews.com/article/2022/04/whitmer-challenges-1931-abortion-ban-at-michigan-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked the state’s high court</a> to issue a ruling on whether the 1931 law is legal under the state constitution, and after Dobbs, Whitmer <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/whitmer-appeals-michigan-supreme-court-take-up-abortion-ban-challenge/7725173001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated her call for a ruling</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if the courts don’t issue a ruling soon, it’s possible voters will decide first via a ballot initiative. Abortion-rights supporters <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-michigan-ballot-initiative/7722914001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been campaigning</a> for a proposed ballot measure to codify the right to an abortion in Michigan’s constitution. And if the measure qualifies for the November ballot — we won’t know until July — polls suggest it could pass. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In May, a <a href="https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/May-2022-Michigan-Voter-Survey-Report_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glengariff Group/Detroit Regional Chamber poll</a> found 59 percent of registered voters supported a constitutional amendment making abortion legal in Michigan, compared with 28 percent who opposed it. Similarly, an <a href="https://progressmichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/LE-Newsletter-Issue25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early June survey</a> by Public Policy Polling on behalf of Progress Michigan found 54 percent supported overturning the 1931 law to keep abortion legal in Michigan, while 30 percent opposed doing so. However, a potential referendum could still end up being competitive. Votes on ballot measures <a href="https://catalist.us/catalist-data-scientists-discuss-new-research-at-aapor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sometimes unexpectedly close</a> in cases where public opinion surveys suggest that views are lopsidedly in favor of one position.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if that referendum does not make the ballot — or fails — and the courts still haven’t weighed in, any future abortion legislation will rest on which party controls the governor’s mansion and the state legislature. The most likely outcome is that the government is divided, with Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-the-gop-could-make-or-break-its-chances-in-10-key-governors-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controlling the governorship</a> and Republicans <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding onto the state Senate and House</a>, but the possibility that Republicans — or Democrats — sweep can’t be ruled out. And, of course, if Republicans wind up in control of Michigan at all levels of government, abortion rights would likely be curtailed because <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/abortion-opinion-upends-michigan-campaigns-see-where-candidates-stand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every notable Republican gubernatorial contender is against them</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22176008306608-711.jpg" alt="Georgia reproductive rights advocates demonstrate in front of the state capitol" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22176008306608-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22176008306608-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22176008306608-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Though Republicans are favored to hold the governorship in Georgia this year, a win by Democrat Stacey Abrams would likely end any attempt from them to pass abortion restrictions stronger than a six-week ban that will likely soon take effect. <p>Ben Gray / AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Georgia</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unlike many of its Southern neighbors, Georgia didn’t have a law in place that automatically banned abortion if Roe were overturned. The state also also didn’t have an unenforced abortion ban on the books. It does, however, have a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/us/georgia-six-week-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s been tied up in the courts</a> since it was passed in 2019. That law could go into effect as soon as the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals frees it from legal purgatory — which could happen very soon.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into the midterm election, the question now is whether Democrat Stacey Abrams can defeat Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in their rematch, since Republicans are very likely to retain solid majorities in the state Senate and House. Polls show that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abrams is an underdog</a>, but in theory, an Abrams victory would put a veto in place to halt any GOP attempt to create an even stricter law. That said, it’s not clear that, if Kemp were to win, an all-out prohibition on abortion would be likely. Back in 2019, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-georgia-moves-to-activate-six-week-abortion-ban-democrats-vow-to-stop-it/ATDU7TCSYBCFZBPSIO7NSTYUTI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there wasn’t sufficient support</a> in the legislature for even more aggressive legislation, and Kemp has said <a href="https://twitter.com/GovKemp/status/1540406289301389314" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his goal is to fully implement</a> the measures contained within the six-week ban.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">These seven states are where the midterm elections could most impact the future of abortion rights. However, they are not the <em>only</em> states where shifts in the electoral mood could affect abortion access. Most notably, Democrats have full control of government in Maine, but a GOP sweep is not out of the question there, possibly presenting conservatives with an opportunity to roll back the state’s law <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2022/06/24/politics/maines-abortion-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permitting abortions until around 24 weeks</a>. On the flip side, even if Republicans sweep into power in Nevada, abortion access would likely not change there because a 1990 referendum <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/what-does-u-s-supreme-courts-roe-v-wade-reversal-mean-for-nevada-2591236/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established the right to an abortion</a> within 24 weeks, and it would take another referendum to undo this. But more generally, remember that the fight over abortion access will extend well beyond the 2022 election.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">We already took a look at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-democratic-primaries-to-watch-in-illinois-and-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the nine Democratic primaries to watch</a> in a preview yesterday, so now we’re back with the 21 GOP contests to watch tonight, plus a bonus special election. As with most Republican primaries this cycle, almost all the GOP contenders are favorably inclined toward former President Donald Trump, but they vary in just how much they support Trump or his false claims about fraud in the 2020 election. But importantly, Democrats are also meddling in many GOP primaries by spending money to boost the most extreme Republican candidates, aiming to make it easier for Democrats to win in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Without further ado, let’s tour the high-profile races in Colorado, Illinois, Mississippi, New York, Oklahoma and Utah, along with a special election in Nebraska. We’ll go through the races based on when the polls close, starting with Illinois, which coincidentally also has the most high-profile GOP contests.</p>

Darren Bailey has emerged as the front-runner in the GOP gubernatorial primary in Illinois. <p>Michael B. Thomas / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Illinois</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 6th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th congressional districts; governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Land of Lincoln hosts seven notable GOP primaries today, and the party’s contest for <strong>governor</strong> has attracted easily the most interest and money. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire <a href="https://data.centerforilpolitics.org/committee/jb-for-governor-32762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who’s given his reelection campaign</a> an eye-popping $125 million, is the likely general election favorite considering how blue Illinois is, but Pritzker is far from the only wealthy person involved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Republican primary to take on Pritzker is also raft with money: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadels-griffin-rises-as-top-gop-donor-urges-business-leaders-to-join-him-11650013200?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hedge fund founder</a> Ken Griffin, for instance, has contributed $50 million of the $53 million <a href="https://data.centerforilpolitics.org/committee/irvin-for-illinois-37129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised by Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin</a>, who would be Illinois’s first Black governor if elected. And <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/70fbafde-a802-4425-ab9c-735788f575f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP megadonor</a> Richard Uihlein <a href="https://data.centerforilpolitics.org/committee/bailey-for-illinois-34092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has donated $9 million</a> of the roughly $11 million that state Sen. Darren Bailey has brought in. (Uihlein has also contributed $8 million to a <a href="https://data.centerforilpolitics.org/committee/people-who-play-by-the-rules-pac-37277" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-Bailey PAC</a>.) Venture capitalist Jesse Sullivan <a href="https://www.wcia.com/illinois-capitol-news/gop-newcomer-with-billionaire-backing-calls-to-moderate-these-crazy-extremes-in-bid-for-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also garnered his own wealthy backers</a>, as $11 million of the $12.6 million he’s raised comes from just three donors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Until a few weeks ago, Irvin seemed like the favorite, too. He’d raised the most money, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KyTFr3RyWT15fkgy7F-1wb8Q1vnPVXUg/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two surveys</a> released <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/573674828/GOP-race-for-Illinois-governor-Emerson-Poll-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early May</a> also gave him an edge over Bailey, and Irvin seemed to be making a compelling case to voters that he was a <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2022/01/26/richard-irvin-launches-gubernatorial-campaign-questionable-claims-about-protests-unrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tough-on-crime leader</a> who would <a href="https://youtu.be/5gC1dZQSqNw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean up state politics</a>. But Bailey and his allies have since turned the tables by <a href="https://youtu.be/BDkomxVgzm0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portraying Irvin</a> as <a href="https://youtu.be/_mmKrXWw25I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a closet liberal</a>, while Pritzker and the Democratic Governors Association <a href="https://www.illinoistimes.com/springfield/republican-party-losing-middle-ground/Content?oid=15285577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have spent millions</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/wYauzOuu9Sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damage Irvin</a> and <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/79d1c9fd-300b-406d-ae2a-4a165235aa7e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost the more conservative Bailey</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Polls now show Bailey ahead of Irvin. Democratic pollster Public Policy Polling has been surveying the race for the Chicago Sun-Times and WBEZ, and both its <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2022/6/10/23161925/sun-times-wbez-poll-republican-downstate-farmer-bailey-double-digit-lead-aurora-mayor-irvin-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early</a> and <a href="https://indiananewsjournal.com/new-poll-shows-bailey-ahead-in-gop-primary-irvin-reassessing-strategy-courts-police-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late June polls</a> put Bailey at 32 percent and Irvin in the mid-to-high teens. Meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/tahmanbradley/status/1536687262494228481?s=20&amp;t=lV-EnMoqezblX9BCfaHBFA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two surveys</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/tahmanbradley/status/1540827557532139522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ogden &amp; Fry</a> and one poll from <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/il-gov-gop-0614/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Trafalgar Group,</a> both GOP-aligned pollsters, also found Bailey north of 30 percent and Irvin trailing by double digits (one even had Sullivan ahead of Irvin for second). And on Saturday, Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/25/trump-endorses-bailey-in-illinois-republican-primary-00042419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed Bailey</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In more bad news for Irvin: He <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-column-richard-irvin-republican-governors-primary-washington-20220620-hacscoszdnb7ff46arturmjwh4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled back on advertising</a> in Republican-rich southern Illinois and was outspent <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/illinois-playbook/2022/06/23/abortion-takes-over-the-campaign-trail-00041650" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by his opponents</a> in the final days of the campaign. Moreover, Irvin’s main benefactor has abandoned the state: Griffin announced last week that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ken-griffin-moving-citadel-from-chicago-to-miami-following-crime-complaints-11655994600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he is moving his hedge fund</a> from Chicago to Miami.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the gubernatorial clash, the state’s highest-profile GOP primary is the race between Republican Reps. Rodney Davis and Mary Miller in the new <strong>15th District</strong>, one of the nation’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-6-house-races-where-incumbents-are-likely-to-face-another-incumbent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six incumbent-versus-incumbent primaries</a>. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois Democrats drew</a> an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/illinois-may-be-the-worst-democratic-gerrymander-in-the-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggressive gerrymander</a> that made Davis’s old district Democratic-leaning and placed half of Miller’s old 15th District in the same seat as the longer-tenured GOP Rep. Mike Bost, so both incumbents opted instead to run in this south-central Illinois district, even though Miller and Davis represent just 31 percent and 28 percent of its constituents, respectively.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This race, though, features clear ideological differences that might give Miller the upper hand in a seat that is 42 points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> Not only does Miller <a href="https://voteview.com/person/22138/mary-e-miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a more conservative voting record</a>, she has the Trumpier resume, having voted against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certifying the 2020 presidential results</a> and the creation of a bipartisan commission to <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigate the Jan. 6 attack</a> on the U.S. Capitol. She also has the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/01/politics/donald-trump-mary-miller-2022/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement of Trump</a>, who even <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-rep-miller-speaking-alongside-trump-calls-scotus/story?id=85726659" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned with her</a> at a recent rally where she told the audience that the Supreme Court decision <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/elections/ct-mary-miller-white-life-20220626-dblqfcjemrhcvdxzbyv43lw7xm-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturning Roe v. Wade</a> was a “historic victory for white life.” (A campaign aide has said she misspoke and meant to say “right to life,” but Miller is no stranger to controversy, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/illinois-congresswoman-says-hitler-was-right-on-one-thing/2409325/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having previously praised Hitler in a speech</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, Davis <a href="https://voteview.com/person/21328/rodney-davis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has one of the most moderate voting records</a> of any House Republican. He also voted both to certify the 2020 outcome and create a bipartisan Jan. 6 commission. Consequently, Miller and her allies have tagged Davis <a href="https://youtu.be/35nXapy2ma4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a “RINO”</a> — a Republican in name only — while <a href="https://youtu.be/xDhTZKqf3tA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting him for backing</a> the commission and <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/fe90c0d2-a9c1-4a0a-a63b-cbd636ca3499" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminding voters that Trump supports Miller</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Davis has more money than Miller, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL13120/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $3.5 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0IL15129/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to her</a> $1.5 million as of June 8. Davis has also attacked Miller’s conservative bona fides <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/19dad9d7-420b-4800-9204-da1f6bcc1f3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by claiming that she</a> “voted with the Squad” on a military spending bill, referring to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-squad-tells-us-about-progressives-ability-to-win-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive members of Congress</a> who are mostly women of color. <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/2dde4cec-d3bc-448c-8632-d9ca3aa34a02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He’s also accused Miller</a> of being soft on immigration and for having used a campaign driver <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/politics/miller-campaign-volunteer-convicted-luring-young-boy-for-sex/63-e90e0853-6329-4749-a45a-78d053326ce8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who pleaded guilty</a> in 2005 to luring a young boy for sex.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The race’s final two polls suggest it could go either way, although both come from potentially biased sources. Miller’s campaign released a survey in mid-June from Cygnal <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ed0jfwA0fU7aJTFfY_tH-1-7fr9wJKgY/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that found her ahead</a> 45 percent to 40 percent, while Davis led 38 percent to 35 percent in a  recent <a href="https://theillinoize.substack.com/p/the-illinoize-exclusive-poll-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victory Geek survey</a> conducted on behalf of The Illinoize, a political blog run by a former GOP strategist who once worked for Davis.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The 15th District won’t feature a competitive general election, but five other districts that could see hard-fought November contests also have notable Republican primaries. We’ll start with the two seats <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1qfnRiuOZ3yok6WGvBHZ9P6u3EMy_LwRv&amp;ll=41.74946091318527%2C-88.37089173520253&amp;z=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that are located</a> downstate or outside of the Chicago area.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the <strong>17th District</strong> in northwestern Illinois, attorney Esther Joy King is heavily favored to win the GOP nomination over insurance broker Charlie Helmick in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos. King, who lost to Bustos by about 4 points in 2020, <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidates/esther-joy-king/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing of national Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IL/17/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has substantially outraised the six candidates</a> competing for the Democratic nomination. This D+4 district is one of the GOP’s best shots at flipping a Democratic-held seat in Illinois.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Democrats drew the <strong>13th District</strong> in south-central Illinois to be a D+7 seat, leading Davis to abandon it. But the GOP could still hold this seat in a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning midterm environment</a>. Republicans look likely to pick either former federal prosecutor Jesse Reising or nonprofit president Regan Deering, as <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IL/13/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ve raised the most money</a> and are on the National Republican Congressional Committee’s list of <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidate-type/on-the-radar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates to watch</a>. Both contenders have deep ties to Decatur, as <a href="https://www.sj-r.com/story/news/politics/elections/candidate-profiles/2022/05/26/illinois-primary-election-jesse-reising-13-th-congressional-district/9738319002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reising’s family has been there</a> for six generations while Deering’s grandfather <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/business/dwayne-o-andreas-former-archer-daniels-midland-chief-dies-at-98.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led farm products giant</a> Archer-Daniels-Midland while it was based there.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Reising might have a slight edge, but it’s difficult to say with no polls available. With $131,000 in the bank, Reising had more money down the stretch than Deering’s $33,000. He’s also <a href="https://www.thelakespringfield.com/2022/05/23/reising-deering-pick-up-endorsements-in-13th-district-gop-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garnered support</a> from many local officials in the district and <a href="https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1529867991403356165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas</a>, not to mention about $120,000 in outside spending support <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=IL13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Americans for Prosperity</a>. For her part, Deering has the backing of two national organizations working to elect Republican women — <a href="http://maggieslist.org/candidates/2022-candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie’s List</a> and <a href="https://viewpac.org/candidates/regan-deering-il-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VIEW PAC</a> — as well as <a href="https://www.decaturtribune.com/2022/05/23/illinois-right-to-life-endorses-regan-deering-for-congress-in-il13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an endorsement</a> from the anti-abortion rights group Illinois Right to Life. The winner will likely face former Biden administration official Nikki Budzinski in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Three suburban-exurban seats located around Chicago could also be in play. Most of the attention in the <strong>6th District</strong> is focused on the Democratic primary between incumbent Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman, but Republicans could make a play for this D+6 seat split between Cook and DuPage counties. The leading GOP contenders appear to be two mayors, Gary Grasso of Burr Ridge and Keith Pekau of Orland Park, although attorney Scott Kaspar is also in the mix.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Grasso <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IL/06/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has led the way in fundraising</a> with $621,000, compared with Pekau’s $375,000 and Kaspar’s $266,000, although Grasso <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL06124/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave his campaign</a> $250,000 to achieve that advantage. Pekau has also received some outside support from the conservative Restoration PAC, which <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=IL06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has spent</a> $100,000 <a href="https://southcooknews.com/stories/627798392-ad-supports-pekau-congressional-run-pekau-cut-costs-lowered-taxes-and-paid-down-the-village-debt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoting him</a>. Yet while Grasso and Pekau have both accepted the 2020 election result, Kaspar <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20220601/some-republicans-in-6th-us-house-race-doubt-biden-won-the-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised doubts about the outcome</a>, helping position himself as arguably the <a href="https://www.shawlocal.com/news/election/2022/06/21/suburban-congressional-candidate-spent-18810-of-campaign-money-to-charter-jet-for-giuliani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trumpiest candidate in the race</a>. Kaspar has also visited Trump’s club at Mar-a-Lago and has the support of former Trump attorney and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. We have no polling to go on here, so it’s hard to say how this primary will play out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the western outskirts of Chicagoland, Republicans hope the national environment will help them capture the <strong>14th District,</strong> a D+7 seat helmed by Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood and her <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8IL14174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.4 million war chest</a>. But it’s anyone’s guess as to who will come out on top among the four notable Republicans in the race: Kendall County Board Chair Scott Gryder, conservative radio host Mike Koolidge, businessman Jack Lombardi and Kendall County GOP Chair Jim Marter. No candidate <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IL/14/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had more than</a> $35,000 in the bank heading into the final weeks of the campaign, and outside groups <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=IL14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t invested here</a>. Gryder <a href="https://www.scottgryder.com/scott-gryder-for-congress-endorsements-and-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attracted</a> a large number of endorsements from current or former local and state elected officials, but Koolidge <a href="https://willcountygazette.com/stories/627803398-congressman-darin-lahood-endorses-mike-koolidge-for-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did just receive the endorsement</a> of Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, and Marter <a href="https://marter4congress.us/2022/03/10/jim-marter-for-congress-announces-major-endorsement-illinois-congresswoman-mary-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the backing</a> of the aforementioned Rep. Mary Miller.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the GOP field seems easier to handicap next door in the D+10 <strong>11th District</strong>, as former Trump administration official Catalina Lauf <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/elections/ct-us-congress-republican-primaries-20220607-jizzw3z3fvdellg7jnbcc36qn4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be the favorite</a> to take on Democratic Rep. Bill Foster in a “reach” seat for Republicans. Lauf <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL16107/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised $1.4 million</a>, far more than any of her five Republican opponents. Lauf narrowly lost a primary for Underwood’s seat back in 2020 and <a href="https://youtu.be/fre1sUXh7WMhttps://youtu.be/fre1sUXh7WM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garnered an appearance</a> at the 2020 Republican National Convention that promoted her as a conservative Hispanic woman. But Jerry Evans, a Christian missionary, has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL11173/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised some money</a> and actually entered the final stretch of the race with more in the bank than Lauf, so she might not have smooth sailing to the GOP nomination.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back on June 7, no one got a majority in two Republican primaries for U.S. House in Mississippi, requiring runoff elections three weeks later. One of these runoffs was expected; the other came as a total surprise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The expected one was in the <strong>4th Congressional District</strong>, where Rep. Steven Palazzo is <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2020/11/13/rep-steven-palazzos-campaign-spending-probed-by-congressional-ethics-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under investigation</a> for allegedly spending nearly $200,000 in campaign funds on himself and his wife. Consequently, he got only 32 percent of the vote in the primary, only 7 percentage points ahead of the second-place finisher, Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell. Even worse for Palazzo, all five of the other Republicans in the primary who didn’t advance to the runoff <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/06/09/steven-palazzo-mike-ezell-runoff-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quickly endorsed Ezell</a>, so it seems likely that the anti-incumbent vote will coalesce around him. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the surprise runoff comes from the <strong>3rd Congressional District</strong>, where former Navy pilot Michael Cassidy finished ahead of Rep. Michael Guest in the primary, 48 percent to 47 percent. There was little sign before the primary that the Republican base was unhappy with Guest, but the staunchly pro-Trump Cassidy had been <a href="https://www.djournal.com/news/state-news/michael-guest-michael-cassidy-runoff-mississippi-ms03/article_6db6ae29-df83-5e31-b086-88565f5fa006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slamming the incumbent</a> for his vote to create the Jan. 6 commission, and it apparently resonated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now that the cat’s out of the bag, though, the cavalry is coming to Guest’s rescue. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House GOP leadership, has spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=MS03&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $400,000</a> against Cassidy, attacking him for briefly supporting Medicare for All. Guest has also <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/06/17/michael-guest-michael-cassidy-mississippi-runoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blasted Cassidy</a> for being a recent transplant to Mississippi. And unlike in the 4th District, the third-place finisher from the Republican primary is actually <a href="https://yallpolitics.com/2022/06/21/griffin-endorses-guest-in-ms03-runoff-after-he-says-cassidy-supporter-threatened-his-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting the incumbent</a> in this runoff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So Guest looks like a better bet than Palazzo to survive, but it’s still possible that either or both of them will join the list of incumbent congressmen going down in defeat on Tuesday. One thing is for sure, though: Whoever wins the Republican runoffs will almost certainly win the general elections in these deeply red seats.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate special election, 2nd Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Oklahoma has two Republican primaries to monitor, both of which will probably go to a runoff on Aug. 23. First, the special election for <strong>Senate</strong> has attracted a <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/content/dam/ok/en/elections/candidate-filing-archives/2022-candidate-filing-archives/2022listbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baker’s dozen of candidates</a> aiming to succeed Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, who announced in February that <a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/oklahoma-sen-jim-inhofe-to-announce-resignation-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he would resign</a> at the end of the current Congress. And because Oklahoma is a deep-red state, the eventual GOP nominee will be a mortal lock to win in November. (The regular election for Oklahoma’s other Senate seat is also taking place, but Republican Sen. James Lankford appears on his way to easily winning renomination and the general election.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The front-runner in the special election is Rep. Markwayne Mullin, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/senate/OK/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has raised</a> the most money ($3 million, $1 million via a candidate loan) and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OK00186/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had $1.1 million in the bank</a> heading into the final weeks of the campaign. Mullin also garnered just shy of 40 percent in two recent surveys, one from <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60099f1f6ffad96a2d94bf98/t/62a76197ffcd647bc06ef765/1655136663898/AI+OK+Statewide+GOP+Primary+-+Crosstab+Results+-+June+2022+-+Public+Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amber Integrated</a> and another from <a href="https://www.newson6.com/story/62b52dc5fadcf807204e3cd8/poll:-race-for-2nd-tightens-in-oklahomas-us-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News 9/News On 6/SoonerPoll</a>, that put him well ahead of the rest of the field but short of the majority required to avoid a runoff. Mullin has a solidly pro-Trump record, having voted against certifying the 2020 election result, in addition to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/stefanik-house-republicans-resolution-trump-impeachment-expunge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing legislation</a> to expunge Trump’s impeachments. His <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/22/markwayne-mullin-senate-campaign-00019112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“fighter” profile</a> may also be appealing to voters: As a former mixed martial artist, Mullin is a member of the Oklahoma chapter of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he drew headlines last year when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mullin-afghanistan-trip/2021/08/31/62f63bb0-0a90-11ec-a256-709238a1404d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he attempted to enter Afghanistan</a> to evacuate a group of Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the race for second place is former state House speaker T.W. Shannon, <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/fellows/tw-shannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Black person</a> to hold that office. Shannon placed second in recent polls, and he <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OK00210/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $961,000 while <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00812545/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also benefiting</a> from $1.7 million in outside spending by a super PAC supporting his bid. Four others are chasing Shannon for the other potential runoff slot, though: state Sen. Nathan Dahm, Inhofe’s chief of staff Luke Holland, former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and physician Randy Grellner. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dahm <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OK00145/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> only $374,000, but Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul’s super PAC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00657866/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has splashed</a> $1 million on his behalf. Holland, who has <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2022/02/25/sen-jim-inhofe-oklahoma-endorses-chief-staff-luke-holland-successor/6930792001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inhofe’s endorsement</a>, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OK00194/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> $1.2 million and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00799866/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also received</a> $572,000 in outside support. Pruitt <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OK00277/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t raised much</a> money, but the former Oklahoma attorney general was part of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/15/scott-pruitt-oklahoma-senate-epa-trump-00025628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s cabinet</a>, where he was beset with ethics scandals while pursuing a deregulatory agenda. Finally, Grellner hasn’t polled much support, but <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2OK00251/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he has donated</a> $1 million to his campaign and <a href="https://twitter.com/reesejgorman/status/1537427384831561729?s=20&amp;t=6wYQ28NznGyPCzHzY3z9Vw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has attacked Shannon</a> for being too cozy with casino magnates and <a href="https://twitter.com/reesejgorman/status/1537427752823013378?s=20&amp;t=6wYQ28NznGyPCzHzY3z9Vw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the other candidates</a> for being “career politicians.” That said, the fragmented field might help Shannon stay ahead.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Mullin’s Senate bid has also opened up the <strong>2nd District</strong> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/oklahoma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in eastern Oklahoma</a>, one of the reddest seats in the country at R+55. This contest has attracted 14 Republican contenders, too, making a runoff likely. And notably, most of the major candidates have self-funded a great deal: About $1.9 million (60 percent) of the $3.1 million raised by the entire field has come from candidate loans to their own campaigns. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There seem to be nine candidates of significance, although we have no polling to differentiate them. The leading fundraiser is energy businessman Guy Barker, who is also secretary-treasurer of the Quapaw Nation (eastern Oklahoma <a href="https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/charts/24?state=OK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a sizable Native American population</a>). But Barker has <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OK02281/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loaned himself nearly all</a> of the $821,000 he’s raised. Pharmacy executive Chris Schiller doesn’t have as much money on hand, but he’s raised the most from contributors ($365,000); he also <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2OK02190/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loaned himself</a> $250,000. Three current state legislators are also in the race: state Rep. Avery Frix, state Sen. Marty Quinn and state Rep. Dustin Roberts. Frix has raised the third-most in the field with $417,000 (helped by $245,000 in self-funding) while Roberts and Quinn have raised roughly $160,000 and $200,000, respectively, with each throwing in around $25,000 from their own pockets. Both Frix and Schiller <a href="https://www.facebook.com/voteaveryfrix/videos/559419215501668/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have especially played up</a> their <a href="https://twitter.com/reesejgorman/status/1521912059851587587?s=20&amp;t=7cXroDgA_EG7QstfPijamw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Trump</a> in recent ads.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, former state Sen. Josh Brecheen has mostly made his mark <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=OK02&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via $597,000</a> on <a href="https://www.muskogeepolitico.com/2022/06/club-for-growth-group-jumps-in-to-boost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ads sponsored by the School Freedom Fund</a>, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Club for Growth <a href="https://www.wral.com/school-choice-pac-floods-nc-airwaves-in-heated-us-senate-gop-primary/20248238/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that supports</a> giving taxpayer money for school choice. Former Oklahoma GOP chairman Rep. John Bennett is also running, and <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2022/04/15/john-bennett-oklahoma-republican-party-chairman-resigns-campaign-congress/7335987001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s been a lightning rod</a>, once comparing COVID-19 vaccine mandates to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. Additionally, Muskogee Police Chief Johnny Teehee and Cherokee Tribal Councilor Wes Nofire are <a href="https://www.muskogeephoenix.com/news/teehee-announces-bid-for-congress/article_2ab7aa62-a636-11ec-b2b2-a7b76cfa1d7f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two other contenders</a> with connections to the Native American community. Considering the size of the field, it’s nigh impossible to handicap favorites, so this could be a wild one.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 3rd, 5th, 7th and 8th congressional districts; governor; secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Colorado is another busy state for Republicans, with three statewide and four congressional primaries to watch. Each state-level race appears to favor Democrats in the D+6 state, but the contests could become more — or less — competitive depending on whom Republicans nominate. This is perhaps most true in the <strong>Senate</strong> primary, where state Rep. Ron Hanks and businessman Joe O’Dea are battling for the GOP nomination to take on two-term Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hanks, a <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2021/11/20/colorado-lawmaker-seeks-2020-election-audit-in-lawsuit-against-griswold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fervent denier of the 2020 election</a>, has attracted support from conservative elements in the GOP, but whether he has the resources to win statewide is an open question. Hanks <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/ron-hanks-takes-top-spot-in-colorado-s-republican-us-senate-primary/article_cfa0bf20-b86d-11ec-a572-c3c90593bbd1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified for the ballot</a> via the activist-dominated pre-primary convention, but as of June 8, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2CO00233/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he had raised a piddling</a> $125,000. O’Dea, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/joe-odea-makes-colorados-republican-us-senate-primary-ballot-by-petition/article_2ddf06d6-b455-11ec-aeba-5fd570bd3b50.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose to qualify for the ballot</a> by petition rather than by the pre-primary convention route, and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2CO00241/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s raised</a> $2.3 million, including $500,000 in self-funding.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Democrats have tried to boost Hanks in the belief that he would be a much weaker general election candidate than O’Dea, especially considering Bennet has about $7 million <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0CO00211/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his campaign account</a>. For instance, the super PAC Democratic Colorado <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00817015/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has spent</a> $2 million opposing Hanks, funding <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1534523420385452036?s=20&amp;t=uS5dQ7NoMx0M8HettetKbQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Hanks ads</a> clearly meant <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/09/dems-meddle-in-colorado-senate-gop-primary-00038294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to encourage Republican voters</a> to support the “too conservative” Hanks. Meanwhile, the same super PAC has spent $2 million <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/12437f6d-0e5e-422a-acaf-12643e32e085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on ads portraying</a> O’Dea as supportive of President Biden and Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The only primary poll we’ve seen, though, is an <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/06/colorado-senate-primary-hanks-odea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O’Dea-sponsored survey</a> conducted by Public Opinion Strategies that found O’Dea leading Hanks 38 percent to 14 percent. However, that survey was conducted before most of the recent spending. That said, one wrinkle that might help O’Dea is that Colorado allows registered independents to vote in party primaries, and with <a href="https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/vote/primaryCandidates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zero contested statewide Democratic primaries</a> on the ballot this year, some moderate independents might vote in the Republican primary, which <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/06/13/harden-colorados-unaffiliated-voters-may-help-save-republicans-from-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could boost O’Dea</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Colorado’s Senate primary isn’t the only race where we’ve seen Democratic meddling. The GOP primary for <strong>governor</strong>, where University of Colorado Regent Heidi Ganahl faces businessman Greg Lopez for the right to challenge Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in November, has also caught Democrats’ attention. Ganahl, the only Republican statewide-elected official in Colorado, is a stronger fundraiser than Lopez — <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?OrgID=40971&amp;Type=CO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’s raised</a> about $1 million <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?OrgID=36764&amp;Type=CO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Lopez’s</a> $123,000 — and would likely be the GOP’s better general election choice. But Democrats would prefer to take on Lopez, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/04/09/greg-lopez-heidi-ganahl-colorado-governer-primary-gop/?link_id=35&amp;can_id=8094ef3ca9e2fe4af466070f61a27eb7&amp;source=email-morning-digest-why-trump-pick-needs-to-defend-her-bona-fides-to-get-back-on-primary-ballot&amp;email_referrer=email_1508093&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-why-trump-pick-needs-to-defend-her-bona-fides-to-get-back-on-primary-ballot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another 2020 election denier</a>. A Democratic super PAC <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/14/democratic-governors-association-greg-lopez-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funded in part by the DGA</a> has spent $1.5 million on television and internet ads aimed at — stop me if you’ve heard this before — portraying Lopez as “too conservative” for Colorado.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s no primary polling available, but Lopez could make things interesting, given the spending by Democrats and his Trumpy profile (Ganahl <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/06/20/heidi-ganahl-is-some-republicans-latest-hope-for-colorado-can-she-get-past-the-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has accepted the 2020 election result</a>). Still, Lopez doesn’t have an auspicious track record, having won only 13 percent <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Results/Abstract/2018/primary/republican/governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 2018 Republican primary for governor</a>. Ganahl also has taken steps to protect her right flank, calling for the rollback of <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/06/17/heidi-ganahl-candidate-for-colorado-governor-on-abortion-gun-policy-mental-health-care-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state laws protecting abortion rights</a> and <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/06/06/gop-governor-candidates-take-aim-at-polis-at-conspiracy-fueled-western-conservative-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appearing at the Western Conservative Summit</a>, a conference featuring many far-right and conspiracy-theorist voices. Regardless of who wins, though, the eventual GOP nominee will face an uphill battle against Polis, who has <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/04/28/governor-approval-ratings-2022-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fairly strong approval rating</a> in the state and great personal wealth <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/01/25/colorado-jared-polis-spending-big-reelection-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to help fund his campaign</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other statewide race on our radar is the Republican primary for <strong>secretary of state</strong>, which involves Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, former Jefferson County Clerk Pam Anderson and nonprofit leader Mike O’Donnell. (The eventual winner will face Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold in November.) This office oversees state elections, and it looks like Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-an-election-official-believes-the-big-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might nominate Peters</a>, a candidate who has not only promoted debunked conspiracy theories about the 2022 election, but whom <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/11/tina-peters-colorado-elections-clerk-barred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state courts removed</a> from managing the elections in her home county because of breaches in election security, which also resulted in <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/03/09/mesa-clerk-tina-peters-charged-by-grand-jury-in-election-security-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 indictments against her</a>. In other words, she cannot do the job at home that she now wants to do for all of Colorado.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet Peters could very well win the GOP nomination. We don’t have any polling, but she <a href="https://www.cologop.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SOS-20220409-161917.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced out of the pre-primary convention</a> with 61 percent to O’Donnell’s 39 percent (Anderson <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/pam-anderson-qualifies-for-gop-primary-against-tina-peters-for-colorado-secretary-of-state/article_5af7464c-b45a-11ec-8d00-a7b23d7cc956.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified via petition</a>). Peters has also outraised her opponents, <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?Type=CA&amp;SeqID=53293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing in</a> $175,000 compared with $112,000 <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?Type=CA&amp;SeqID=52137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for Anderson</a> and $55,000 <a href="https://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CandidateDetail.aspx?Type=CA&amp;SeqID=52501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for O’Donnell</a>. It may also help that she has two opponents potentially splitting the anti-Peters vote. For her part, Anderson <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/08/2022-republican-secretary-of-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepts the 2020 election result</a> and has promised to bring greater professionalism to the office, while O’Donnell won’t say whether the 2020 result was legitimate and wants to undo some of Colorado’s recent expansion of voting access.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Four U.S. House primaries are also on our watchlist, two of which are open-seat races in competitive seats. To start, the GOP has a good shot at picking up the new <strong>8th District</strong> north of Denver, an R+3 seat, and Republican voters there will choose among state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, Thornton Mayor Jan Kulmann, Weld County Commissioner Lori Saine and retired Army Green Beret Tyler Allcorn. We lack polling, but the fundraising numbers portend a fairly wide-open race. Kulman <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO08095/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has led with</a> $470,000, followed by <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO08103/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allcorn’s</a> $349,000 (about half self-funded), <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO08079/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirkmeyer’s</a> $338,000 and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO08061/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saine’s</a> $297,000 (a little over a quarter self-funded). Kirkmeyer may have the financial upper hand, however, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=CO08&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to</a> $531,000 in outside spending support from Americans for Prosperity and a super PAC backing her candidacy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Once again, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/16/8th-congressional-district-tv-ad-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are also trying</a> to boost <a href="https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/democrats-fund-ads-boosting-controversial-gop-candidates-in-critical-colorado-primaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Republican</a> they view as easiest to beat: Saine, <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2020/12/15/colorado-election-integrity-hearing-no-evidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who has dabbled</a> in election conspiracies and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/166852/pelosi-boosting-mastriano-lori-saine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has used messaging</a> like “The Biden-Harris-Schumer-Pelosi gang’s Socialist-Communist Agenda” in election materials. Democratic outside groups House Majority PAC and 314 Action have spent $251,000 either <a href="https://youtu.be/_UhDfmEbHqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ostensibly attacking Saine</a> as “way too conservative” or even supporting her. Kirkmeyer has been ensnared in this, too, as 314 Action <a href="https://youtu.be/p5SCU6astsY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has run ads</a> attacking her for not supporting Trump or his election lies — Kirkmeyer <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/07/colorado-8th-congressional-district-republicans-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has accepted</a> the 2020 election outcome — while a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00797720/independent-expenditures/2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirkmeyer ally spent</a> $80,000 attacking <a href="https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2022/06/republican-super-pac-falsely-claims-right-winger-lori-saine-is-a-liberal/46283/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both Saine and Kulman</a> as “liberals.” However it plays out, the eventual Republican nominee will meet Democratic state Rep. Yadira Caraveo in what should be a very competitive general election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Colorado’s other competitive seat is the D+6 <strong>7th District</strong> west of Denver, which is open following Democratic Rep. Ed Perlmutter’s retirement. GOP primary voters will pick from economist Tim Reichert, former oil and gas executive Erik Aadland and former state legislative candidate Laurel Imer. Reichert has the most money, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO07204/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having raised</a> $1 million (half from his own pocket), and <a href="https://youtu.be/LQg7G1YrMRQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s used his background</a> in economics and business to criticize high inflation. Aadland, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO07170/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> $492,000 (around a quarter self-funded) and has <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/06/09/colorado-congressional-district-7-election-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted his experience</a> as an Army veteran, support for border security and the Second Amendment. Finally, Imer <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO07162/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> only $87,000 but <a href="https://gazette.com/election-coverage/colorado-candidates-for-congressional-district-7-talk-about-their-priorities-experience/article_44ce7f58-e2df-11ec-baa7-2fb32ace796c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has portrayed herself</a> as the Trumpiest candidate in the field. Reichert is probably the favorite — national Republicans <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidates/tim-reichert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are keeping an eye on him</a> — but we have no polling to suggest which candidate is most likely to face Democratic state Sen. Brittany Pettersen.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two incumbent Republicans also have notable primary challengers. First, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert faces state Sen. Don Coram in the GOP primary for the <strong>3rd District</strong>, an R+15 seat covering western and southern Colorado. Boebert has <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/04/lauren-boebert-don-coram-colorado-congressional-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courted controversy</a> since winning in 2020 and has drawn a ton of eyeballs doing it, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0CO03165/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $5 million for her campaign</a>. Although Boebert has a <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/06/08/lauren-boebert-investigation-mileage-colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simmering scandal involving mileage reimbursement</a> from her campaign account, she’s a clear favorite over Coram, who <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO03328/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has raised</a> just $229,000. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/theview/video/election-deniers-dominating-primaries-colorado-fivethirtyeight-85874712</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But the state senator is trying an unorthodox primary approach — he’s promising to bring people together and reduce partisan animosity. <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/06/07/lauren-boebert-2022-elections-democrats-unaffiliated-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An unusually large number</a> of Democratic registered voters in the district have switched to independent, perhaps a sign that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/us/politics/boebert-colorado-primary-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they intend to vote</a> in the GOP primary against Boebert. However, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-liz-cheney-cant-rely-on-democrats-to-save-her-in-wyomings-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve discussed in Rep. Liz Cheney’s reelection battle</a>, that probably won’t make a difference unless Coram can win over a lot more Republicans than we expect.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The most endangered GOP incumbent is eight-term Rep. Doug Lamborn, who represents the R+18 <strong>5th District</strong> around Colorado Springs. Lamborn’s main primary opponent is state Rep. Dave Williams, although businessman Andrew Heaton and Navy veteran Rebecca Keltie are also running. Despite sporting a <a href="https://voteview.com/person/20704/doug-lamborn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly conservative record</a>, Lamborn won barely more than 50 percent of the vote in <a href="https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/Results/Abstract/pdf/2000-2099/2014AbstractBook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 2014</a> and <a href="https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/Results/2018/2018PrimaryCertAndResults.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 primaries</a>, and he <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/01/24/substantial-reason-to-believe-rep-lamborn-violated-congressional-ethics-investigation-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces an ethics investigation</a> over his alleged use of official resources for personal matters. So there might be an opening for Williams, who <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/dave-williams-primary-doug-lamborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has promised to be a conservative fighter</a> in Congress. Although Williams <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2CO05216/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only raised</a> about $196,000 (about half of which is self-funded), Lamborn <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6CO05159/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has brought in</a> $353,000, which is meager for an incumbent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Lamborn-Williams race <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/04/27/colorado-elections-2022-congressional-district-5-doug-lamborn-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has turned ugly</a>, too. Lamborn had planned to compete at the pre-primary convention in early April, but <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/el-paso-gop-chair-attacks-lamborn-after-he-cites-troubling-irregularities-in-assembly-process/article_e8f107f0-b1d3-11ec-bc7e-9b9328f0cb98.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he then claimed there were</a> “troubling irregularities” that suggested the El Paso County GOP was working to help Williams, so Lamborn instead qualified for the primary via petition. The local party chairwoman, a Williams ally, excoriated Lamborn for withdrawing from the convention and his accusations of malfeasance. Then in early June, Lamborn <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2022/calling-claims-false-williams-demands-stations-stop-airing-lamborn-ads-as-gop-primary-heats-up/article_e126d806-e685-11ec-8c13-57707642baf8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started running ads</a> saying the Trump 2020 campaign in Colorado had fired Williams, which led Williams to demand TV stations stop airing the ad. Williams <a href="https://youtu.be/d3msRL4_Apk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has since fired back with an ad</a> attacking Lamborn for lying and promoting Williams as a pro-Trump candidate. With multiple challengers in the race, Lamborn may survive again, but there’s a path for Williams to topple the incumbent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s be clear: Republicans are very unlikely to win the <strong>governorship</strong> of New York this year. The state has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+20, and both <a href="http://www.insideelections.com/ratings/governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Elections</a> and the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cook Political Report</a> rate the race as “Solid” Democratic. However, the GOP gubernatorial primary for still has a couple of interesting names that make it worth watching.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On paper, Rep. Lee Zeldin should be the <a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/state/11403-republican-governor-primary-race-zeldin-giuliani-astorino-wilson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runaway favorite</a>; he has raised more money from individual contributions than any other Republican (about $10 million), and he has the <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/03/ny-gop-officially-backs-zeldin-governor-2022/362609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official backing</a> of the state Republican Party. However, former Trump aide Andrew Giuliani — Rudy’s son — is a wild card. He has raised less than a million dollars, but a <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SNY-June-2022-Poll-Release-6-16-22-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Siena College poll</a> found that he had higher name recognition and a higher net favorability rating<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Favorable rating minus unfavorable rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> than Zeldin among Republicans. (Fifty percent of New York Republicans viewed Giuliani favorably, versus 28 percent who viewed him unfavorably; for Zeldin, that split was 36 percent versus 21 percent.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Giuliani is also the Trumpiest candidate in the field. He <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/06/21/gop-candidates-for-governor-on-the-attack-during-spectrum-news-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> that he believes Trump was the true winner of the 2020 election, while Zeldin has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/18/lee-zeldin-biden-election-playbook-interview-476949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishy-washy</a> on the issue. By contrast, only one candidate has affirmed that Biden fairly won the election: businessman Harry Wilson. Wilson is also an interesting figure: a pro-choice “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/21/new-york-governor-election-harry-wilson-00032221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockefeller Republican</a>,” the sort who used to succeed in New York politics. If he were to win the nomination, he’s the one candidate who might actually make the general election competitive — but despite spending almost $11 million of his own money on his campaign, he has had trouble appealing to an increasingly uncompromising Republican electorate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to an <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/new-york-2022-zeldin-hochul-matchup-likely-for-new-york-governor-s-seat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson College poll</a> conducted June 9-10, Zeldin had 34 percent support in the primary, former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino had 16 percent, Wilson had 15 percent, and Giuliani had 13 percent. However, the <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=08947348-55ff-42bc-8c05-3dd427d2e9b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> — conducted June 15-20 by SurveyUSA for WHEC-TV and WNYT-TV — showed Zeldin and Giuliani in a dead heat, 25 percent to 23 percent. We will see on Tuesday night whether that poll is an outlier or picked up on a real trend.</p>

Mike Lee should win renomination on Tuesday, but he faces two notable challengers who could cut into his margin. <p>Chris Samuels / The Salt Lake Tribune via AP</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Utah</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate, 1st Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Incumbent Mike Lee shouldn’t have much trouble getting renominated to the <strong>U.S. Senate</strong>, but with former Republican presidential candidate Evan McMullin running against him as an independent in the general election, it will be interesting to see how much support Lee’s primary opponents draw. The <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/5/19/23130938/how-republican-race-senate-shaping-utah-new-poll-mike-lee-becky-edwards-hinckley-institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> of the race is from all the way back in May, but it showed Lee receiving only 49 percent of the vote, with his opponents getting a combined 25 percent and 26 percent undecided — hardly an indication that Republicans are united behind him.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lee’s opponents, former state Rep. Becky Edwards and businesswoman Ally Isom, <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/6/1/23150445/utah-mike-lee-ally-isom-becky-edwards-us-senate-debate-republican-primary-gop-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely share Lee’s down-the-line conservative views</a>. (One notable exception: Edwards was not in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade.) But they have still attacked him for being too much of a partisan pitbull; in particular, they’ve taken Lee to task for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/mike-lee-chip-roy-text-messages-jan-6-mark-meadows-overturn-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategizing with the Trump White House</a> about challenging the results of the 2020 election in the immediate aftermath of the vote. While Lee eventually voted to certify the election, Edwards especially has been more forceful about condemning Lee’s involvement. Not your typical Republican primary challenge — but then again, this is famously Trump-skeptical Utah. The state’s other senator, remember, is Mitt Romney.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be safe, we’re also keeping an eye on the GOP primary in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the deep-red</a> <strong>1st District</strong> in northern Utah, where first-term Rep. Blake Moore faces retired intelligence officer Andrew Badger and former Morgan County Councilmember Tina Cannon. Moore <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/UT/01/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has far more money</a> than his opponents, but he won <a href="https://voteinfo.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2020/07/2020-Primary-Election-Canvass.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 2020 primary</a> with only 31 percent and has <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/6/2/23151726/debate-1st-congressional-district-blake-moore-tina-cannon-andrew-badger-republican-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced criticism</a> that he hasn’t fought hard enough against Biden’s administration. The activist-dominated <a href="https://utgop.org/convention-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-primary convention even gave</a> Badger more support, 59 percent to Moore’s 41 percent, advancing both to the primary (Cannon <a href="https://www.standard.net/news/government/2022/apr/06/tina-cannon-joins-blake-moore-on-primary-ballot-in-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified via petition</a>). But Moore is still favored, as a <a href="https://www.standard.net/news/2022/jun/02/moores-internal-poll-shows-he-has-a-wide-lead-in-u-s-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey conducted</a> for Moore’s campaign and a <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/6/21/23176879/who-ahead-utah-1st-3rd-congressional-district-republican-races-new-poll-primary-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Dan Jones &amp; Associates</a> on behalf of the Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics both found him clearing 50 percent.</p>

Mike Flood should easily win in Nebraska’s special election, but the lines the race is being held under are unusual, to say the least. <p>Kenneth Ferriera / Lincoln Journal Star via AP</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Nebraska</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Special election for the 1st Congressional District</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, a little piece of bonus electoral action for you (as if 30 Democratic and Republican primaries weren’t enough): Tuesday will also bring a special general election for Nebraska’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>. This seat became vacant in March after <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/26/fortenberry-resigns-two-days-after-jury-finds-him-guilty-of-lying-to-federal-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry resigned</a> just days after being convicted on charges of lying to federal agents who were investigating illegal donations to his campaign. Because this is a solidly red seat (with a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+17), Republican candidate state Sen. Mike Flood should easily dispatch Democratic candidate state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks, but that isn’t what’s most interesting about this race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s odd is that the special election is <a href="https://sos.nebraska.gov/elections/2022-special-election-us-congressional-district-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being conducted</a> within the boundaries of the <em>new</em>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nebraska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-redistricting</a> 1st District — despite the fact that the winner of the special election will finish the term that Fortenberry was elected to in 2020 under the <em>old</em> district lines. This is very unusual, as ordinarily when a special election is held in a redistricting year, the special election is held using the old lines because those lines are still operative until the very last day of the active congressional session (in this case, Jan. 3, 2023). For example, every other special election this year has been or will be conducted under the boundaries that were used in 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nebraska’s new congressional map, though, passed with an <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/107/PDF/Slip/LB1_S1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergency clause</a> that meant the new lines took effect almost immediately — on <a href="https://www.nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=32-504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oct. 1, 2021</a>. “Once the Nebraska Legislature passed the new redistricting lines, the old district lines are no longer in place” for electoral purposes, Deputy Nebraska Secretary of State Cindi Allen wrote in an email to FiveThirtyEight. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Allen clarified that the old lines do apply to representation and constituent services until January 2023. In other words, the special election will be decided by the voters of the new 1st District, but the winner will represent the voters of the old 1st District. That means that <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjVA5g1bmZVDgTvwBpoZCSoEKLyhV7az3NVSlduUvzE/edit#gid=762862948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75,430 Nebraskans</a> who were in the old 1st District but are not in the new one will not be eligible to vote for who represents them in Congress for the next six months. (And, on the other side of the coin, many of the 69,436 Nebraskans who live in the new 1st District but not the old one will vote in an election that has no bearing on them whatsoever.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Allen called this an “anomaly,” but it may be worse than that — by denying some otherwise eligible voters in the old 1st District the right to choose their next representative, it may be illegal as well. “This makes no sense at all,” said Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. “Some people will effectively end up with two representatives and others with none.” However, both Li and law professor Rick Hasen said that the situation is so unusual, it’s hard to know how a court might rule if the election were challenged. And with the election taking place literally today, it would seem that it is fated to be decided in this unusual manner, legally or not.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, there will be no shortage of election results to sift through on Tuesday night as we learn the results, so join us for what is sure to be an action-packed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a>, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">This installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a> covers the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Americans’ constitutional right to an abortion. Which states have abortion bans in place already, how have Americans across the political spectrum responded and how could this decision affect the midterm elections? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The crew also analyzes two more notable opinions released by the Supreme Court in the past few days: a ruling on gun restrictions in New York that has significant implications for gun control in five other states and Washington, D.C., and a ruling on prayer at public schools.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the team outlines Tuesday’s biggest primary elections in Illinois, New York, Colorado, Oklahoma and Utah.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By the end of the day on Tuesday, 29.5 states — why do you always have to make things difficult, <a href="https://13wham.com/news/local/new-york-summer-primary-election-split-into-two" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>? — will have held their 2022 primary elections. But we still have to get through Tuesday first! On June 28, voters in Colorado, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma and Utah head to the polls (or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-18-states-with-all-mail-elections.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mail in their ballots</a>) for primaries; Mississippi and South Carolina will also hold runoff elections; and Nebraska will even be holding a special election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are dozens of races to watch, so we’ll be bringing them to you in two parts, starting with all the Democratic primaries of note on the ballot this week. And there’s truly something for everyone: an incumbent running against an incumbent. Several progressive-versus-moderate skirmishes. The cryptocurrency industry trying to pick sides. Multiple chances to elect new female, nonwhite or LGBT candidates to Congress. Let’s dive right in!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1241197250-711.jpg" alt="Kina Collins campaigns in Chicago" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1241197250-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1241197250-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1241197250-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>There are a number of progressive vs. incumbent battles in Illinois on Tuesday, including in the 7th District, where 31-year-old activist Kina Collins (pictured on the left) is taking on 13-term Rep. Danny Davis. <p>Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune / Tribune News Service via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Illinois</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 13th and 17th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least one, and possibly as many as three, Democratic incumbent U.S. representatives from Illinois will go down in defeat on Tuesday. The one guaranteed loss will come in the <strong>6th District</strong>, where two incumbents — Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman — are vying for the same seat. After <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a> radically redrew the Chicago suburbs, Newman (who currently represents the 3rd District) found her home placed <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/10/28/22751941/marie-newman-jesus-chuy-garcia-same-district-new-democratic-illinois-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the new 4th District</a> — but a plurality of her current constituents live in the new 6th, so that’s where she decided to <a href="https://capitolfax.com/2021/10/29/marie-newman-mapped-into-the-4th-cd-says-she-will-run-for-reelection-in-6th-district-likely-against-sean-casten/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for reelection</a>. (Members of Congress do not have to live in the district they represent.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Casten is in the opposite situation; he lives in the new 6th, but only a fraction of his current constituents have stayed there with him. In all, 41 percent of the new 6th District are Newman constituents, while only 23 percent are Casten constituents, which (ironically) gives her the appearance of home-field advantage. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, among people likely to vote in a Democratic primary, Newman’s advantage isn’t as large. Thirty-six percent of 6th District residents who voted for President Biden in 2020 are Newman constituents, while 28 percent are Casten constituents. And a lot of those Newman constituents might not even be big fans of hers. Newman got to Congress in 2020 by primarying former Rep. Dan Lipinski, a conservative Democrat. And according to <a href="https://twitter.com/NapervillePol/status/1454166163068526596?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local analyst William Xin</a>, the parts of her old district that are in the new 6th actually voted for Lipinski in that primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both <a href="https://voteview.com/person/22144/marie-newman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newman</a> and <a href="https://voteview.com/person/21906/sean-casten" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casten</a> have very liberal voting records, but in the primary Newman is again positioning herself as the <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/illinois-6th-congressional-district-newman-casten-face-off-in-democratic-primary/2853839/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more progressive option</a>. For example, Casten has long <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/02/02/sean-casten-climate-policy-rap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritized climate change</a> and has been endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters, but only Newman supports the Green New Deal. And while Casten has a <a href="https://twitter.com/VoteCasten/status/1526577426410754048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfect rating</a> from abortion-rights groups, Newman has <a href="https://twitter.com/Marie4Congress/status/1526556384615182340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contrasted</a> her personal experience of getting an abortion in the 1980s with Casten’s past vote for “anti-choice” Republican President George H.W. Bush.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Casten’s supporters have <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/b1978c4e-dc6d-4e43-9b6e-9213b5237549" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked Newman</a> for a <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-marie-newman-house-investigation-20211210-kd5qyycnafgrbjzq7dvnxspm5m-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bribery scandal</a> that emerged out of her 2020 campaign. According to the Office of Congressional Ethics, there is “<a href="https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/OCE%20Reports%20and%20Findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial reason to believe</a>” that Newman offered one of her opponents a job in her congressional office in exchange for dropping out of the campaign (which he did), a potential violation of federal law. Casten has the financial advantage, too: He’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8IL06139/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.2 million</a> for his campaign, while Newman has taken in just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8IL03102/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 million</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Amid all the mudslinging, this is still an unpredictable primary, though. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GSGBhRiBE4u5dZYwYgwR_o2JjaDCy0x9/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> we have is from over a month ago; it gave Casten a 36 percent to 27 percent lead, but it was also sponsored by the Casten campaign. Given that internal polls are usually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too good to be true</a> for their sponsors, this race is best thought of as a toss-up.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two other Chicago-area districts feature the type of Democratic primary we are more accustomed to: a single incumbent vs. a progressive insurgent. There are no public polls in either race, but the tea leaves suggest that the more serious challenge is probably in the <strong>7th District</strong>, where 31-year-old activist Kina Collins is taking on 13-term Rep. Danny Davis. Davis has previously courted controversy with <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/05/louis-farrakhan-democrat-danny-davis-barack-obama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments praising</a> anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, but he defeated Collins handily in their first primary tangle in 2020, 60 percent to 14 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unlike in 2020, though, Collins is going into election day with a financial advantage: Not only has she outraised Davis <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0IL07167/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$613,417</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H4IL07037/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$459,186</a>, but perhaps more importantly, she had outspent him almost 4-to-1 as of June 8 (however, Davis still had plenty of money in the bank at that time that he may have deployed since). The progressive group Justice Democrats has also spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=IL07&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$290,000</a> on Collins’s behalf. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over in the <strong>8th District</strong>, businessman Junaid Ahmed has raised an even more impressive <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL08146/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.1 million</a> — but his opponent, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, has reeled in a whopping <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6IL08147/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.5 million</a> (and he’s been spending it too). Another sign that Ahmed faces an uphill battle: Only one major progressive group, <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>, has stuck its neck out for him, while at least three (<a href="https://justicedemocrats.com/candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Democrats</a>, <a href="https://indivisible.org/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indivisible</a> and the <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/political-endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunrise Movement</a>) have endorsed Collins in the 7th, suggesting they may sense a better opportunity there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The remaining Democratic primaries to watch in the Land of Lincoln are open seats — including two safely Democratic seats where the primary will effectively determine their next representative. First up is (appropriately) the <strong>1st District</strong>, a majority-Black seat on the South Side of Chicago. The seat has a storied past: In 1928, it became the first district outside the South to elect a <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Data/Black-American-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black representative</a>, and for almost two decades hence the 1st District’s representative was the only Black member of Congress. The district has had a Black representative ever since, and that streak will almost certainly continue with its new representative in 2023.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The only question is <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/a-rush-to-be-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who it will be</a>. The open seat has attracted what feels like every ambitious politician on the South Side — 17 Democrats in all — and at least five of them have a legitimate chance of winning. <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-illinois-congressional-candidate-20220208-aq5ceitxhnay3ervvsmp4ligbq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business owner and nonprofit leader</a> Jonathan Swain is the top fundraiser, with <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL01331/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$543,199</a>; Chicago Alderman Pat Dowell is not far behind (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL01281/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$531,812</a>) and entered the race with a <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2022/1/4/22867700/ald-dowell-verge-of-running-bobby-rush-congress-seat-would-drop-secretary-of-state-bid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready-made campaign operation</a> thanks to her prior campaign for secretary of state. Meanwhile, Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership CEO Karin Norington-Reaves <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2022/1/13/22882163/bobby-rush-endorses-karin-norington-reaves-democratic-primary-1st-congressional-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snagged the endorsement</a> of the district’s retiring incumbent, Rep. Bobby Rush, and has benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=IL01&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $800,000</a> in super PAC spending, and longtime state Sen. Jacqueline Collins <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2022/3/3/22960766/state-sen-jacqueline-collins-launches-run-for-congress-bobby-rush-seat-backed-by-father-mike-pfleger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered the race</a> with the backing of several powerful Chicago and Springfield powerbrokers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the campaign has arguably most revolved around businessman Jonathan Jackson, the son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson and brother of former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who represented part of this district until his <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/chi-brother-rep-jackson-to-announce-resignation-20121121-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resignation due to scandal</a> in 2012. Jackson has the benefit of not only his family name, but also the endorsements of major progressive figures like <a href="https://jonathanjacksonforcongress.com/senator-bernie-sanders-endorses-jonathan-jackson-in-the-illinois-1st-congressional-district-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>. Two outside groups with ties to the cryptocurrency industry have also spent <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2022/6/21/23177138/cryptocurrency-pac-money-jonathan-jackson-congress-ftx-web3-forward-bankman-fried" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 million</a> to help him get elected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While each of these things may have downsides as well as upsides (for example, Norington-Reaves has tried to tie Jackson to the unpopular “defund the police” movement, and the cryptocurrency money drew attention to his <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2022/6/20/23175891/house-primary-rivals-blast-jonathan-jackson-personal-financial-disclosure-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure to disclose his personal finances</a>), Jackson will need only a small but vocal plurality in order to win in such a crowded field. And he might get it: A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oq6pcpY8YyPphSjyUDJyD3BpX-SmoSOC/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May internal poll</a> from the Collins campaign listed Jackson in first place, with 19 percent, albeit within the margin of error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The other safely Democratic open seat is also a majority-minority district — but in contrast to the 1st District, this one is brand new. The <strong>3rd District</strong> was redrawn to be plurality-Hispanic, giving Chicago two predominantly Latino seats for the first time. As a result, for the first time, Illinois will almost certainly elect a second Hispanic representative, joining 4th District Rep. Chuy García.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though there are four Democrats in the running, this primary is really just another <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-3rd-congressional-district-20220411-cnie64rqtnd57azyebql4bk4hm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive-versus-moderate showdown</a> between state Rep. Delia Ramirez and Chicago Alderman Gilbert Villegas. Ramirez enjoys the support of a <a href="https://www.deliaforcongress.com/endorsements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundry list of progressive powerbrokers</a> — Sanders, García, Sen. Elizabeth Warren — while Villegas has stressed the need to “reach across the aisle…to get things done.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the money is flying: Villegas has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL03154/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$949,927</a>, while VoteVets (Villegas is a Marine Corps veteran) and Democratic Majority for Israel have combined to spend <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=IL03&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1.1 million</a> either for Villegas or against Ramirez. For her part, Ramirez has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL03162/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$616,213</a> and benefited from $1.6 million in outside spending from the likes of the Working Families Party and Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC. There hasn’t been a public poll since March, so either side could plausibly notch a win here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, Illinois Democrats will also pick nominees to go up against Republicans in a pair of competitive open seats. The primary doesn’t look all that competitive in the <strong>13th District</strong>, where virtually the entire Illinois Democratic establishment (<a href="https://www.sj-r.com/story/news/2021/11/22/illinois-senator-dick-durbin-endorses-nikki-budzinski-congress/8712126002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Dick Durbin</a>, <a href="https://herald-review.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/duckworth-endorses-budzinski-for-central-illinois-congressional-seat/article_50f6a51b-f4f4-56c7-a4cc-3410d83e21c8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Tammy Duckworth</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CheriBustos/status/1437426199677046788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Cheri Bustos</a>) has lined up behind former Biden administration staffer Nikki Budzinski. Her sole competitor, financial advisor David Palmer, has raised a respectable amount of money (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL13146/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$208,300</a>), but it’s still nowhere near Budzinski’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2IL13153/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.7 million</a> haul.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A moderate pragmatist who <a href="https://www.illinoistimes.com/springfield/an-old-school-candidate-in-a-new-district/Content?oid=15089904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earns bipartisan praise</a>, Budzinski should be a strong candidate for Democrats in their quest to flip this downstate seat from Republican control. It was radically redrawn to favor Democrats (spurring incumbent Republican Rep. Rodney Davis to seek reelection elsewhere), but with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> of D+7, it still has the potential to be competitive in a Republican-leaning midterm.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Illinois’s most hotly contested House seat this fall will likely be the <strong>17th District</strong>, a D+4 open seat in rapidly reddening northwestern Illinois. And some of the six candidates running in the Democratic primary, like Army veteran and Rockford Alderman Jonathan Logemann, have <a href="https://www.wcbu.org/local-news/2022-05-04/meet-the-six-democrats-who-hope-to-keep-il-17-blue-in-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicitly run on the argument</a> that they are the most electable in the general election. Others, though — namely former state Rep. Litesa Wallace, who is endorsed by Our Revolution and Indivisible — haven’t been afraid to embrace progressive platform planks like the <a href="https://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/elections/illinois-17th-congressional-district-has-many-candidates-to-choose-from-for-june-primary-election/article_fb758b30-82f4-50dc-ae43-f6356408bb2c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green New Deal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Ind_Dtwn_Chi/status/1532173675088297985?s=20&amp;t=EFwJfGDN5WZZn5_02qLTKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-payer health care</a>. Former television meteorologist Eric Sorensen has also prioritized climate change in his campaign and has argued for the need for more “climate communicators” in Congress. Both Wallace, a Black woman, and Sorensen, who would be Illinois’s first openly gay congressman, would also add to the diversity of the House if elected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ShgMzcPdr2OTGv4RZdSckQpfwBvIHrFU/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> of the primary — an internal survey from Wallace’s campaign — showed Wallace and Sorensen at the head of a fractured field, with 22 percent and 19 percent respectively. However, there are a couple reasons to give the edge to Sorensen here. First, of course, internal polls are often biased in favor of their sponsor. But second, that poll is almost two months old at this point, and Sorensen has had the <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/IL/17/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advantage</a>. He has raised ($450,665) and spent ($311,032) more than any other Democrat, and 314 Action — a group dedicated to electing more scientists to Congress — has also spent <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=IL17&amp;spec=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$615,160</a> on Sorensen’s behalf.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> Governor, lieutenant governor</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>9 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New York was originally supposed to have a lot more primaries today, but its U.S. House primaries were <a href="https://www.news10.com/news/ny-capitol-news/kathy-hochul/new-york-congressional-primary-officially-moves-to-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rescheduled for Aug. 23</a> after a court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> the state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first pass</a> at a congressional map, a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorks-proposed-congressional-map-is-heavily-biased-toward-democrats-will-it-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong partisan gerrymander</a> drawn by Democratic legislators. (A <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/court_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new map</a> was drawn by a neutral expert in late May, but one month wasn’t enough time to organize and pull off a smooth election.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But statewide primaries remained a go for the original primary date of June 28, and at the top of the ballot is the Democratic primary for <strong>governor</strong>. When former Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/andrew-cuomo-had-nowhere-to-go-but-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned</a> last August amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment, his lieutenant, Kathy Hochul, became the <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/kathy-hochul-sworn-in-as-new-yorks-first-female-governor/article_439e4336-043f-11ec-a3d2-d31f16f3cf93.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first female governor of New York</a> — but multiple other ambitious New York politicians started eyeing the job, too. In October, Attorney General Letitia James <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/nyregion/letitia-james-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced she was running</a>; in November, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-jumaane-williams-runs-for-governor-20211116-bvcitztgkjf2lejccxtypk6xde-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams</a> and <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/suozzi-new-york-governor-hochul-james-e03790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Tom Suozzi</a> declared their own campaigns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Hochul moved quickly to solidify her position. Her campaign claimed to have raised <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/hochul-campaign-fundraising-e94529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10 million</a> in her first three months in office, and she landed plum endorsements from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/nyregion/kathy-hochul-emilys-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMILY’s List</a> and the <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2021/10/04/kathy-hochul-democratic-endorsement-chairman/5992444001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chair of the New York State Democratic Party</a>. Trailing in the polls, James made the fateful decision in December to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/nyregion/letitia-james-drops-out-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop out of the race</a>, relieving Hochul of her strongest rival but also potentially consolidating her opposition.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/final-ish-map-congressional-districts-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-85543675</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">On paper, Williams had a lot to gain from James’s withdrawal. Both are progressives (although Williams is more of an <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/personality/2020/08/jumaane-williams-was-made-for-this-moment/175755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activist outsider</a> while James has <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/James-explains-Cuomo-backing-distance-from-13175392.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played nice with the party establishment</a>), while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/nyregion/tom-suozzi-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hochul and Suozzi are moderates</a>. Without James in the race, Williams is also the only candidate left who hails from vote-rich New York City, which cast 58 percent of the vote in the 2018 Democratic primary for governor. (Upstate New York,<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this calculation, I am defining Upstate New York as anything north of the Bronx. Feel free to email me about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/04/18/heres-where-new-yorkers-think-upstate-new-york-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;how wrong this is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a> where the Buffalo-born Hochul is expected to perform well, cast 33 percent, while Suozzi’s base of Long Island cast 10 percent.) Finally, Williams, who would be New York’s first elected Black governor, is also the primary’s only nonwhite candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/nyregion/jumaane-williams-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t come together for Williams</a>, who has openly contemplated dropping out, too, amid his wife’s cancer diagnosis, a sparse campaign schedule and virtually empty campaign coffers. For his entire campaign, he has raised only <a href="https://publicreporting.elections.ny.gov/CandidateCommitteeDisclosure/CandidateCommitteeDisclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$520,859</a> — a paltry sum in a state as expensive as New York. (By contrast, Hochul had raised $33.2 million as of June 13.) For his part, Suozzi had raised $9.8 million as of June 13, but he hasn’t attracted any <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/06/endorsements-democratic-candidates-new-york-governor/186770/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile endorsers</a> that would help him distinguish himself from Hochul. The <a href="https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=08947348-55ff-42bc-8c05-3dd427d2e9b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest poll</a>, conducted June 15-20 for WHEC-TV and WNYT-TV by SurveyUSA, gave Suozzi 18 percent and Williams 11 percent. But Hochul was still way ahead of them both, with 54 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, the real drama in New York may be in the <strong>lieutenant governor</strong> primary. Although the three candidates are each aligned with one of the three gubernatorial candidates, New York voters choose their party’s governor and lieutenant governor nominees in <a href="https://nlga.us/research/methods-of-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate primaries</a>, and then they run as a ticket in the general election. This has the potential to create an awkward situation not only in the fall campaign, but for the next four years in Albany.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Former Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin, whom Hochul tapped to replace herself after becoming governor, started off as the presumed front-runner — but just two months ago, he was <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/breaking-new-york-lt-gov-brian-benjamin-resigns-after-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested on bribery charges and resigned from office</a>. Consequently, Hochul <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/Hochul-appoints-Delgado-as-lieutenant-governor-17144037.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed then-Rep. Antonio Delgado</a> to be her new number two, but the legislature had to change the law in order to allow him to take Benjamin’s place on the ballot. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Delgado has <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2022/05/26/ana-maria-archila-picks-up-new-endorsements--while-antonio-delgado-strives-for-momentum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to play catch-up</a> to progressive activist Ana María Archila (who is aligned with Williams) and former Deputy Brooklyn Borough President Diana Reyna (who is aligned with Suozzi). While Delgado <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/06/07/how-candidates-for-governor-and-lieutenant-governor-are-raising-and-spending-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the most money</a> (including $2 million transferred from his congressional campaign account), it is not the same overwhelming advantage that Hochul has, and Archila has tried to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/20/delgado-new-york-lt-gov-race-hochul-00040340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broaden her appeal beyond just Williams supporters</a>. She has held more campaign events and <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/06/endorsements-2022-democratic-primary-lieutenant-governor/365733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned more endorsements</a> than Delgado, including some (like Rep. Nydia Velázquez) who have endorsed Hochul. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/06/aoc-endorses-ana-mara-archila-for-lieutenant-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thrown her weight behind Archila</a>, which she hasn’t done for Williams. (For her part, Reyna has barely campaigned apart from Suozzi, so her fate seems tied to his.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite a glut of gubernatorial polls, there is no public polling of the lieutenant governor’s race, so Delgado could still very well win this based on the strength of Hochul’s coattails. But if not, Archila has pledged to be a more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/19/nyregion/archila-delgado-lieutenant-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proactive and disagreeable deputy</a> than Hochul would like, holding her feet to the fire from the left or even taking official actions that Hochul might disagree with. No matter who wins, though, he or she will stand out in a different way: Delgado, Archila and Reyna would all be the first Hispanic person elected to statewide office in New York.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its past rulings that granted a constitutional right to an abortion. While five conservatives on the Court supported overturning Roe, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a concurring opinion that he favored upholding the Mississippi law without fully overturning the 49-year precedent. The three liberals on the Supreme Court issued a rare three-justice-authored dissent.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are only a handful of Supreme Court rulings that most Americans can name. The decisions that become a shorthand in our collective vocabulary mark the beginning and end of political eras, the moments when something fundamental changes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brown v. Board of Education. Roe v. Wade. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And now, Dobbs v. Jackson.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For most of the past 50 years, Roe v. Wade was the ruling that was too big to fail. People seemed to believe it would last forever — even in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary. As recently as last fall, when the Supreme Court allowed the state of Texas to implement a law that directly contradicted Roe, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-the-first-time-in-years-democrats-are-more-concerned-about-abortion-than-republicans-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans still thought the ruling was safe</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was very much not. In the Dobbs opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that Roe must be overturned because it amounted to an “abuse of judicial authority.” Along with four other conservatives who joined his opinion, he explained that the Constitution simply doesn’t protect abortion. Roe conferred a right that never existed. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roe was the most famous ruling from an era when rights were being given — to the accused, to racial or ethnic minorities, to women. If I had to guess, I’d say that Dobbs will be the most famous ruling from an era when rights are being taken away. Americans — particularly white Americans — aren’t used to seeing rights vanish overnight. And that’s what makes Dobbs different than the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-categorized-hundreds-of-abortion-restrictions-heres-why-the-anti-abortion-movement-is-escalating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow erosion of abortion rights</a> that I’ve been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-abortion-law-is-unprecedented-but-the-supreme-court-isnt-treating-it-that-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting on</a> for <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-really-hard-to-measure-the-effects-of-abortion-restrictions-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost a decade</a>. Those laws were easy to ignore. This ruling won’t be. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/overturning-roe-means-abortion-access-us-fivethirtyeight-85676655</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Dobbs marks the end of one political era and the beginning of another. The fight to overturn Roe helped define the last 40 years of American politics. Now, the fight over how far Dobbs’s mandate should stretch may define the next 40 years. Soon, many Americans will have to decide, perhaps for the first time in their lives, how they actually feel about legal abortion. And how much they care that abortion rights were given, and then taken away.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/san.diego/facts/abortion/1980.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1980 Republican Party platform</a> promised to “work for the appointment of judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.” Politicians aren’t known for following up on their promises. But the GOP kept that one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the country came down from the high of the 1960s, abortion was a potent symbol of how the rebellious, uninhibited mood of the decade had curdled. Conservative politicians and strategists <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Fk6xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=the+traditional+family+concept+of+husband+as+breadwinner+and+wife+as+homemaker,%27+restrict+motherhood+to+%27the+very+few+months+in+which+a+woman+is+pregnant+and+nursing+her+baby,%27+and+embed+%27the+first+anti-family+amendment+in+the+Constitution.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w7iLOLFGuR&amp;sig=ACfU3U0JqhlywSTygBCtim_RmRwvBaL7Qw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid1or3psT4AhXKEFkFHS5tD8wQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20traditional%20family%20concept%20of%20husband%20as%20breadwinner%20and%20wife%20as%20homemaker%2C'%20restrict%20motherhood%20to%20'the%20very%20few%20months%20in%20which%20a%20woman%20is%20pregnant%20and%20nursing%20her%20baby%2C'%20and%20embed%20'the%20first%20anti-family%20amendment%20in%20the%20Constitution.&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered the rise of legal abortion</a> as an example of the <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pat-robertson-feminist-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feminist movement’s callousness</a>. It was an emblem of sex without consequences, love without marriage, women without children. Evangelical leaders, seizing on an issue that used to be the domain of Catholic Democrats, struck an apocalyptic tone. In 1979, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRc0Szq_uWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one Christian activist</a> took thousands of baby dolls and scattered them over the bed of the Dead Sea. As his camera panned over the dolls, he solemnly described how an abortion is performed. It was, he said, the slaughter of the innocent; the abandonment of morality and decency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southern white voters</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/religion-politics-evangelicals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evangelical Christians</a> shifted their loyalty to the Republican Party, people started to develop opinions on abortion that tracked with their new political allegiances. In the mid-1970s, it was pretty much impossible to distinguish Republicans from Democrats based solely on abortion. Fifteen years later, they were starting to be separated by an all-too-familiar partisan gulf.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The anti-abortion movement succeeded by politicizing the issue everywhere they could — in the courts, in state legislatures and in American society more broadly. Republican strategists and politicians worked to elevate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/us/conservative-legal-movement-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new generation of judges</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-abortion-debate-isnt-as-partisan-as-politicians-make-it-seem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawmakers</a> who believed Roe was wrong. At first, they tried to work within the confines of public opinion, passing laws that seemed innocuous, even protective — requiring <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2134696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waiting periods</a>, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/1995/03/state-actions-reproductive-health-issues-1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counseling</a>, <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.76.4.397" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parental consent</a>. Fear of a backlash was heavy in the air. In 1992, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roe-almost-overturned-in-92/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court teetered</a> on the brink of overturning Roe, but even the court’s Republican appointees were afraid of what it would unleash. They cobbled together a compromise opinion that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-overturned-roe-wade-30-years-ago-82276286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upheld the right to an abortion</a> but allowed for stricter regulation of it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That decision was viewed as a betrayal, and a turning point. From then on, <a href="https://nypost.com/2005/10/28/bye-bye-miers-as-bid-ends-93-pro-abortion-speech-last-straw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-abortion advocates insisted</a> that all future Republican presidents nominate justices <a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/01/24/5081976/judging-samuel-alito-on-abortion-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who wouldn’t falter</a> when the fate of Roe was in their hands. And as time passed, politicians also became more willing to barrel past what most Americans thought was acceptable. In 2013, when <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61 percent of Americans</a> thought abortion should generally be legal in the first three months of pregnancy, Republican legislators in Arkansas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/us/arkansas-adopts-restrictive-abortion-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a law</a> that banned abortion after 12 weeks, which was <a href="https://casetext.com/case/edwards-v-beck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned by the courts</a>. At the time, it felt like a doomed act of hubris. But in retrospect, it was a sign of how powerful anti-abortion activists had become — and where they were going. Their efforts were incremental, but over time, they added up. The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/first-time-ever-us-states-enacted-more-100-abortion-restrictions-single-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracked hundreds of anti-abortion laws</a> that were passed between 2011 and today. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the years since I started covering abortion, I’ve had moments where it’s felt like we were all living through some kind of bizarre political experiment. A solid majority of Americans have supported legal abortion in <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least some circumstances for decades</a>. Support for abortion stayed steady even as abortion access <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/how-perfect-storm-missouri-dwindled-abortion-access-down-virtually-zero-n1011991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was dwindling</a> in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-24/abortion-clinics-are-closing-at-a-record-pace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large swaths of the country</a>. But that support didn’t translate into widespread political backlash, even when states passed more and more laws that fell well outside the mainstream. Exceptions to abortion bans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/health/abortion-bans-rape-incest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in cases of rape or incest</a> — which are popular <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americas-abortion-quandary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even with some conservatives</a> — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/22/725634053/anti-abortion-rights-groups-push-gop-to-rethink-rape-and-incest-exceptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are no longer present</a> in many of the latest restrictions. Last fall, Texas <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned abortion</a> after around six weeks of pregnancy. The law — the most restrictive in the country at that point — went into effect, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/abortion-rights-advocates-will-march-across-us-protest-restrictive-laws-2021-10-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were a couple of weeks of protests</a>, and then … nothing.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-99614324-1024.jpg" alt="Pro-choice demonstrators stand in front of the Supreme Court in 2002" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-99614324-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-99614324-1024.jpg?w=1024 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-99614324-1024.jpg?w=2048 2x"><figcaption>Abortion rights are generally popular in the U.S., but activists have struggled to convince Americans to base their vote on that support. <p>Tom Williams / Roll Call / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Most Americans were able to keep living their lives as if nothing was happening in part because abortion isn’t an experience that affects everyone. Sure, nearly <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abortion-common-experience-us-women-despite-dramatic-declines-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in four women</a> will have an abortion in her lifetime, but those women <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-abortion-has-changed-since-1973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t evenly dispersed</a> across different walks of life. And the difficulty involved in getting an abortion <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/abortion-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">varies wildly depending on all kinds of factors</a> — geography, wealth, insurance coverage, age. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But part of the problem for the abortion-rights movement is that it never quite convinced Americans to connect the dots between legal abortion and the many other ways that women’s lives have been transformed in the decades since the 1960s, and Roe. Abortion might still be controversial, but many of the other social changes it intersected with — sex outside marriage, having a baby outside of marriage, divorce, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/us/declining-birthrate-motherhood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women delaying having children</a>, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/267737/record-high-women-prefer-working-homemaking.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mothers working outside the home</a> — <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/351020/changing-one-gender-sharply-contentious-moral-issue.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have become normal, even expected</a>. Opposition to abortion is still tied up with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-dividing-line-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for traditional gender roles</a>. But I’m not sure how many Americans actually connect abortion rights with their own personal choices and relationships.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Is legal abortion necessary to help women lead the lives they want? It’s a question more Americans may have to ask themselves. Researchers can point you to studies suggesting that access to legal abortion <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w6034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowered child poverty</a>; kept women from <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting married as teenagers</a>; <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3512913#:~:text=The%20increase%20in%20wage%20rates,both%20intensive%20and%20extensive%20margins." target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised women’s wages</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12122-004-1028-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased women’s participation in the labor force</a>; <a href="https://iwpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/B377_Abortion-Access-Fact-Sheet_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it more likely</a> for them to finish college; and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3913899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced maternal mortality</a>. But those trends are easier to spot in big data sets than in individual people’s lives. Would your friend have gotten her degree if only she’d had an abortion? Could your sister have gotten that big raise without one? Causal pathways aren’t easy to tease out in everyday life and they’re shaped as much by our beliefs and post hoc justifications as anything else.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the oral argument last December, lawyers for Mississippi argued that abortion simply isn’t necessary anymore. But that seems like a misreading of the country’s mood. Most Americans just want a status quo where abortion isn’t something you have to think about unless you need one. For many people I’ve spoken with over the years — on the campaign trail, at parties, even at family dinners — the issue feels exhausting, abstract and even a little lurid. They bring it up and then change the subject with a shrug. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that doesn’t mean they think abortion is unnecessary. Instead, the idea of a country without the right to abortion is for many Americans more like a political phantasm — something candidates use to motivate voters, not something that can actually become real.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Except of course, it’s about to be.</p>

Wade. All three of the justices he appointed voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. <p>NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>The Beginning</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">While campaigning in 2016, former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said that he’d appoint</a> justices who would <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/supreme-court-abortion-case-tests-trump-pledge-to-overturn-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn Roe v. Wade “automatically.”</a> I was one of the many journalists and legal experts who chalked this up to a typical Trump overpromise. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trumps-supreme-court-could-overturn-roe-v-wade-without-overturning-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Days after the 2016 election</a>, I tried to sort out what Trump’s election would mean for abortion rights. The Supreme Court is (or was) a measured, sedate branch of government. Could Trump really appoint enough justices who were willing to overturn a decades-old precedent in one fell swoop? It seemed much likelier that Roe would be hollowed out over years or decades, until it collapsed under its own weight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It might not have been automatic, but the court certainly wasn’t patient. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-amy-coney-barrett-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less than two years</a> after Trump appointed his third justice, Roe is gone. And the court’s decision is just the beginning. Dobbs will set in motion a swift and dramatic response. Within a month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/07/us/abortion-access-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tens of millions of reproductive-age women</a> will be living in a state where abortion is illegal. </p>

And it’s true that for better or worse, a veil is being lifted. We’re not heading for another 10 years of the slow removal of abortion access — we’re about to see what happens when half the country takes away a right many people took for granted.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court wrote that the issue of abortion belongs with the states. “This Court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on,” Alito wrote. Now, it's set the battle lines for a conflict that seems likely to escalate. In states controlled by anti-abortion lawmakers, the question may soon be whether a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-fetal-personhood-emerged-as-the-next-stage-of-the-abortion-wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fetus</a>, an embryo or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/06/01/136850622/abortion-foes-push-to-redefine-personhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fertilized egg</a> has the same rights as a person. That will have effects everywhere – in courtrooms, hospitals, even the U.S. <a href="https://personhood.org/2019/06/03/pre-born-children-personhood-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">census</a>. Murder could soon <a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/11/21/246534132/personhood-in-the-womb-a-constitutional-question" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mean a different thing</a> on opposite sides of state lines. Medical practice could change, since abortion care, although siloed in politics, is actually bound up with <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/understanding-pregnancy-loss-in-the-context-of-abortion-restrictions-and-fetal-harm-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many other kinds of health care</a>. The meaning of parenthood could be altered, along with all the legal structures that scaffold it. A Georgia law passed in 2019 <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/55445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires child support payments for fetuses</a>. So can a fetus <a href="https://lawreview.wlulaw.wlu.edu/if-a-fetus-is-a-person-it-should-get-child-support-due-process-and-citizenship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inherit money</a>? Can it <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1334&amp;context=caselrev&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;referer=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own land</a>?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It will take a while, but these changes could insert themselves into people’s lives in ways that appear entirely separate from abortion. But it seems inevitable that people who are carrying wanted pregnancies will feel the effects of these restrictions too. People who use drugs during pregnancy <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/substance-use-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can already be prosecuted</a> or reported in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755304?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp%3Butm_medium=referral&amp;amp%3Butm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp%3Butm_term=111319" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many states</a>. If a fetus is considered a person, the stakes for everything a pregnant person does will be much higher. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’ve been thinking recently about when I arrived at a hospital in southern Indiana to give birth to my daughter last year. As I changed into my delivery gown, a nurse asked me for a urine sample. I asked her why, and she acknowledged that they were going to test it for drugs. When I protested — with the righteous, incoherent anger that only a woman who is five centimeters dilated can muster — they told me that if I refused to consent to the test, they’d act as if it was positive. That, they said, could mean calling in a social worker, someone who would evaluate whether I was capable of parenting my child. The nurse looked into my face with anxiety. “Do you have something to hide?” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I buckled, and consented to the test. What else could I do? I was unnerved by the prospect that my behavior was already being watched, with the assumption that I might be harming my unborn child. After Dobbs, the surveillance that pregnant people already experience could spiral in ways that are hard to predict and control. Already, a pregnant person drinking a cocktail in public risks moral judgment. In the future, it could invite a <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/maternity-drug-policies-by-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very different kind of scrutiny</a>. In fact, some poor and Black women <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hast.791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are already living in this reality</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, abortion could soon be less restricted in some blue states than it ever has been. Democratic lawmakers in states like California are trying to create “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/11/blue-states-abortion-safe-havens-00031526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">havens” for abortion access</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/abortion-california-gavin-newsom-funding-low-income" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even setting up state funds</a> to pay for the procedure. Some companies, too, <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/06/04/companies-that-cover-employee-travel-expenses-for-abortion-care-face-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are offering to reimburse workers</a> who have to travel more than 100 miles for an abortion, laying the groundwork for a new standoff between corporations and GOP legislators.</p>

States are already trying to reach across each other’s borders, to make it <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2022/03/24/inside-missouris-push-to-ban-out-of-state-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/30/connecticut-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easier</a> to travel for abortion. If Republicans win back the White House and a large enough congressional majority in 2024, a national abortion ban <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/mitch-mcconnell-acknowledges-a-national-abortion-ban-is-possible-if-roe-is-overturned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be a possibility</a>. It’s unlikely that anyone on either side of the abortion debate will be content to let the states have the last word.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These changes are so fundamental that they feel like they might have the power to shake something in the country loose, to jolt us out of our political rut. We’re at a point where partisan allegiances and grudges shape everything around us, even <a href="https://pcl.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj22066/files/media/file/iyengar-degruyter-partisanship.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most personal aspects</a> of who we are — our religion, our friends. But the country is about to change in palpable, unpredictable ways. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/limiting-abortion-access-hurts-women-financially-roe-v-wade-rcna27291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hundreds of thousands of people</a> will carry pregnancies to term that they might otherwise have ended. Abortion bans could lead to unexpected consequences — for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/birth-control-banned-roe-v-wade-overturned-legal-experts-warn-rcna28253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birth control</a>, for <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/05/23/how-abortion-bans-might-affect-ivf-00034409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fertility treatments</a>, for <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/crosshairs-on-roe-v-wade-could-usher-demise-of-other-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other rights</a> that seem completely unrelated. If the end of abortion rights — and everything that comes after — doesn’t unsettle our political order, I’m not sure what can.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if Americans do chafe under the policies that are coming, this decision won’t be easy to undo. Abortion rights aren’t the only ones that have come under attack. Thanks to the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/effects-shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court</a> and <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-december-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican legislators</a>, it’s much <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/voting-restrictions-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harder to vote</a> in many states than it was a decade ago. Those states, not coincidentally, are the ones where abortion bans will be the most stringent, and their lawmakers’ grasp on power will be hard to dislodge. There are only a handful of states where this November’s elections will actually have an impact on whether abortion stays legal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a part of me that also wonders if most Americans will be too tired to tune in. Over the past few years, politics has wrung all of us dry. It’s a spectator sport, where we root for our own team’s victory from a safe distance. Maybe abortion will ossify further into one more line dividing us from them and them from us — not so different from the many other partisan feuds that have come to structure our lives.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That, as much as anything, is Roe’s legacy, and the post-Dobbs reality. For decades, Americans ceded the fight over abortion to the loudest, most extreme voices and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to pretend it wasn’t happening</a>. Today, the anti-abortion side won. Now, even though they really don’t want to, Americans have to decide how much abortion matters to them. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court just <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturned</a> one of the most famous and controversial rulings in modern history. A five-justice majority of Republican appointees ruled that Roe v. Wade and a following case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, were wrongly decided. It’s a political earthquake — one that will reverberate for months and years to come, reshaping American lives in ways that are easy and not so easy to predict.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, according to the Supreme Court, there is no constitutional right to abortion. Over the protests of Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted to uphold Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban but not to overturn Roe, the status quo of the past 49 years is gone. (The three liberal justices dissented in full.) That shift will cause an immediate change in many Americans’ lives. As of 11 a.m. Eastern on Friday, abortion is already almost completely illegal in at least four states. By the end of July, it will be almost completely illegal in at least another nine. And the fight over how far abortion rights should stretch or shrink will flare up in many states, surely shaping some of this year’s most important midterm races. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/overturning-roe-means-abortion-access-us-fivethirtyeight-85676655</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">We will have plenty of coverage of the aftershocks in the coming days, and our colleagues at ABC News have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/supreme-court-abortion/?id=85396940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already begun</a> their round-the-clock coverage. But before we focus on the aftermath of the decision, it’s worth dwelling on the decision itself. Friday’s ruling is a manifestation of the devotion to constitutional history that the court’s conservatives have become known for, and it’s packed with hints about what could be in store for the future of abortion and other legal precedents.</p>



<h2><strong>What the ruling said</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">At its heart, Roe v. Wade was about how much states could restrict abortion. In that ruling, states were prohibited from banning abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy and their ability to regulate abortion was limited during the second trimester. That structure changed with Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a Supreme Court case decided in 1992, which replaced the trimester framework with a single dividing line: fetal viability. Even with that change, Americans had a constitutional right to abortion up to a certain point in pregnancy for almost 50 years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito, a Republican appointee, explained that this right simply never existed. “Abortion presents a profound moral question,” he wrote. “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion.” Roe, he wrote, wasn’t simply wrong — it was so wrong as to amount to an “abuse of judicial authority.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This week’s ruling — officially known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health — relied heavily on a historical view of abortion rights. Alito argued that approach is crucial for understanding why abortion couldn’t be constitutionally protected. “Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law,” he wrote. “Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/02/alitos-anti-roe-argument-wrong-00036174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some historians have argued</a> that Alito’s view of this history — which was also laid out in a draft opinion that leaked in early May — isn’t complete. But it’s worth emphasizing because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-supreme-courts-gun-ruling-means-for-gun-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another major opinion released yesterday</a>, overturning a concealed-carry law in New York, also relies heavily on history. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alito acknowledged that a major precedent was being overturned, but he argued that it had to be done because the justices who decided Casey actually made a mistake by relying too heavily on precedent. The court is not required to uphold a previous ruling simply because it’s already on the books, he wrote. In fact, “the Constitution and the rule of law demand” that the question of abortion be returned to the states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ruling is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely to be unpopular</a>. Alito addressed that too: “We cannot exceed the scope of our authority under the Constitution, and we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public’s reaction to our work.” That was another place, he argued, where the justices who decided Casey got it wrong. In that ruling, the majority explicitly noted that overturning Roe would be politically seismic and could undermine the court’s authority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, Alito and the other four justices who signed onto his opinion are risking just that.</p>

<h2><strong>What the ruling means for the future</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most Supreme Court decisions rule on the case at hand while also dropping hints about how the Supreme Court might rule on the same topic in the future. This one is no different. In his majority opinion, Alito included several caveats about what the ruling in Dobbs could mean for other precedents that relied on the same judicial framework as Roe. But concurring opinions by Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh suggest that there could be some disagreement among the conservative justices about what should happen next.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kavanaugh, for his part, took pains to stress what the opinion <em>didn’t</em> say. The Constitution, he wrote, is “neutral” on the issue of abortion. Roe was a mistake, he said, because it took the power to decide whether abortion should be legal from the democratically elected branches of government. But that doesn’t mean it’s illegal everywhere, either. “The Court’s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States,” he wrote. He added that just as the court doesn’t have the authority to say that abortion is a constitutional right, it also doesn’t have the power to “declare a constitutional prohibition of abortion.” Kavanaugh also signaled how he, at least, is thinking about other legal questions that could come up in Dobbs’s wake, including whether states can bar their residents from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion. (His view: No, under the constitutional right to interstate travel.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kavanaugh is clearly trying to head off concerns that the court will outlaw abortion, but in Thomas’s concurring opinion, he signaled that he would like to use the ruling in Dobbs as an opportunity to reconsider other constitutional rights. “In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” he wrote, referring to rulings that, respectively established constitutional rights to contraception; to engage in intimate, consensual sexual conduct; and to same-sex marriage. This could persuade advocates to bring cases challenging those precedents in the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alito, for his part, clearly wanted to head off speculation about what would happen to these precedents, which the three liberal dissenters warned could now be in danger. The court’s other conservative justices are not necessarily champing at the bit to reconsider these precedents. But the question is in the air — and seems likely to come up again in the future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roberts, for his part, did not want to overturn Roe. In his concurring opinion, he bemoaned the broad scope of the court’s new abortion ruling. He agreed with the decision to uphold Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks, but he questioned why it was necessary to go further. The viability line established in Casey was “misguided,” he said, but he also argued that his conservative colleagues were violating the principle of judicial restraint by overturning Roe and Casey entirely. “The Court’s decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a serious jolt to the legal system — regardless of how you view those cases,” he wrote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Roberts was essentially asking his conservative colleagues to slow their roll. The liberal justices, writing in dissent, warned that the swift action in Dobbs will have serious consequences. The decision, they wrote, “says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The fact that the chief justice couldn’t convince the other Republican appointees to slow down is its own signal about where the court is going. Once the most high-profile precedent in two generations has been overturned, what might the conservative bloc be interested in changing next?</p>
