<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108487673512460517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Former President Donald Trump</a> thinks the House select committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol shouldn’t be investigating the attack, but instead investigating the claims of voter fraud that spurred the attack. But Trump must not be watching the hearings, because they <em>are</em> about those claims. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, the hearings are less about the specific acts committed on that day, and more about the disinformation campaign Trump waged before and after the 2020 election. This campaign told millions of Americans a lie, convinced them it was true and <a href="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.insider.com/all-the-us-capitol-pro-trump-riot-arrests-charges-names-2021-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired hundreds to attempt to violently disrupt</a> the country’s democratic process. The hearings have shown how Trump continued to promote the “Big Lie” even as his advisers told him it was nonsense, dozens of court cases attempting to prove fraud were dismissed, and investigators failed to find any evidence of fraud. The hearings have centered on the systemic rot of Trump’s denialism, and how that culminated in the Jan. 6 attack. The focus of the hearings is twofold: the disease of misinformation, not just the symptoms of its malignancy, and how that disease, when left unchecked, can devolve into a violently destructive force. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Monday, the committee used recorded and live testimony from people in Trump’s inner circle to demonstrate that the claims of election fraud being raised by Trump and his supporters were investigated and that they repeatedly turned out to be bunk. Taped testimony from Bill Stepien, Trump’s campaign manager for 2020 and former Trump Attorney General Bill Barr, as well as live testimony from Benjamin Ginsberg, a Republican election lawyer and BJay Pak, a former Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Georgia, told stories of various claims being chased down to no avail. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stepien recalled a claim, for example, that noncitizens had cast illegal ballots in Arizona. “And with the margins being as close as they were, as previously described, that could potentially matter,” Stepien said. So he asked Trump campaign attorney Alex Cannon to look into it. “I recall that the response to that, the reality of that, was not illegal citizens voting in the election, I think it was like overseas voters voting in the election. So obviously, people who were eligible to vote.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/half-gop-primary-winners-big-lie-fivethirtyeight-85234905</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Another example was covered in Barr’s testimony — a claim that more mail-in ballots were returned in Pennsylvania than were sent out. This claim was promoted by Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who is now the Republican nominee for governor in the state. Mastriano <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMastriano/status/1332398733401591808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted in November 2020</a> that the state mailed out 1.8 million ballots yet received 2.6 million mail-in votes back. But that’s not true: Mastriano was comparing the number of mail-in ballots sent out for the <em>primary</em> election to the number returned in the general election. In fact, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9787630390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3 million Pennsylvania voters</a> requested mail-in ballots for the general.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These allegations were investigated by the Justice Department as well as by Trump’s campaign team, according to testimony, and were repeatedly proven false. But those bringing this information to the then-president encountered the same problem that fact-checkers have since the election: With so many false claims of fraud, every time one was disproved, a stack of hundreds of other false claims remained.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/meet-nevada-gop-candidates-support-trumps-big-lie-85370871</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">“There was an avalanche of all these allegations of fraud that built up over a number of days,” Barr said in recorded testimony. “And it was like playing Whac-A-Mole, because something would come out one day and then the next day it would be another issue.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During Thursday’s hearing, the focus was on another inaccurate claim of Trump’s, that former Vice President Mike Pence could and should act to prevent the certification of the election results. Though the hearing at times turned into a dissection of constitutional language, the committee revealed that many of Trump’s legal advisers — excluding John Eastman, who concocted the Pence plan originally — had determined long before Jan. 6 that Pence could not actually stop the certification, and they made that clear to the president. Yet Trump continued to publicly suggest that Pence ought to act and that, if he didn’t, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump was “going to be very disappointed” in Pence.</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The committee tried to make the case that the continued insistence from Trump and his team that Pence had the power and responsibility to stop the vote made Pence a target: It shared video from the attack of rioters calling Pence a “traitor” who had “betrayed the United States,” and saying he “deserves to burn.” They punctuated this with never-before-seen images of Pence in the secure underground location where the secret service had escorted him after the mob breached the Capitol building. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/17-primary-candidates-2020-election-stolen-fivethirtyeight-84760506</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">As the hearings move forward through the rest of the information the committee has found, lies will almost certainly continue to be a focus. The attack was the manifestation of the underlying disease of misinformation, and the hearings help demonstrate how sick the nation has become.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans have spent over 150 years arguing about what kind of history we should teach to our children. In “<a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/99348/schoolbook_nation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schoolbook Nation</a>,” a book that examines the history of conflicts over American curricula, historian Joseph Moreau noted that a variety of Americans have worried about the sky falling if the “wrong” versions of history were taught in our schools. Americans, as Moreau documented, were concerned about this in the 1870s, again in the 1920s and, <a href="https://time.com/6075193/critical-race-theory-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we’ve seen recently</a>, they are <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/07/10/americas-history-wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still concerned today</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One present source of tension is the question of whether and how we should teach children about racism, as well as other less rosy aspects of the nation’s history. Politicians, parents and other influential actors have strong and divided views about this. One side assumes that teaching a more critical version of history would be beneficial to our children and thus argue for <a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/internships/internship-readings/freire-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding more lessons</a> critical of American history to curricula; the other side assumes that such lessons would be harmful and therefore argue that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/us/texas-critical-race-theory-ban-books.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical content should be banned</a> from the classroom.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, though, raises an important empirical question: What actually happens when we teach students critical lessons about American history? Or, put another way, what happens when American children learn about racism?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Social scientists have studied this question for years and found that, overall, there is a lot to be gained from schools teaching students about more challenging aspects of American history. For instance, in one <a href="https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-communication-research-methods/i5632.xml#:~:text=Field%20experiments%20are%20studies%20using,context%20of%20the%20natural%20environment." target="_blank" rel="noopener">field experiment</a> conducted in high schools across the Chicago metropolitan area, University of Chicago political scientist Matthew Nelsen <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-019-09573-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomly assigned nearly 700 high schoolers to read different versions of history textbook segments</a> and then measured what effect they had on students from different racial backgrounds. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/critical-race-theory-part-culture-war-84678918</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Some students were assigned to read excerpts adapted from a widely-circulated history book that presents a relatively typical retelling of American history. Other students were assigned to read excerpts from a more critical history book that foregrounded “marginalized groups, systemic injustice and grassroots political action.” What happened to the students that read these different versions of history?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First and foremost, Nelsen found that, compared to students who read the more traditional history text, students of all racial backgrounds benefitted from reading the more critical text. Latino and Black youth, for instance, reported a greater willingness to participate in acts of political engagement and were also more willing to express their views on a variety of issues. In another work, Nelsen also found that white students <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971457?tab=permissions&amp;scroll=top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported a greater appreciation</a> for the contributions that Black, Latino and Asian Americans have made to American society.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Political scientists are not the only ones finding results like this. Nelsen’s findings are consistent with a larger body of research conducted by a team of psychologists from Northwestern University, the University of Georgia and the University of Vermont. In their <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent review of the literature on this topic</a>, psychologist Sylvia Perry and her colleagues noted that teaching children about racism can actually increase the empathy they have for members of other groups, as well as their concerns about systemic racism. They point to studies showing, for example, that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17988315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when white children learn about racism</a> they are more likely to value racial fairness and show more positive attitudes and empathy toward Black people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard not to look at these results and think — great! — if only our schools taught more critical histories of the U.S., it could improve how different racial groups interact with each other. But that’s not what’s happened in the last few years. In fact, there is currently an active push to restrict how race and racism are taught in schools: Between January 2021 and April 2022, almost 200 bills were introduced across the U.S. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-anti-critical-race-theory-bills-are-taking-aim-at-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to ban the teaching of critical perspectives</a> on the history of the United States.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given the benefits of teaching a more critical version of American history, one might wonder why there is such active resistance to it. But perhaps, unsurprisingly, the answer to that lies within the very same findings I already presented. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/23727322211033000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summarize the research</a> I’ve cited is that when American children are taught more challenging lessons about history, young people of color are inspired to become civically and politically engaged, and young white people gain greater appreciation for their fellow citizens of color. According to Columbia University psychologists Ariel Mosley and Larisa Heiphetz, <a href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-7v4r-3059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there may be an expansion of “moral circles” across different racial groups</a> — that is, young people from different walks of life could end up feeling greater moral obligations to work together and help one another and, as such, become less tolerant of the social systems that maintain and reinforce inequality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you believe in the virtues of a multiracial democracy, then the thought of a diverse coalition of young people coming together to help one another and push for the expansion of rights and greater equity and justice in society might be heartwarming. But if you have a different set of beliefs, ones that are more oriented toward <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3207711/Sidanius_SocialDominanceOrientation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social dominance</a> or a preference for hierarchy and inequality, then findings like the ones I’ve described might be the very kind of evidence that terrifies you.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/education-todays-wedge-issue-fivethirtyeight-83795725</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Consider that in a recent <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13684302211030009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longitudinal study that followed over 2,600 white Americans</a> over three years, New York University and University of Massachusetts Amherst psychologists Eric Knowles, Linda Tropp and Mao Mogami found that compared to white Democrats, white Republicans believed more strongly that minority groups would collude against white people, which could threaten their standing in society if white people did not band together to defend their ingroup interests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, these concerns about which racial groups might hold power in society are not new. Nelsen, the political scientist I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2021.1971457?tab=permissions&amp;scroll=top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in a recent paper</a> that they have long been at the heart of debates about what history schools should teach. White Americans, for instance, have worried for some time now that teaching more critical history in our schools — lessons about racism and other forms of oppression — might cause the nation to lose some of its traditions, and could even lead to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“reverse discrimination” against white Americans</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, one reason why so many white Americans, especially white Republicans, might be concerned about the effects of teaching children about racism — and are actively trying to ban such lessons from schools — is a fear about what this type of education might mean for their own power in society. Teaching about racism could lead to greater cross-race coalition building and the expansion of rights and opportunities for racial minorities to participate in key decision-making systems, but that idea is interpreted by some Americans as an existential threat.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the fear that’s lurking beneath the surface of debates about how to teach our nation’s history. Both sides of the debate seem to have beliefs that are aligned with the evidence: They believe, for instance, that teaching critical lessons about our nation’s history might change power dynamics in the U.S. For some, this is a good thing and something they want children to be taught. But for others, such lessons evoke a sense that they are, to use the language of University of Pennsylvania political communication scientist Diana Mutz, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1718155115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under siege by engines of change</a>. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This is the first entry in a series tracking what it’s like to open an all-trimester abortion clinic in the U.S. as abortion rights are being curtailed.</em></p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Late last year, Dr. Diane Horvath and Morgan Nuzzo decided they wanted to take the plunge and start their own business. They looked for funding from traditional and not-so-traditional sources, figured out creative ways to cut costs and hired lawyers to help them navigate the world of business leases, bank loans and incorporation documents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a journey familiar to entrepreneurs all over the country — but unlike Horvath and Nuzzo, those entrepreneurs aren’t opening an <a href="https://www.partnersinabortioncare.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-trimester abortion clinic</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s an unsettling time to be an abortion provider in America. At some point in the next few weeks, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could overturn Roe v. Wade</a>, the 1973 opinion that established a constitutional right to abortion, sending the issue back to the states. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/06/13-states-have-abortion-trigger-bans-heres-what-happens-when-roe-overturned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thirteen states</a> would promptly ban the procedure, and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another dozen</a> could heavily restrict it. If that happens, abortion providers in the states where abortion remains legal would suddenly face a <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/txpep/files/2022/03/TxPEP-out-of-state-SB8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surge of out-of-state patients</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One state that’s likely to see an influx is Maryland, which is where Horvath and Nuzzo are opening their clinic, Partners in Abortion Care. In a country where abortion providers are increasingly on the defensive, both Horvath and Nuzzo are curiously upbeat. “The one thing that’s moving us along and making it so we’re not despairing is that we’re working toward getting this clinic open,” Horvath said. “We all want to burn shit down and light it on fire but we’re going to build something instead.” </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/supreme-court-overturned-roe-wade-30-years-ago-82276286</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But can they build it fast enough given the Supreme Court’s impending decision? By the time I met Horvath and Nuzzo, in April, they had been trying to get their clinic off the ground for five months. They had qualified for a business loan that they estimated would cover about a fifth of their costs, but they were still waiting to hear back from foundations that said they were committed to helping expand abortion access. In desperation, they set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/expand-abortion-access-in-maryland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoFundMe page</a>, which ended up being a major source of funding: In just over two months, they raised more than $260,000. “I never thought I’d have to crowdfund an abortion clinic,” Horvath said. </p>

Choy / PARTNERS IN ABORTION CARE</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">When we spoke a few weeks later, Nuzzo told me she had a lead on a procedure chair she had found on Facebook Marketplace. “I’ll put it in our storage facility next to the ultrasound machine we bought on Craigslist,” she said. This sounds a little weird, Nuzzo was quick to add, but she said the equipment worked fine and they needed to make progress. “Why not just wait for our money to roll in and buy everything new? Well, we can’t if we want to open in the fall.”</p>



<hr><p data-paragraph="main">Opening a small business is never easy, but getting an abortion clinic off the ground comes with a special set of hurdles — particularly a clinic that offers abortions later in pregnancy. Even when timing and funding aren’t an issue, something as simple as <a href="https://news.syr.edu/blog/2022/05/10/architecture-expert-and-researcher-of-abortion-clinics-on-the-future-of-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding a location</a> can be incredibly difficult. Many landlords don’t want to rent to abortion providers, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-03/how-zoning-law-is-used-against-abortion-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local zoning laws</a> sometimes restrict where abortion clinics can operate. Other businesses might also object to being located in the same shopping plaza as a facility that’s a magnet for protesters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because of these challenges, it’s relatively rare for a new provider not affiliated with Planned Parenthood or another existing clinic to find its footing. According to Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College who maintains a database of abortion providers who publicly advertise their services, 356 providers opened or reopened between January 1, 2013, and June 1, 2022, while 405 clinics closed, reclosed or stopped providing abortions.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some clinics have opened and closed multiple times since 2013, which means they may be counted more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> About 58 percent of the newly opened or reopened clinics are connected to Planned Parenthood, and many others are part of established clinic chains. The impending fall of Roe has not changed this trend. Per Myers, as of June 1, only 10 clinics had opened since January, and just three more (including Partners in Abortion Care) were planning to open in the fall. Meanwhile, 20 clinics had closed or reclosed in the first five months of the year.</p>

A certified nurse-midwife, Nuzzo is something of an anomaly in her field. Maryland recently became one of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/17/states-expand-abortions-flood-of-patients-00032815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of states</a> allowing certain health-care workers who aren’t medical doctors, like registered nurses and nurse-midwives, to provide both medication and procedural abortions, but it’s still uncommon for midwives to specialize in abortion. “The only reason I’ve been trained [to do abortions] is because I just kept hanging around and being like, ‘Can I try? Can I try? Do you think I could do this?’” Nuzzo said. Horvath, for her part, comes from a more traditional background and has been an outspoken advocate for abortion rights. In 2016, after the hospital she worked for tried to stop her from talking publicly about the abortions she had performed, she filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/doctor-warned-to-be-silent-on-abortion-files-civil-rights-complaint.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal civil rights complaint</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those kinds of barriers won’t exist at Partners in Abortion Care. Despite considerable pressure from potential funders, Horvath and Nuzzo decided not to incorporate as a nonprofit, so they are free to engage in political advocacy, something they plan to continue doing. “I remember when Trump said, ‘Oh, they’re ripping babies out of the womb at 39 weeks for abortion,’ blah, blah, blah, I got asked about it in a bunch of interviews,” Horvath said. “I was working for a nonprofit advocacy organization at the time, and the wording we landed on was something like, ‘Statements like that don’t represent medical reality.’ And I was like, ‘What we should be saying is, this is a fucking lie.’” (What Trump described <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/28/fact-checking-trumps-comments-democrats-late-term-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does not happen</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To find a space for their clinic, Horvath and Nuzzo worked with an investor who agreed to purchase a facility for them to rent in College Park, Maryland. That gave them the security of knowing they didn’t have to raise money to buy their own space, as their landlord was supportive of the clinic. But the clock was ticking. They had signed a lease, but by early June, when Roe seemed likely to be overturned any day, they still didn’t have the keys to the facility — which meant they couldn’t buy equipment or hire staff.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Getting into the space to start renovations was another barrier. After months of fruitless meetings with potential funders, they got a $300,000 grant from a small foundation, so between that and the GoFundMe money, Horvath and Nuzzo could finally afford to start paying themselves a salary three months before the clinic was slated to open. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even that timeline — which is speedy by the standards of starting any other business — wasn’t as swift as Horvath and Nuzzo had hoped. Ideally, it would have been better to open in June, before the Supreme Court’s ruling. Now, by the time Partners in Abortion Care does open, the landscape of abortion access could be completely different. And the number of people needing the services of an all-trimester abortion clinic will probably be higher.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Horvath told me about a third-trimester abortion she had performed with Nuzzo’s help. “I remember taking care of a very young girl who was like, stunned, the whole time,” Horvath said. The patient was confused because at that stage of pregnancy, an abortion involves a labor induction, which can hurt a lot. “She kept saying, ‘Why am I in all this pain?’” Later, when the girl was in recovery, Horvath turned to her and asked what she was most looking forward to when she got home. “And she goes, ‘I kind of just want to go back to being a kid again,’” Horvath said. “I had to go into my office and I just started sobbing. And I was like, ‘I will never be able to do anything else. Because this is where I need to be.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In some sense, that’s why Horvath and Nuzzo are so optimistic: At a moment of crisis, they have a job to do. I talked to Nuzzo one Friday afternoon in early June, when the Supreme Court’s decision could come out any day. “I feel very happy right now,” she said. “Roe might fall on Monday, but OK: We finally have money. Enough to open, I think. This is the moment, and we’re here. So I feel good about that.”</p>]]></description>

<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/elena-mejia-lutz/">Elena Mejía</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/">Alex Samuels</a></p>
<p>One consequence of former President Donald Trump’s “Big Lie,” or the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen, is that many states have changed voting laws in their states, making it harder to cast a ballot. In total, we found in our analysis of data from The Brennan Center for Justice, the Voting Rights Lab, the National Conference of State Legislatures and FiveThirtyEight’s own database that since the 2020 election, 24 states have passed 56 new laws that restrict voting, in some cases affecting nearly every step of the process.</p>
<p>Trump’s “Big Lie” fueled a vast amount of voting restrictionsThe number of steps in the voting process targeted by restrictive voting laws passed since 2020, sized by the number of restrictions affecting each stepINININNYNYNYNHNHNHIAIAIANDNDNDVAVAVANCNCNCGAGAGAALALALKYKYKYMSMSMSFLFLFLARARARLALALAOKOKOKKSKSKSTXTXTXAZAZAZNENENENVNVNVUTUTUTWYWYWYIDIDIDMTMTMTMEMEMEMAMAMARIRIRICTCTCTVTVTVTNJNJNJDEDEDEMDMDMDPAPAPAMIMIMIOHOHOHWVWVWVSCSCSCWIWIWIILILILMOMOMOMNMNMNSDSDSDCOCOCONMNMNMCACACAORORORWAWAWATNTNTNHIHIHIAKAKAK</p>
<p>The number of restrictions signed into law in 2021 was unprecedented. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-may-2021">Brennan Center for Justice</a>, the total number of restrictions shatters the previous record-high year, which was 2011, when 14 states enacted 19 laws by October of that year. In other words, depending on where you live, how you cast your ballot this year could be very different. That’s why here at FiveThirtyEight, we’re going to walk you through the new voting restrictions in each state and how they might affect you at each step of the voting process.</p>
<p>REGISTER TO VOTE</p>
<p>The first step in the voting process is registering to vote. Since the 2020 election, 17 states have taken steps to increase the frequency of voter roll purges, which could remove eligible voters from the registration list, often with little notice, and require voters to reregister or cast a provisional ballot when they arrive at their polling place. This is the case in Iowa, where voters are marked as inactive if they didn’t vote in the last general election and if they haven’t registered again or reported a change to voter registration. Other states, like Montana, also took steps to make registration harder by <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2022/05/17/montana-court-overturns-voting-rights-injunction/">ending Election Day registration</a>. In total, there are 29 new laws in place that target voter registration.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-18-states-with-all-mail-elections.aspx">some states</a> conduct elections mostly or entirely by mail, other states rely on more of a mix of in-person and absentee voting. In 2020, though, given the pandemic, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/">absentee voting</a>, especially with mail-in ballots, was really popular. In fact, it helped <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/">clinch President Biden’s victory in 2020</a>. But as a result, a number of states have passed laws that restrict people’s ability to vote by mail. For instance, GOP-led states like Georgia, Texas and Iowa now prohibit mailing absentee ballot applications to voters who haven’t requested one. In total, there are 14 new laws in place that make it harder to apply for an mail-in ballot.</p>

<p>Some states have also tweaked existing deadlines for when absentee ballots need to be returned, giving voters less time to fill out their forms and return them to the appropriate election officials. In Arkansas, for instance, absentee ballots must now be received the Friday before Election Day (the deadline was previously the day before the election). Other states, like Kentucky and Texas, have restricted or criminalized the practice of returning absentee ballots on behalf of someone else, a practice sometimes referred to as “ballot harvesting.” In total, there are 14 new laws in place that have made returning an absentee ballot more difficult.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes to early voting is new restrictions on when voters can actually cast their ballots. Some states passed laws limiting the number of days people could vote early in person. In Kentucky, for instance, county clerks could offer early in-person voting in 2020 as many as 12 days out from the election, but now it’s limited to just the Thursday, Friday and Saturday before an election. Additionally, a handful of states now have new or more stringent identification requirements for those who want to vote early. In total, there are 14 new laws in place that make early voting more challenging.</p>

<p>But not every voter can cast his or her ballot early. Instead, many vote in-person on Election Day. And there are three major ways states targeted Election Day voting post-2020: by introducing stricter voter ID laws, placing additional restrictions on polling places and limiting the accessibility of voting. In Texas, for instance, voting from cars or curbside voting is now banned for people without a disability, which eliminates a pandemic-era change that allowed <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/02/harris-county-drive-thru-locations-closed/">thousands of voters</a> to cast their ballots in one of the state’s most populous counties. Additionally, any person assisting a Texan voting in person must fill out new paperwork disclosing their relationship to the voter. In total, there are 14 new laws in place that introduce hurdles to voting in-person on Election Day.</p>
<p>BALLOT VERIFICATION</p>
<p>Casting a ballot doesn’t necessarily mark the end of the voting process. In some states, there are extra steps that take place after voting in order to verify that the person who cast a ballot is the intended voter, and that, too, has gotten more difficult after 2020. Officials, for instance, may reject ballots that do not meet certain verification requirements as is the case in Indiana, where a new law mandates that county election boards, or the absentee board members in the office of the circuit court clerk, compare the signature of the voter on the absentee ballot with the signature on the absentee-ballot application, the electronic poll book or on file. In total, there are 16 new laws in place that change the ballot verification process. Some states — though not all — do allow voters to fix mistakes on their ballot via a process known as “ballot curing.” Even the states that allow voters to fix errors have passed laws that make it more difficult to do so, like Nevada, which shortened the length of time in which voters can fix errors on ballots.</p>

<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-high-turnout-in-georgia-doesnt-mean-voting-restrictions-havent-had-an-effect/">As we’ve written before</a>, though, it’s challenging at this point to see whether even the most stringent election laws will have a large-scale effect on turnout or which party wins and where. Rather, it’ll be the effect on everyday citizens that matters most when assessing how voting has gotten harder. We don’t know, for instance, whether a handful of voters or thousands of voters will be deterred — or unable to — cast a ballot in states with these new anti-democratic voting measures in place. On the whole, though, voting in this year’s elections will look different from previous cycles. It’s possible, too, that there are more restrictions on the horizon: As long as belief in the “Big Lie” remains <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/14/more-than-100-gop-primary-winners-back-trumps-false-fraud-claims/">a central component</a> of Republican fealty to Trump, lawmakers will continue to push measures that add additional hurdles for voters as a tool to win elections.</p>
<p>METHODOLOGY</p>
<p>The list of restrictive voting laws was collated using data from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-voting-bills-tracker-2021">The Brennan Center for Justice</a>, the <a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search">Voting Rights Lab</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/datasets">Legiscan</a>. It’s limited to any laws enacted in the 50 states since Jan. 1, 2021, that place new limitations or restrictions on the voting process. We did not include any laws that are simply rolling back voting rights expansions enacted in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All categorizations are based on our readings of the legislative text, and are discretionary.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Republican Mayra Flores won the special election in Texas’s 34th Congressional District on Tuesday, avoiding a runoff and flipping the longtime Democratic seat in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew recaps that race and other notable results from the June 14 primaries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Nevada, which Republicans will face off against incumbent Democrats in the highly competitive state this fall came into focus. Four statewide Republican nominees have at least dabbled in “Big Lie” conspiracy theories, including the nominee for secretary of state, Jim Marchant, who said he wouldn’t have certified the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in South Carolina, Trump’s endorsees against Republican incumbent representatives delivered a split decision. Rep. Tom Rice, one of ten Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, was defeated by Russell Fry. Rep. Nancy Mace, who has been critical of Trump, defeated her challenger Katie Arrington.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Back in March, I <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started off an article</a> with the sentence, “Congressional redistricting — the process of redrawing the nation’s 435 congressional districts to reflect the results of the 2020 census — is not quite finished, but it’s getting darn close.” Clearly, I jinxed it: Since then, the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national redistricting landscape</a> has changed substantially, thanks to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Republican-drawn plan</a> in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-just-cost-democrats-their-big-redistricting-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court-ordered</a> remap of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, it’s taken the 2021-22 redistricting cycle from a clear win for Democrats to something <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-countless-confusing-sometimes-contradictory-takeaways-of-the-2021-22-redistricting-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more ambiguous</a> — perhaps best described as the preservation of a Republican-leaning status quo. And a ruling earlier this month striking down <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana’s congressional map</a> is yet another reminder that the 2021-22 redistricting cycle <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34324865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ain’t over till it’s over</a> — and, in fact, very likely won’t be over until well after 2022. That said, the map below is <em>probably</em> the one that will get used in this year’s congressional elections (with Louisiana pending, of course).<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, that’s also what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/baseballot/status/1532462996399718402?s=20&amp;amp;t=PLAj9dL_UNbziQfTkmdzsQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;I said&lt;/a&gt; before Louisiana’s map was struck down. However, there’s something special about Louisiana: It &lt;a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Primary_elections_in_Louisiana" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;doesn’t hold a traditional primary&lt;/a&gt;, so unlike every other state, it doesn’t need to use a new congressional map before the November election.&lt;/p&gt;

Assuming Louisiana’s congressional map is reinstated upon appeal,<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A likely outcome given the conservative nature of the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/08/30/under-trump-5th-circuit-becoming-even-more-conservative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-conservative-supermajority-is-just-beginning-to-flex-its-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, the two courts above the one that struck down Louisiana’s map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> the 2022 House map will feature 208 congressional districts with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> of R+5 or redder, compared with 187 districts that have a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+5 or bluer. Throw in the highly competitive seats, and 225 districts would be more Republican than the country as a whole, while 210 would be more Democratic. In other words, if the national House popular vote were perfectly tied, Republicans would theoretically win 225 seats and Democrats would win 210 (ignoring, for now, other factors like candidate quality).<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Louisiana’s old map is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; reinstated and the legislature draws a new map that has two predominantly Black seats — as ordered by the lower court — you can add one seat to Democrats’ totals in this paragraph and subtract one seat from Republicans’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By this measure, however, Democrats are actually in a slightly better position than they were before, having added a handful of Democratic-leaning seats. Under the <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/partisan-lean/fivethirtyeight_partisan_lean_DISTRICTS.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old congressional lines</a> (those used in the 2020 election), there were 208 congressional districts with partisan leans of R+5 or redder and 181 with partisan leans of D+5 or bluer. Counting swing seats, 230 seats were redder than the nation as a whole, while 205 seats were bluer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, by other measures, the new map is better for Republicans. First, the “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-tipping-point-states-favor-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tipping-point</a>” congressional seat — i.e., the majority-making 218th bluest and 218th reddest seat in the House — is slightly more Republican-leaning. Under the old lines, the tipping-point seat had a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+2.3; under the new ones, the tipping-point seat will have a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+2.5 (again, assuming Louisiana’s map is reinstated on appeal).<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if Louisiana’s map is not reinstated and the legislature draws a new one with two predominantly Black seats, the tipping-point seat would go back to having a partisan lean of R+2.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the short term (i.e., in this year’s midterms), Republicans are also more likely to pick up seats from redistricting. Remember that all the numbers above merely reflect each seat’s underlying partisanship; they don’t account for which party currently holds each seat. And when we do that, we see that more Democratic-held seats have been turned red this redistricting cycle than Republican-held seats have been turned blue. By my calculations, Republicans can expect a net gain of roughly three or four seats this November due to the effects of redistricting alone — not accounting for shifts in voter preference.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the gory math behind that calculation. Between nine and 12 Democratic-held districts have been redrawn to favor Republicans (two in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, three in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one each in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;), while between four and seven Republican-held districts have been redrawn to favor Democrats (two in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one each in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a net gain of five seats for Republicans, give or take. However, Republicans also lost one or two seats on net from &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reapportionment&lt;/a&gt;: Population trends added one red seat in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, but they also subtracted one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the House map’s GOP bias is due to geography (i.e., the Democratic tendency to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/why-democrats-cant-win.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cluster in cities</a>, plus rural areas’ tendency to vote Republican). But a lot is also due to deliberate decisions by partisan mapmakers — namely, Republican lawmakers drawing congressional maps that advantage their own party. In 2014, a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2457468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pair of academics</a> created a metric called the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficiency gap</a>, which attempts to quantify this phenomenon by measuring how efficient a map is at converting votes into seats for a given party. And using this measure, we find that seven of the 11 most biased congressional maps in the country were drawn by Republicans, while only one Democratic-drawn map (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois</a>’s) provides Democrats with more than 1.2 undeserved seats. </p>

However, they didn’t have the chance; those states have vested the power of redistricting in independent or bipartisan commissions. (Though commissions are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-redistricting-commissions-live-up-to-their-promise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not a cure-all for gerrymandering</a> — maps like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a>’s and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a>’s still have notable Democratic biases despite being drawn by commissions.) As it was, though, only five maps this cycle (worth 32 districts) ended up getting enacted unilaterally by Democratic politicians or institutions,<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s worth noting that Democrats could have enacted Maryland’s and Massachusetts’s unilaterally had they wanted to, since they have veto-proof majorities in the legislature in those two states. As it happened, though, Republican Govs. Larry Hogan and Charlie Baker, respectively, agreed to sign their Democratic-drawn maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> while 18 (worth 171 districts) were enacted unilaterally by Republican ones. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s an even bigger disparity than <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we expected at the beginning of the cycle</a>, when we observed that Democrats controlled the redistricting process in eight states worth 75 districts but Republicans controlled the process in 20 states worth 187 districts. That’s because liberal courts cracked down on gerrymandering this cycle and generally enforced fairer congressional maps — even when it hurt the Democratic Party. Most notably, Democrats initially drew maps with galling efficiency gaps in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/final_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/amended_democratic_proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, only to see them get struck down in court. However, courts in Republican-controlled states largely did not return the favor. For example, despite appearing to be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-extreme-bias-of-floridas-new-congressional-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slam-dunk</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal gerrymanders</a> under <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ohios-overturned-congressional-map-shows-how-lawsuits-might-scramble-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established judicial precedent</a>, Republican-drawn maps in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alabama</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio</a> look like they will stand for at least the 2022 election. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The resulting national congressional rat’s nest doesn’t just hurt Democrats; it also hurts the average voter who just wants their vote to matter. As Republicans drew maps to help protect their vulnerable incumbents, they decreased the number of competitive House seats around the country. The number of swing seats has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-swing-districts-dwindle-can-a-divided-house-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining for years</a> due to both gerrymandering and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ending-gerrymandering-wont-fix-what-ails-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple polarization</a>, but this year, we’re on pace for the smallest number of non-safe seats (defined as having partisan leans between D+15 and R+15) in decades. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By our reckoning, the new maps<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than Louisiana’s, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> have six fewer highly competitive seats (partisan leans between D+5 and R+5) than the old ones. The number of competitive Republican districts (partisan leans between R+5 and R+15) has decreased by even more — 13 seats! However, the number of competitive Democratic districts (partisan leans between D+5 and D+15) has increased by 12.</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This reflects the different goals the two parties had in redistricting this year, as can be seen plainly when we break down the seat change by which party enacted the new maps. Having <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2016/07/19/gerrymandering-republicans-redmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the 2011-12 redistricting cycle</a>, Republicans had little left on their redistricting to-do list other than to reinforce Republican-held seats that weren’t as red as they could be. As a result, they drew a whopping 18 fewer swing and light-red seats in exchange for 16 more dark-red ones.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, the number of solidly blue seats decreased by three in states where Democrats unilaterally redistricted. But the number of light-blue seats grew by six. That’s because Democrats’ goal in redistricting wasn’t to draw safer seats for themselves; it was to draw more seats that leaned Democratic, whether by a lot or a little. The way they did this in states like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Mexico</a> was to dismantle solidly blue districts and spread their wealth of Democratic voters out among more districts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, it’s a risky strategy. Democrats could hold several seats they might otherwise have lost — but, in a particularly good election year for Republicans, they could also lose seats that wouldn’t have been in danger under the old maps. But for a party trying to dig its way out from under a Republican-biased House map, it may be worth risking more losses in a worst-case scenario in order to make it possible for the party to win a majority in (more common) neutral scenarios.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Up to this point, I’ve been focusing on the partisan impact of the 2021-22 redistricting cycle. But I’d be remiss not to mention the racial impact too. As part of their efforts to draw the best possible maps for their side, both parties — but mostly Republicans — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neglected to provide full representation to people of color</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sometimes, this took the form of denying seats to racial minorities even when their numbers could support them. For example, Texas’s nonwhite population <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/12/texas-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased by almost 4 million people</a> between the 2010 and 2020 censuses, almost single-handedly earning the state two new congressional districts. But the state did not add any new districts where people of color were the largest racial or ethnic group. Similarly, it is readily possible to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draw two predominantly Black districts in Alabama and Louisiana</a>, but the maps passed by those states’ Republican legislatures contained just one predominantly Black district each. (This is why Louisiana’s map has been found illegal, for now.) The new maps in <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/03/07/federal-suit-challenges-arkansas-congressional-districts-over-racial-gerrymandering-of-2nd-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arkansas</a>, <a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/12/31/lawsuits-claim-georgias-redistricting-maps-ignore-black-population-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-naacp-south-carolina-lawsuits-house-elections-eb3c5825d5c9582b708a3c7ddffd541d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina</a> are also currently subject to lawsuits over racial gerrymandering.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other times, this took the form of actively decreasing the clout of nonwhite voters. This is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify since a racial group does not have to constitute a majority of a district in order for that district to elect that racial group’s preferred candidate. But districts in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina all got whiter to the extent that their ability to consistently elect Black or Hispanic voters’ candidate of choice is now in question. Most egregiously, the predominantly Black congressional district between Tallahassee and Jacksonville — which was <a href="https://mcimaps.com/lets-talk-about-the-florida-5th-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created explicitly to elect</a> Black voters’ candidates of choice and <a href="https://jaxtrib.org/2022/02/22/florida-legislature-unite-against-gov-desantis-redistricting-expert-to-protect-black-jacksonville-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both Democrats and Republicans alike</a> agreed was constitutionally protected — no longer exists under Florida’s new map.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Voting-rights advocates are suing over that maneuver, too, and the case is <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/529274-florida-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-challenge-to-congressional-map-ahead-of-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently pending</a> before a mid-level Florida appeals court. A final decision isn’t expected before the midterms (especially since the losing side would almost certainly appeal to the Florida Supreme Court anyway), but that doesn’t mean the lawsuit will disappear. In fact, it is just one of many lawsuits that could continue to change the face of the national congressional map for years after the “2021-22” redistricting cycle is supposed to be complete.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On that note, we already know that at least one state will have to go through the redistricting process <em>again</em> during 2023-24: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>. The North Carolina Supreme Court struck down the legislature’s first two attempts at drawing a congressional map and eventually imposed its own, but the map is only valid for one election cycle. Several other states could join North Carolina. There’s Florida, of course, where past rulings by the Florida Supreme Court (albeit a less conservative one) suggest that the new map should be struck down as both a racial and partisan gerrymander. This would necessitate a complete redraw ahead of the elections in 2024 — or, if the case really drags on, 2026.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Ohio Supreme Court is also <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/03/ohio-supreme-court-sets-arguments-for-challenges-to-republican-congressional-map-past-start-of-voting-for-may-primary-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently considering</a> the legality of Ohio Republicans’ second attempt at a congressional map, which is not all that different from the one that was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ohios-overturned-congressional-map-shows-how-lawsuits-might-scramble-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down as a partisan gerrymander</a> in January. If they strike it down again, Ohio will have to adopt a new map for the 2024 elections. And regardless, Ohio will have to adopt a new map for 2026 anyway, since this one was not passed with bipartisan support, which is required in Ohio for a map to last the entire decade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also Alabama and Louisiana, whose maps seem destined to be decided by a single U.S. Supreme Court decision next year, as they both hinge on the question of whether the Voting Rights Act requires them each to draw a second Black district. Because this is a federal case, the decision here could also inspire — or force — other states to redraw their maps to include fewer or more minority-opportunity seats, depending on which way the ruling goes.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/gerrymandered-districts-weird-56189221</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">But the case with the biggest potential repercussions is a federal lawsuit brought by Republicans in North Carolina that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-ask-us-supreme-court-curb-state-courts-election-oversight-role-2022-03-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes a radical argument</a>: that only state legislatures, not state courts, have the power to draw new congressional districts. The Supreme Court will <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/moore-v-harper-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decide on Thursday</a> whether to take the case, and if they decide to embrace its argument to the fullest, every congressional map not enacted by a legislature could be invalidated. This would mean not only throwing out court-ordered maps in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, but potentially also commission-drawn maps in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey and Washington. In other words, the 2020s could see a historic amount of mid-decade redistricting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And this underscores the folly of ever declaring redistricting complete; maps are never set in stone. The national congressional map might be “darn close” to final for 2022, but it will continue to evolve in the years after. While it’s tempting to wrap up <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our redistricting coverage</a> with a neat little bow, I’m not going to do that. Redistricting doesn’t work like that. Maps could still change; partisan and racial biases could still get better or worse. This isn’t goodbye; it’s see you later.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">If the U.S. Supreme Court really does overturn Roe v. Wade, abortion would effectively become illegal in 13 states — and heavily restricted in many others — because of trigger laws designed to go into effect either immediately or within weeks. Each of these laws is a little different, but all of them make some kind of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/us/abortion-trigger-laws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exception for the health or life of the mother.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But determining when someone’s health or life is at risk is not always straightforward. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Medical science doesn’t come with tidy boundaries between life and death, emergency and non-emergency. Sometimes it’s not clear if an emergency is life-threatening until it’s too late. Other times, a medical problem could mean losing years of one’s life or struggling with long-term health problems but not necessarily dying today or tomorrow. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’re looking for patients, clinicians and hospital administrators who have had to navigate these kinds of situations. We’re especially interested in talking to people who have had to ask a hospital board to approve an abortion in this kind of case, or who have been on the boards considering such cases. We want to understand how biology and medicine leave patients and the people who care for them in gray areas that can’t be easily legislated. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Political division <a href="https://legacy.voteview.com/political_polarization_2015.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been on the rise</a> for years in the U.S. The gap between the two parties <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/solutions-to-political-polarization-in-america/confronting-asymmetric-polarization/3966003B2517E22BF288796AC4985F34" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only grown more sharply</a> in Congress, while the share of Americans who interact with people from the other party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-and-republicans-should-argue-more-not-less/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has plummeted</a>. Furthermore, many Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/03/04/about-one-fifth-of-democrats-and-republicans-get-political-news-in-a-kind-of-media-bubble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read news or get information</a> from sources that align with their political beliefs, which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-partisans-look-at-the-same-evidence-on-ukraine-and-see-wildly-different-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exacerbates fundamental disagreements</a> about the basic facts of many political problems.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, hatred — specifically, hatred of the other party — increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defines our politics</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard to overstate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how dire the situation is</a> because it’s been this way for a while. It’s something, too, that everyday Americans are feeling — and are worried about. “American citizens are growing more extreme and isolated in their political views,” said a white woman in her mid-30s from Wisconsin who identified as a Democrat. “No one can respect each other’s opinions and try to work together in a peaceful way,” said a Republican Hispanic man from California in his mid-20s. “Individuals and the media hard-sell their own views with no understanding or attempted understanding of other viewpoints,” said an independent Black woman from Texas in her mid-60s.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polarization and extremism ranked third across a list of 20 issues that we asked about in the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a>, which was conducted from May 26 to June 6. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we interviewed the same 2,000 or so Americans from our previous survey, and of the 1,691 adults who responded, 28 percent named “political extremism or polarization” as one of the most important issues facing the country,<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As was the case in the first wave of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country. Sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.9 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> trailing only “inflation or increasing costs” and “crime or gun violence,” the latter of which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/over-40-percent-of-americans-now-rate-gun-violence-as-a-top-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surged in the aftermath</a> of mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans are pretty concerned with political polarization" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cnADC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="607" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Americans typically have not ranked polarization or extremism as a top concern. Historically, concerns around the economy or fear of military conflict have loomed the largest in American minds. But over the past decade, Gallup has seen a larger share of people cite <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/165302/dysfunctional-gov-surpasses-economy-top-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction with the government or poor leadership</a> as the nation’s top issue, reaching <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246800/record-high-name-government-important-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record highs</a> in recent years. This is similar to what we found in our survey, too. Almost 3 in 10 Americans said they were worried about extremism and polarization, which is essentially unchanged from our poll last month.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats were the most likely to name polarization or extremism as a top worry, at 33 percent, but independents and Republicans weren’t too far behind at 28 percent and 23 percent, respectively. This does seem, though, to be an issue that Americans who are more politically engaged care about. For instance, 38 percent of likely voters named it as a top concern, compared with 28 percent overall, which marked the largest gap between likely voters and Americans as a whole on any issue we measured.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How Americans define “polarization” varies. Some spoke of the inability of the two major parties to compromise, while others blamed political leaders or the other party. But overall, regardless of how they identified politically, most Americans blamed elites for America’s divides. Sixty-four percent said they felt political polarization is mostly driven by political and social elites, compared with only 11 percent who thought it had more to do with how ordinary Americans think and behave.<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 25 percent said they didn’t know or skipped the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> “Both political parties have moved way to the outside, and there's no center pole for people to meet at,” said Sandra O’Kay, an elderly woman from Virginia who identified as an independent. “Congress is not making the rules. They're just fighting one another.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when we asked about what specific groups or ideas might be driving polarization, there was also a fair amount of consensus on the four leading contributors: politicians, wealthy donors, social media companies and mainstream media outlets. After that, though, agreement broke down, and there were some stark differences across party lines. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans blame politicians and the media for stoking divisions" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2pDYG/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="481" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The biggest splits by party came over the role of conservative media outlets, religion and religious leaders. Nearly two-thirds of Americans thought conservative media had a “major” or “significant” impact on political division. However, as you can see in the chart above, this was strongly split along party lines. Eighty-one percent of Democrats said this, compared with only 48 percent of Republicans, while independents echoed where Americans fell overall. Democrats were also more likely to say that religion or religious leaders were major drivers of polarization, which probably reflects the fact that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are much more likely to be religiously unaffiliated</a> than Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were also smaller but still noticeable splits over the role racism, capitalism and wealth inequality play in stoking division. For instance, solid majorities of both Democrats and Republicans said that they felt that racism had had a major or significant impact on polarization, with 82 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans answering that way. However, given that Republicans and Democrats <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-still-a-huge-partisan-gap-in-how-americans-see-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view discrimination very differently</a>, they likely answered this way for very different reasons. Meanwhile, Democrats were likelier to blame wealth inequality and capitalism than were Republicans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of this disagreement on what’s driving polarization likely reflects just how far apart the two parties are on a variety of issues; however, even where there are stark disagreements, those differences are often still overstated. We asked respondents in our survey whether they agreed with five statements that we thought were polarizing, and to guess how members of the other party would respond. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the topic of whether abortion should be legal in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, a majority of Democrats and Republicans were on the same side — about 89 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans agreed with this statement. However, their <em>perceptions</em> of each other were starkly different: Democrats thought that a minority (only 30 percent) of Republicans agreed, whereas Republicans correctly thought that a solid majority (68 percent, which is still an underestimate) of Democrats agreed with the statement.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans hold some misperceptions about one another" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qQR4v/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="679" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That said, there were other instances where Democrats and Republicans knew just how divided they were on an issue. For instance, on the topic of what should be taught in middle and high schools, 64 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans said that schools should teach about sexual orientation and gender identity. And respondents from both parties guessed within 2 percentage points of the actual share of the other party that agreed with the statement. We saw a somewhat similar picture regarding whether middle and high schools should teach race and racism in the U.S. Eighty-three percent of Democrats said they should, while Republicans perceived Democratic support at 65 percent; meanwhile, just 29 percent of Republicans agreed, while Democrats thought 19 percent of Republicans were in support.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The disconnect between Democrats and Republicans over race and racism is further exemplified by their vastly different responses to Republican South Carolina Sen. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/29/992063405/president-biden-gops-tim-scott-offer-diverging-views-of-race-in-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Scott’s</a> statement, “America is not a racist country. It's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present.” In our survey, we asked respondents to score eight public statements on whether they represented an extreme or non-extreme viewpoint,<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We defined “extreme” as responses that said the statement was “very” or “somewhat” extreme, and “not extreme” as responses that rated the statement as “not very” or “not at all” extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> and when they were asked to rate Scott’s anonymized quote as “extreme” or “not extreme,” almost three in four Democrats said that it was extreme, as opposed to just 34 percent of Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These partisan differences are in part related to the ethnic diversity of Democrats, as Black and Hispanic Americans account for a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger portion of the Democratic Party</a> than the Republican Party. Tellingly, respondents’ answers also varied by race or ethnicity, with nearly three-quarters of Black Americans and 57 percent of Hispanic Americans finding the statement extreme, compared to 48 percent of white Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Suffice it to say, there are <em>real</em> differences between the two parties, but most Americans (62 percent) still want the U.S. to actively reduce political polarization. Only 9 percent think that the U.S. should let things be.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 percent said that they didn’t know or skipped the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> But as our poll shows time and time again, many Americans don’t think political leaders and elites represent their interests. “I feel like I have to just kind of read up on what people are saying and what people are doing and try to figure out who's the least extreme, who I side with. [To make the U.S. less polarized,] I think [we need] cooperation and collaboration between everybody, politicians and people in general,” said Sara from Alabama. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s evident, too, that polarization is weighing heavily on many Americans, as it’s hard to see a way out of our current partisan gridlock. “I think things have to hit such a dark, grizzly, rock-bottom state,” said Randal Strauss, a 55-year old independent man from Nebraska. “Where people think, hey, something's got to change.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This week’s primaries are a gamble — and not just because many of them are in Nevada. Former President Donald Trump is backing challengers to not one but two incumbent members of Congress, which will once again put the power of his endorsement to the test. Meanwhile, both parties face decisions about how far right or left of center a nominee can be in a swing seat and still stand a chance of winning in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, four states are holding primaries on Tuesday: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina. We aren’t expecting any races in Maine or North Dakota to be competitive, but to make up for it, there’s a special election in Texas that either party could plausibly win. So grab your lucky dice and let’s roll through the important elections this week.</p>

Katie Arrington is one of two primary challengers in South Carolina who has former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. <p>Sean Rayford / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>South Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st and 7th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plenty of Republicans — like South Carolina’s own senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott — have walked the line between criticizing and praising Trump and have managed to stay on his good side, but Rep. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>, has not. Despite working for his 2016 presidential campaign early in the primary season, Mace <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/newsmaker-scs-nancy-mace-speaks-out-about-jan-6-and-her-former-boss-donald-trump/article_0134c7f8-61ce-11ec-8f9a-c317e9d5151b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripped Trump a new one</a> after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, saying that the insurrection had “wiped out” “[e]very accomplishment that Republicans have made over the last four years.” However, she quickly tried to mend those fences with votes against a bipartisan Jan. 6 commission and for ousting anti-Trump Rep. Liz Cheney from House Republican leadership.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump didn’t buy it. In February, he <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-49ynqegxvm1542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> former state Rep. Katie Arrington — a loyalist who shares his false belief that the <a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/local/vote/mace-arrington-meet-in-south-carolina-1st-district-unitedstates-house-representative-debate-politics/101-29a0132a-8f28-4804-a2e5-86456ea8d9e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a> — in the Republican primary against Mace. Notably, too, Arrington has experience taking down incumbents in this coastal, Charleston-area seat: She <a href="https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2018/06/13/trump-backer-arrington-defeats-sanford-in-primary/11985379007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford</a> in the 2018 Republican primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mace looks like a tougher foe, however. First, she outraised Arrington by a whopping <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0SC01394/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2SC01150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$909,447</a>, as of May 25. Second, Mace isn’t as anti-Trump as Sanford, who briefly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/mark-sanford-presidential-bid-trump-069872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran against Trump</a> for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination; she didn’t vote to impeach Trump, for instance. She’s also <a href="https://m.facebook.com/nancyrmace/videos/im-standing-in-front-of-trump-tower-with-a-message-this-morningsc01-lowcountryfi/1054561101770084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Arrington (who lost the general election in 2018) would lose the seat to Democrats in the fall, though redistricting made the 1st District safely Republican (it has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> of R+17), so that isn’t an honest argument. The primary could go either way: The only non-internal poll of the race, conducted May 26-29 by the <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC01-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group</a>, gave Mace 46 percent and Arrington 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>7th District</strong>, though, another anti-Trump Republican looks like he’s in more trouble. Rep. Tom Rice was one of the more anonymous members of the House GOP caucus before Jan. 13, 2021, when he shockingly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-elections-impeachments-south-carolina-7278bdc701aaa2d74d1f46c97a6233e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to impeach Trump</a> for his role in the Jan. 6 riot. (The vote came so far out of left field that some observers initially thought it was an error.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six other Republicans, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/454411952597146/permalink/697460194958986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> <a href="https://www.spencermorrisforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of</a> <a href="https://barbaraarthurforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GarrettBartonSC/status/1473815874561667075?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ardent</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMcBrideUS/status/1409976933601927170?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article259273459.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defenders</a>, filed to run against Rice, and initially the field was <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1504097178700165123?s=20&amp;t=GA4y7JlS1eh2Ch6Jjg-Wxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite muddled</a> — Rice wasn’t polling great, but neither was anyone else. But in February, Trump tapped state Rep. Russell Fry as <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/myrtle-beach/politics/donald-trump-endorses-russell-fry-in-primary-challenge-to-sc-congressman-tom-rice/article_863bba62-8387-11ec-ab26-63ae4d94c45d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his preferred candidate</a>, and Fry shot up in the polls. According to another <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC07-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group poll</a>, also conducted May 26-29, Fry entered the home stretch with 42 percent support to Rice’s 25 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With other candidates like self-funder Ken Richardson still earning a decent share of the vote, however, it looks very possible that no one will win a majority on Tuesday. If that happens, the top two finishers — likely to be Fry and Rice — will head to a runoff on June 28. But given the size of the anti-incumbent vote, Rice is probably cooked either way.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>34th Congressional District </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas’s primaries <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/texas-election-biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were on March 1</a> with its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/11-primaries-to-watch-in-alabama-arkansas-minnesota-and-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runoff elections</a> on May 24, but there’s one more election on our radar in the Lone Star State before this November’s general election: the special election in the <strong>34th District</strong> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/24/filemon-vela-resign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the resignation</a> of Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of Tuesday’s special election will finish Vela’s truncated term, which ends in January. But Republicans in the state are eager to go ahead and flip the 34th District as they attempt to make inroads in South Texas — along with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several other border-area seats</a> in the fall. Republican gains in the 34th might be short-lived, though, because while Tuesday’s election will happen under the previous, more competitive boundaries of the 34th District — which has a partisan lean of D+5 — the November election, which will decide who succeeds Vela for a full term in Congress, will be held under new district boundaries that are much more favorable to Democrats — its boundaries have a partisan lean of D+17. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the Republican side, the biggest name in the four-person field is Mayra Flores, the current GOP nominee for the seat in the November general election. Not only does Flores have the backing of Texas Gov. <a href="https://www.gregabbott.com/governor-greg-abbott-endorses-mayra-flores-for-congressional-district-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Abbott</a>, but she also has the support of the <a href="https://congressionalleadershipfund.org/trailblazers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Leadership Fund</a>, a super PAC close to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There haven’t been many public polls of the race, but a new <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5u8kf9ryfiwrb7i/RRH%20Elections%20TX-34%20Poll%20Release.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RRH Elections/Poll Project USA</a> poll gave Flores a 9-point edge over her nearest opponent, former Cameron County Commissioner Dan Sanchez, a Democrat. According to the survey, Flores led among likely or completed voters with 43 percent support, while Sanchez netted 34 percent. Another internal party poll conducted in late April by <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TX-CD-34_Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnar Research Partners for Flores</a> and the National Republican Congressional Committee similarly gave Flores an edge over Sanchez, 24 percent support to 19 percent. In that survey, Democrat Rene Coronado, a civil service director, came in third, at 9 percent, while Republican Juana Cantu-Cabrera, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Flores’s opponents</a> in the March primary, earned 7 percent. Forty-one percent of voters, however, were still undecided. And as far as outside spending goes, Flores has an edge here, too. She and <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1534518699805261825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her allies</a> have <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1529849232521322503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured hundreds of thousands</a> of dollars and resources into TV ads, and as of May 25, Flores significantly outraised Sanchez. Sanchez does, though, have a little bit more cash on hand (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00811901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$104,017</a>) than Flores (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00768994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100,387</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a historically Democratic seat. Vela <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/V000132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented the district since 2013</a>, and Democratic presidential candidates handily beat Republicans in the district in <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/3/23/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-statewide-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 and 2016</a>. And in 2020, President Biden still won the district by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percentage points</a>. But the Republican offensive has caught Democrats off guard in an area of the state <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have long dominated</a>. Part of the struggle for Democrats here is that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee didn’t get involved in the race <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1533090469504245761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until recently</a>, when it launched a $100,000 ad buy in partnership with Sanchez’s campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It seems as if Democrats’ strategy has been to avoid investing heavily in this race and instead wait until the fall. It’s also worth noting that Sanchez <em>isn’t</em> running to fill Vela’s full term; instead, it’s Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez — who opted to not run in Tuesday’s special election — who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailed through the March 1 primary</a> and will be the party’s nominee against Flores this fall. So, even if Sanchez were to<em> </em>win, he’d hold the seat only until January. National Democrats, meanwhile, have maintained that Gonzalez will easily triumph in November, especially since that race will take place under district lines that are more favorable to Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, though, another possible wrinkle in Tuesday’s race is that the special election could<em> </em>go to a runoff given the presence of Coronado and Cantu-Cabrera, two lesser-known candidates, on the ballot; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the top two vote-getters go head-to-head later this year. Still, Sanchez <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/06/republicans-south-texas-special-election-tx-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has expressed confidence</a> that his party can win the seat outright.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 3rd and 4th congressional districts; governor; attorney general; secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most vulnerable politicians in the country this year, and eight Republicans are running for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> in hopes of replacing her. The front-runner is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who boasts endorsements from both <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/donald-trump-endorses-ex-nevada-ag-adam-laxalt-for-senate-2424479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> and the <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/elections/pac-endorsed-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club for Growth</a>, an anti-government-spending outside group that has a lot of influence in Republican primaries. Laxalt was a co-chair of Trump’s 2020 campaign in Nevada and <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2021/11/08/adam-laxalt-trumpism-and-the-big-lie-a-chronology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a lawsuit</a> two days after the election, falsely alleging that thousands of improper votes had been cast in Nevada. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Army veteran Sam Brown has run a <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/05/10/republican-candidate-sam-brown-nevada-senate-race-primary-election-2022/7374118001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunningly effective grassroots campaign</a> that has contrasted his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/outsider-nevadas-gop-senate-primary-surges-rattling-trumps-pick-rcna31225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsider status</a> with Laxalt’s establishment roots. (Laxalt is the grandson of former Nevada Gov. and Sen. Paul Laxalt.) Brown has also somehow tried to position himself as even Trumpier than Laxalt, too, arguing that Laxalt was <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/in-an-odd-early-morning-debate-brown-says-laxalts-efforts-to-save-trump-were-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not aggressive <em>enough</em></a> in trying to stop alleged voter fraud. As of May 25, Brown has raised more than $2 million from small donors and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2NV00308/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $4 million</a> in total, which he has used to outspend Laxalt on TV and radio ads through June 1. A <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-laxalt-has-a-14-point-lead-over-brown-in-week-before-election-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6-7 poll</a> from OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent still gave Laxalt a 48 percent to 34 percent lead among likely voters, but that represented a tightening of the race since <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-cortez-masto-leads-laxalt-in-senate-race-but-biden-disapproval-foreboding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even more Republicans — 15! — are vying for the right to take on Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak in the race for <strong>governor</strong>. When former Sen. Dean Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dean-heller-launches-bid-for-governor-attempts-political-comeback-three-years-after-senate-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race</a> last year, he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/independent-poll-sisolak-cortez-masto-hold-slim-leads-over-likely-gop-opponents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked like the favorite</a> based on his political experience (he didn’t lose a single election from 1990 until 2018) and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/dean-heller-running-governor-nevada-refuses-say-joe-biden-won-n1279869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born-again Trumpism</a>. But Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-raises-record-4-5-million-in-2021-has-more-cash-than-all-gop-foes-combined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with fundraising</a> and <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/05/gop-ex-u-s-senator-dean-heller-lags-race-nevada-governor/7403033001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to make voters forget his moderate past</a>. By January 2022, a new front-runner <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-sisolak-leads-governor-candidates-lombardo-tops-gop-field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had emerged</a>: Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ironically, Lombardo is not as Trumpist as Heller on issues like <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/immigration-proves-to-be-flashpoint-between-lombardo-other-gop-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and the <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/01/southern-nevada-sheriff-looks-north-first-bid-governors-office/7818738002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election</a> (when asked if it was fair, he said he didn’t have enough information to say), but Trump <a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/2022/04/28/trump-endorses-joe-lombardo-governor-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him anyway</a> in late April, after it became clear he was leading. Despite that vote of confidence, however, Lombardo doesn’t seem to be running away with the nomination. The aforementioned <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-lombardo-maintains-gop-governor-primary-lead-lg-and-sos-races-remain-close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights/Nevada Independent poll</a> gave him just 34 percent, little changed from January. But instead of Heller (who took just 10 percent), his closest competitor was Trump true believer Joey Gilbert, an attorney and former professional boxer who <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/01/06/gubernatorial-hopeful-joey-gilbert-no-regrets-about-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a>. Gilbert received 21 percent support in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also face a choice of whom to nominate in Nevada’s three competitive, Democratic-held U.S. House seats. Thanks to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>, that list now includes the <strong>1st District</strong>, which went from a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+22 to just D+4 in an attempt to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/democrats-gamble-with-their-nevada-gerrymander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shore up the other Democratic seats</a>. Eight Republicans are <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/10/scrum-of-challengers-jockey-to-face-titus-in-nevad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting for the nomination</a>, and without any public polls of the primary, it’s hard to say who’s favored. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One strong contender could be Carolina Serrano, who led the Trump campaign’s Hispanic outreach efforts in Las Vegas in 2020. In addition to her campaign experience, Serrano has raised the most money as of May 25 (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04094/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$568,123</a>) and has Laxalt’s endorsement. But Army veteran Mark Robertson has raised nearly as much (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03153/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$542,621</a>) and has the backing of diehard Arizona conservative Rep. Andy Biggs. Pro-Israel activist David Brog has also raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01298/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$381,728</a>, and former Rep. Cresent Hardy could draw support from those looking for an experienced hand (though he has somehow raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV04059/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9,000</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whoever wins will face Democratic Rep. Dina Titus in November … probably. Titus <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/titus-facing-hardest-race-in-recent-years-to-retain-seat-in-newly-competitive-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces a challenge in the Democratic primary</a> from progressive activist Amy Vilela, who has been endorsed by <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/bernie-sanders-endorses-vilela-in-house-primary-against-incumbent-titus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>. It’s rare, of course, for an incumbent to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose in a primary</a>, but there are a couple reasons to think this could be a sleeper race. First, because of how drastically Nevada’s congressional map was redrawn, only 52 percent of people in the new 1st District are Titus’s current constituents, meaning she may not get the full benefits of incumbency. Also, despite getting outraised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV03036/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01264/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$490,568</a>, Vilela has actually spent more money than Titus ($437,195 to $329,210) as of May 25, suggesting Titus may not be taking the challenge seriously. (That said, it’s possible that Titus has spent a lot more since then.) If Vilela does pull off an upset, though, it could make it more challenging for Democrats to hold this newly competitive seat in the current, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning</a> political environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also have their eye on defeating Democratic Rep. Susie Lee in the <strong>3rd District</strong>, with its partisan lean of only D+2. Attorney April Becker looks like the <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/attorney-leads-in-fundraising-endorsements-in-cd3-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cream of a five-candidate crop</a>: She has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> and has a ton of institutional support from the <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidates/april-becker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Republican Congressional Committee</a>, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Nevada Republican Party. Groups that aim to elect more Republican women to Congress, such as <a href="http://maggieslist.org/candidates/2022-candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie’s List</a> and Rep. Elise Stefanik’s <a href="https://elevate-pac.com/our-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-PAC</a>, are also <a href="https://viewpac.org/who-we-support/#NEVADA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing her</a> to <a href="https://winningforwomen.com/2022-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hilt</a>. However, two men — engineer John Kovacs and Army veteran Noah Malgeri — have also raised a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NV/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respectable sum of money</a> for their campaigns and can’t be counted out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, three candidates are <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/trio-of-republicans-target-horsford-in-4th-district-2577111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking the Republican nomination</a> to take on Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford in the <strong>4th District</strong>, which is now Nevada’s bluest House seat, at D+5. Assemblywoman Annie Black is probably Democrats’ dream opponent; she has <a href="https://anniefornevada.com/anniegrams/the-real-big-lie-is-that-biden-won-fair-and-square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vociferously argued</a> that the 2020 election was stolen, and she <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2021/jan/09/democratic-group-wants-nevada-lawmaker-who-cheered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a> outside the Capitol (but also condemned those who actually broke into the building). However, she has raised only about half as much money as Air Force veteran Sam Peters, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04128/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$360,755</a> versus <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NV04023/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$716,382</a>, respectively. Peters, though, is no moderate; he has said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/us/politics/republican-election-fraud-claims.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have voted to certify</a> the results of the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Republican <strong>Secretary of State</strong> Barbara Cegavske term-limited, Nevadans will also elect a new top election official this year — an extremely important post given Nevada’s status as a key swing state. And most of the candidates in the Republican primary are at least sympathetic to — if not fully convinced by — Trump’s false belief that the <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/09/gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-largely-cling-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That includes the two front-runners, former Assemblyman Jim Marchant and former state Sen. Jesse Haw, who were tied for first place in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CTiQCmW_nxI108fJ9qg6VzVm_pGvctHi/edit#gid=1338850840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> of the race. However, Marchant has been much more assertive about his antidemocratic convictions. After losing a congressional race in 2020, Marchant <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-rejects-marchant-request-for-new-election-in-congressional-race-over-voter-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued for a rerun of the election</a>, claiming he was a victim of fraud. “Your vote hasn’t counted for decades,” he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told voters at a February debate</a>. “You haven’t elected anybody. The people that are in office have been selected. You haven’t had a choice.” Marchant says he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/candidates-say-trump-won-2020now-running-oversee-future-elections-rcna26241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have certified the 2020 election</a> in Nevada if he had been secretary of state at the time, and he wants to ban the use of electronic voting machines, mail voting and early voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Haw, who has been blanketing the state with <a href="https://twitter.com/haw_jesse/status/1519346263031894016?s=20&amp;t=rGq0l2QaQq7Cm2tfa-sbYQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ads</a> thanks to his significant financial advantage over his opponents, has been more evasive. He <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/elections-and-big-lie-come-to-the-fore-in-secretary-of-state-primaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Nevada Independent</a> that the 2020 election “had a lot of shenanigans and potential fraud” but has focused mostly on besmirching Nevada’s liberal election laws, such as a new regulation allowing non-family members to return other people’s absentee ballots.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2022/05/24/nevada-sos-race/#sthash.92Cx5p68.cSjmsZ6M.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only Republican</a> who has publicly acknowledged that President Biden legitimately won the election is Sparks City Councilman Kristopher Dahir, but he took only 3 percent in the poll. The winner of the GOP primary will face attorney Cisco Aguilar, the only Democrat in the running, in November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, two Republicans are also running in hopes of unseating Democratic <strong>Attorney General</strong> Aaron Ford, the state’s chief law-enforcement officer. Former Nevada Cannabis Association President Tisha Black’s campaign is being run by consultants with <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ties to the Republican establishment</a>, but she faces a spirited challenge from conservative activist Sigal Chattah. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Chattah says she decided to run for attorney general because of her belief that Nevada’s COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwwGGjk2XUs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provocative rhetoric</a> on and off the campaign trail has sometimes gotten her in trouble. (Most notably, a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/ag-candidate-in-feud-with-former-ally-says-text-not-racist-leaked-to-damage-her-2528181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text message was leaked</a> in which she said Ford, who is Black, “should be hanging from a [expletive] crane.”) She also says she wants to <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/20/chattah-black-spar-in-republican-ag-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecute women who have abortions</a>, though she has acknowledged that abortion is legally protected in Nevada and that she is obligated to uphold the law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Black and Chattah have also pledged to use the power of their office to prosecute voter fraud, which they believe is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/state-ag-races-litmus-test-gop-election-claims-82706738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more common than it really is</a>. (“Our democracy, I believe, is in question,” Black told the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada Independent</a>.) The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1i21SmRkaavn80r1vqV89tVJcUY5JdO/edit#gid=1473190800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only poll of the primary</a>, conducted back in early May by OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent, found a toss-up race, with the two candidates virtually tied and a plurality of voters undecided.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This week’s primaries are a gamble — and not just because many of them are in Nevada. Former President Donald Trump is backing challengers to not one but two incumbent members of Congress, which will once again put the power of his endorsement to the test. Meanwhile, both parties face decisions about how far right or left of center a nominee can be in a swing seat and still stand a chance of winning in November.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All told, four states are holding primaries on Tuesday: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina. We aren’t expecting any races in Maine or North Dakota to be competitive, but to make up for it, there’s a special election in Texas that either party could plausibly win. So grab your lucky dice and let’s roll through the important elections this week.</p>

Katie Arrington is one of two primary challengers in South Carolina who has former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. <p>Sean Rayford / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>South Carolina</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> 1st and 7th congressional districts</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 7 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Plenty of Republicans — like South Carolina’s own senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott — have walked the line between criticizing and praising Trump and have managed to stay on his good side, but Rep. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina’s <strong>1st Congressional District</strong>, has not. Despite working for his 2016 presidential campaign early in the primary season, Mace <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/newsmaker-scs-nancy-mace-speaks-out-about-jan-6-and-her-former-boss-donald-trump/article_0134c7f8-61ce-11ec-8f9a-c317e9d5151b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripped Trump a new one</a> after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, saying that the insurrection had “wiped out” “[e]very accomplishment that Republicans have made over the last four years.” However, she quickly tried to mend those fences with votes against a bipartisan Jan. 6 commission and for ousting anti-Trump Rep. Liz Cheney from House Republican leadership.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump didn’t buy it. In February, he <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/news-49ynqegxvm1542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> former state Rep. Katie Arrington — a loyalist who shares his false belief that the <a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/local/vote/mace-arrington-meet-in-south-carolina-1st-district-unitedstates-house-representative-debate-politics/101-29a0132a-8f28-4804-a2e5-86456ea8d9e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a> — in the Republican primary against Mace. Notably, too, Arrington has experience taking down incumbents in this coastal, Charleston-area seat: She <a href="https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2018/06/13/trump-backer-arrington-defeats-sanford-in-primary/11985379007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford</a> in the 2018 Republican primary.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Mace looks like a tougher foe, however. First, she outraised Arrington by a whopping <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0SC01394/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.1 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2SC01150/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$909,447</a>, as of May 25. Second, Mace isn’t as anti-Trump as Sanford, who briefly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/mark-sanford-presidential-bid-trump-069872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran against Trump</a> for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination; she didn’t vote to impeach Trump, for instance. She’s also <a href="https://m.facebook.com/nancyrmace/videos/im-standing-in-front-of-trump-tower-with-a-message-this-morningsc01-lowcountryfi/1054561101770084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that Arrington (who lost the general election in 2018) would lose the seat to Democrats in the fall, though redistricting made the 1st District safely Republican (it has a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> of R+17), so that isn’t an honest argument. The primary could go either way: The only non-internal poll of the race, conducted May 26-29 by the <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC01-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group</a>, gave Mace 46 percent and Arrington 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Next door in the <strong>7th District</strong>, though, another anti-Trump Republican looks like he’s in more trouble. Rep. Tom Rice was one of the more anonymous members of the House GOP caucus before Jan. 13, 2021, when he shockingly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-elections-impeachments-south-carolina-7278bdc701aaa2d74d1f46c97a6233e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to impeach Trump</a> for his role in the Jan. 6 riot. (The vote came so far out of left field that some observers initially thought it was an error.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Six other Republicans, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/454411952597146/permalink/697460194958986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> <a href="https://www.spencermorrisforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of</a> <a href="https://barbaraarthurforcongress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GarrettBartonSC/status/1473815874561667075?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ardent</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMcBrideUS/status/1409976933601927170?s=20&amp;t=BrkMwQl3bZd9Mabp7BE0jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article259273459.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defenders</a>, filed to run against Rice, and initially the field was <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1504097178700165123?s=20&amp;t=GA4y7JlS1eh2Ch6Jjg-Wxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite muddled</a> — Rice wasn’t polling great, but neither was anyone else. But in February, Trump tapped state Rep. Russell Fry as <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/myrtle-beach/politics/donald-trump-endorses-russell-fry-in-primary-challenge-to-sc-congressman-tom-rice/article_863bba62-8387-11ec-ab26-63ae4d94c45d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his preferred candidate</a>, and Fry shot up in the polls. According to another <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC07-GOP-Primary-Poll-Report-0601.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trafalgar Group poll</a>, also conducted May 26-29, Fry entered the home stretch with 42 percent support to Rice’s 25 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With other candidates like self-funder Ken Richardson still earning a decent share of the vote, however, it looks very possible that no one will win a majority on Tuesday. If that happens, the top two finishers — likely to be Fry and Rice — will head to a runoff on June 28. But given the size of the anti-incumbent vote, Rice is probably cooked either way.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch: </strong>34th Congressional District </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas’s primaries <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/texas-election-biden-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were on March 1</a> with its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/11-primaries-to-watch-in-alabama-arkansas-minnesota-and-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runoff elections</a> on May 24, but there’s one more election on our radar in the Lone Star State before this November’s general election: the special election in the <strong>34th District</strong> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/24/filemon-vela-resign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the resignation</a> of Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The winner of Tuesday’s special election will finish Vela’s truncated term, which ends in January. But Republicans in the state are eager to go ahead and flip the 34th District as they attempt to make inroads in South Texas — along with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several other border-area seats</a> in the fall. Republican gains in the 34th might be short-lived, though, because while Tuesday’s election will happen under the previous, more competitive boundaries of the 34th District — which has a partisan lean of D+5 — the November election, which will decide who succeeds Vela for a full term in Congress, will be held under new district boundaries that are much more favorable to Democrats — its boundaries have a partisan lean of D+17. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the Republican side, the biggest name in the four-person field is Mayra Flores, the current GOP nominee for the seat in the November general election. Not only does Flores have the backing of Texas Gov. <a href="https://www.gregabbott.com/governor-greg-abbott-endorses-mayra-flores-for-congressional-district-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Abbott</a>, but she also has the support of the <a href="https://congressionalleadershipfund.org/trailblazers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional Leadership Fund</a>, a super PAC close to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There haven’t been many public polls of the race, but a new <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5u8kf9ryfiwrb7i/RRH%20Elections%20TX-34%20Poll%20Release.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RRH Elections/Poll Project USA</a> poll gave Flores a 9-point edge over her nearest opponent, former Cameron County Commissioner Dan Sanchez, a Democrat. According to the survey, Flores led among likely or completed voters with 43 percent support, while Sanchez netted 34 percent. Another internal party poll conducted in late April by <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TX-CD-34_Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnar Research Partners for Flores</a> and the National Republican Congressional Committee similarly gave Flores an edge over Sanchez, 24 percent support to 19 percent. In that survey, Democrat Rene Coronado, a civil service director, came in third, at 9 percent, while Republican Juana Cantu-Cabrera, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of Flores’s opponents</a> in the March primary, earned 7 percent. Forty-one percent of voters, however, were still undecided. And as far as outside spending goes, Flores has an edge here, too. She and <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1534518699805261825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her allies</a> have <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1529849232521322503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured hundreds of thousands</a> of dollars and resources into TV ads, and as of May 25, Flores significantly outraised Sanchez. Sanchez does, though, have a little bit more cash on hand (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00811901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$104,017</a>) than Flores (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00768994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100,387</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a historically Democratic seat. Vela <a href="https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/V000132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represented the district since 2013</a>, and Democratic presidential candidates handily beat Republicans in the district in <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/3/23/1220127/-Daily-Kos-Elections-statewide-election-results-by-congressional-and-legislative-districts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 and 2016</a>. And in 2020, President Biden still won the district by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percentage points</a>. But the Republican offensive has caught Democrats off guard in an area of the state <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/04/joe-biden-texas-border-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have long dominated</a>. Part of the struggle for Democrats here is that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee didn’t get involved in the race <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickSvitek/status/1533090469504245761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until recently</a>, when it launched a $100,000 ad buy in partnership with Sanchez’s campaign. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It seems as if Democrats’ strategy has been to avoid investing heavily in this race and instead wait until the fall. It’s also worth noting that Sanchez <em>isn’t</em> running to fill Vela’s full term; instead, it’s Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez — who opted to not run in Tuesday’s special election — who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/01/us/elections/results-texas-us-house-district-34.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailed through the March 1 primary</a> and will be the party’s nominee against Flores this fall. So, even if Sanchez were to<em> </em>win, he’d hold the seat only until January. National Democrats, meanwhile, have maintained that Gonzalez will easily triumph in November, especially since that race will take place under district lines that are more favorable to Democrats. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, though, another possible wrinkle in Tuesday’s race is that the special election could<em> </em>go to a runoff given the presence of Coronado and Cantu-Cabrera, two lesser-known candidates, on the ballot; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the top two vote-getters go head-to-head later this year. Still, Sanchez <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/06/republicans-south-texas-special-election-tx-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has expressed confidence</a> that his party can win the seat outright.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Races to watch:</strong> U.S. Senate; 1st, 3rd and 4th congressional districts; governor; attorney general; secretary of state</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Polls close:</strong> 10 p.m. Eastern</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most vulnerable politicians in the country this year, and eight Republicans are running for <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> in hopes of replacing her. The front-runner is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who boasts endorsements from both <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/donald-trump-endorses-ex-nevada-ag-adam-laxalt-for-senate-2424479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump</a> and the <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/elections/pac-endorsed-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club for Growth</a>, an anti-government-spending outside group that has a lot of influence in Republican primaries. Laxalt was a co-chair of Trump’s 2020 campaign in Nevada and <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2021/11/08/adam-laxalt-trumpism-and-the-big-lie-a-chronology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a lawsuit</a> two days after the election, falsely alleging that thousands of improper votes had been cast in Nevada. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, Army veteran Sam Brown has run a <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/05/10/republican-candidate-sam-brown-nevada-senate-race-primary-election-2022/7374118001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunningly effective grassroots campaign</a> that has contrasted his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/outsider-nevadas-gop-senate-primary-surges-rattling-trumps-pick-rcna31225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsider status</a> with Laxalt’s establishment roots. (Laxalt is the grandson of former Nevada Gov. and Sen. Paul Laxalt.) Brown has also somehow tried to position himself as even Trumpier than Laxalt, too, arguing that Laxalt was <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/in-an-odd-early-morning-debate-brown-says-laxalts-efforts-to-save-trump-were-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not aggressive <em>enough</em></a> in trying to stop alleged voter fraud. As of May 25, Brown has raised more than $2 million from small donors and <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S2NV00308/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost $4 million</a> in total, which he has used to outspend Laxalt on TV and radio ads through June 1. A <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-laxalt-has-a-14-point-lead-over-brown-in-week-before-election-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6-7 poll</a> from OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent still gave Laxalt a 48 percent to 34 percent lead among likely voters, but that represented a tightening of the race since <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-cortez-masto-leads-laxalt-in-senate-race-but-biden-disapproval-foreboding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even more Republicans — 15! — are vying for the right to take on Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak in the race for <strong>governor</strong>. When former Sen. Dean Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dean-heller-launches-bid-for-governor-attempts-political-comeback-three-years-after-senate-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped into the race</a> last year, he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/independent-poll-sisolak-cortez-masto-hold-slim-leads-over-likely-gop-opponents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked like the favorite</a> based on his political experience (he didn’t lose a single election from 1990 until 2018) and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/dean-heller-running-governor-nevada-refuses-say-joe-biden-won-n1279869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born-again Trumpism</a>. But Heller <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-raises-record-4-5-million-in-2021-has-more-cash-than-all-gop-foes-combined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with fundraising</a> and <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/05/gop-ex-u-s-senator-dean-heller-lags-race-nevada-governor/7403033001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to make voters forget his moderate past</a>. By January 2022, a new front-runner <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-sisolak-leads-governor-candidates-lombardo-tops-gop-field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had emerged</a>: Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ironically, Lombardo is not as Trumpist as Heller on issues like <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/immigration-proves-to-be-flashpoint-between-lombardo-other-gop-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immigration</a> and the <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/01/southern-nevada-sheriff-looks-north-first-bid-governors-office/7818738002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election</a> (when asked if it was fair, he said he didn’t have enough information to say), but Trump <a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/2022/04/28/trump-endorses-joe-lombardo-governor-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed him anyway</a> in late April, after it became clear he was leading. Despite that vote of confidence, however, Lombardo doesn’t seem to be running away with the nomination. The aforementioned <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-lombardo-maintains-gop-governor-primary-lead-lg-and-sos-races-remain-close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OH Predictive Insights/Nevada Independent poll</a> gave him just 34 percent, little changed from January. But instead of Heller (who took just 10 percent), his closest competitor was Trump true believer Joey Gilbert, an attorney and former professional boxer who <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/01/06/gubernatorial-hopeful-joey-gilbert-no-regrets-about-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a>. Gilbert received 21 percent support in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also face a choice of whom to nominate in Nevada’s three competitive, Democratic-held U.S. House seats. Thanks to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting</a>, that list now includes the <strong>1st District</strong>, which went from a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of D+22 to just D+4 in an attempt to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/democrats-gamble-with-their-nevada-gerrymander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shore up the other Democratic seats</a>. Eight Republicans are <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/10/scrum-of-challengers-jockey-to-face-titus-in-nevad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting for the nomination</a>, and without any public polls of the primary, it’s hard to say who’s favored. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One strong contender could be Carolina Serrano, who led the Trump campaign’s Hispanic outreach efforts in Las Vegas in 2020. In addition to her campaign experience, Serrano has raised the most money as of May 25 (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04094/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$568,123</a>) and has Laxalt’s endorsement. But Army veteran Mark Robertson has raised nearly as much (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03153/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$542,621</a>) and has the backing of diehard Arizona conservative Rep. Andy Biggs. Pro-Israel activist David Brog has also raised a respectable <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01298/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$381,728</a>, and former Rep. Cresent Hardy could draw support from those looking for an experienced hand (though he has somehow raised just <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV04059/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9,000</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whoever wins will face Democratic Rep. Dina Titus in November … probably. Titus <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/titus-facing-hardest-race-in-recent-years-to-retain-seat-in-newly-competitive-district" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces a challenge in the Democratic primary</a> from progressive activist Amy Vilela, who has been endorsed by <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/bernie-sanders-endorses-vilela-in-house-primary-against-incumbent-titus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://ourrevolution.com/endorsements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Revolution</a>. It’s rare, of course, for an incumbent to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ed-markey-won-but-its-still-been-a-rough-year-for-incumbents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose in a primary</a>, but there are a couple reasons to think this could be a sleeper race. First, because of how drastically Nevada’s congressional map was redrawn, only 52 percent of people in the new 1st District are Titus’s current constituents, meaning she may not get the full benefits of incumbency. Also, despite getting outraised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8NV03036/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.3 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV01264/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$490,568</a>, Vilela has actually spent more money than Titus ($437,195 to $329,210) as of May 25, suggesting Titus may not be taking the challenge seriously. (That said, it’s possible that Titus has spent a lot more since then.) If Vilela does pull off an upset, though, it could make it more challenging for Democrats to hold this newly competitive seat in the current, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning</a> political environment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans also have their eye on defeating Democratic Rep. Susie Lee in the <strong>3rd District</strong>, with its partisan lean of only D+2. Attorney April Becker looks like the <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/09/attorney-leads-in-fundraising-endorsements-in-cd3-republican-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cream of a five-candidate crop</a>: She has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV03161/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> and has a ton of institutional support from the <a href="https://nrcc.org/candidates/april-becker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Republican Congressional Committee</a>, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Nevada Republican Party. Groups that aim to elect more Republican women to Congress, such as <a href="http://maggieslist.org/candidates/2022-candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maggie’s List</a> and Rep. Elise Stefanik’s <a href="https://elevate-pac.com/our-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-PAC</a>, are also <a href="https://viewpac.org/who-we-support/#NEVADA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing her</a> to <a href="https://winningforwomen.com/2022-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the hilt</a>. However, two men — engineer John Kovacs and Army veteran Noah Malgeri — have also raised a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/NV/03/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respectable sum of money</a> for their campaigns and can’t be counted out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, three candidates are <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/trio-of-republicans-target-horsford-in-4th-district-2577111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking the Republican nomination</a> to take on Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford in the <strong>4th District</strong>, which is now Nevada’s bluest House seat, at D+5. Assemblywoman Annie Black is probably Democrats’ dream opponent; she has <a href="https://anniefornevada.com/anniegrams/the-real-big-lie-is-that-biden-won-fair-and-square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vociferously argued</a> that the 2020 election was stolen, and she <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2021/jan/09/democratic-group-wants-nevada-lawmaker-who-cheered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attended the Jan. 6 riot</a> outside the Capitol (but also condemned those who actually broke into the building). However, she has raised only about half as much money as Air Force veteran Sam Peters, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2NV04128/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$360,755</a> versus <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H0NV04023/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$716,382</a>, respectively. Peters, though, is no moderate; he has said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/us/politics/republican-election-fraud-claims.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have voted to certify</a> the results of the 2020 election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With Republican <strong>Secretary of State</strong> Barbara Cegavske term-limited, Nevadans will also elect a new top election official this year — an extremely important post given Nevada’s status as a key swing state. And most of the candidates in the Republican primary are at least sympathetic to — if not fully convinced by — Trump’s false belief that the <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/jun/09/gop-secretary-of-state-candidates-largely-cling-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 election was stolen</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That includes the two front-runners, former Assemblyman Jim Marchant and former state Sen. Jesse Haw, who were tied for first place in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CTiQCmW_nxI108fJ9qg6VzVm_pGvctHi/edit#gid=1338850840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent poll</a> of the race. However, Marchant has been much more assertive about his antidemocratic convictions. After losing a congressional race in 2020, Marchant <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-rejects-marchant-request-for-new-election-in-congressional-race-over-voter-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued for a rerun of the election</a>, claiming he was a victim of fraud. “Your vote hasn’t counted for decades,” he <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-debates-secretary-of-state-candidates-cast-wildly-different-visions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told voters at a February debate</a>. “You haven’t elected anybody. The people that are in office have been selected. You haven’t had a choice.” Marchant says he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/candidates-say-trump-won-2020now-running-oversee-future-elections-rcna26241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would not have certified the 2020 election</a> in Nevada if he had been secretary of state at the time, and he wants to ban the use of electronic voting machines, mail voting and early voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By contrast, Haw, who has been blanketing the state with <a href="https://twitter.com/haw_jesse/status/1519346263031894016?s=20&amp;t=rGq0l2QaQq7Cm2tfa-sbYQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV ads</a> thanks to his significant financial advantage over his opponents, has been more evasive. He <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/elections-and-big-lie-come-to-the-fore-in-secretary-of-state-primaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Nevada Independent</a> that the 2020 election “had a lot of shenanigans and potential fraud” but has focused mostly on besmirching Nevada’s liberal election laws, such as a new regulation allowing non-family members to return other people’s absentee ballots.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2022/05/24/nevada-sos-race/#sthash.92Cx5p68.cSjmsZ6M.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only Republican</a> who has publicly acknowledged that President Biden legitimately won the election is Sparks City Councilman Kristopher Dahir, but he took only 3 percent in the poll. The winner of the GOP primary will face attorney Cisco Aguilar, the only Democrat in the running, in November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, two Republicans are also running in hopes of unseating Democratic <strong>Attorney General</strong> Aaron Ford, the state’s chief law-enforcement officer. Former Nevada Cannabis Association President Tisha Black’s campaign is being run by consultants with <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ties to the Republican establishment</a>, but she faces a spirited challenge from conservative activist Sigal Chattah. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Chattah says she decided to run for attorney general because of her belief that Nevada’s COVID-19 restrictions were unconstitutional, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwwGGjk2XUs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provocative rhetoric</a> on and off the campaign trail has sometimes gotten her in trouble. (Most notably, a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/ag-candidate-in-feud-with-former-ally-says-text-not-racist-leaked-to-damage-her-2528181/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text message was leaked</a> in which she said Ford, who is Black, “should be hanging from a [expletive] crane.”) She also says she wants to <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/05/20/chattah-black-spar-in-republican-ag-primary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecute women who have abortions</a>, though she has acknowledged that abortion is legally protected in Nevada and that she is obligated to uphold the law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Black and Chattah have also pledged to use the power of their office to prosecute voter fraud, which they believe is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/state-ag-races-litmus-test-gop-election-claims-82706738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more common than it really is</a>. (“Our democracy, I believe, is in question,” Black told the <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-primary-for-nevadas-top-cop-pits-establishment-backed-lawyer-against-conservative-firebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada Independent</a>.) The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1i21SmRkaavn80r1vqV89tVJcUY5JdO/edit#gid=1473190800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only poll of the primary</a>, conducted back in early May by OH Predictive Insights/the Nevada Independent, found a toss-up race, with the two candidates virtually tied and a plurality of voters undecided.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Sunday, 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans in the Senate announced that they had reached an agreement on new gun-safety measures and funding for mental-health services and school security. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew explains how senators made this bipartisan deal and considers whether this unwritten gun-control legislation could be passed by the end of the year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The team also discusses Alaska’s special primary election to replace its longtime U.S. representative, Don Young, who died in March. Former Gov. Sarah Palin is leading so far, but results won’t be certified for about two more weeks, until all the mail-in ballots have been processed and counted. And on Tuesday, four states — Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina — are holding their primary elections, but only Nevada and South Carolina have competitive races; the most interesting race to watch on Tuesday, though, is another special election in Texas, where candidates are vying to succeed Rep. Filemon Vela for the rest of his term in the 34th Congressional District, after he resigned in April. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, FiveThirtyEight’s Kaleigh Rogers and Galen Druke talk about the ongoing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-january-6-committee-hosted-a-hearing-for-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House select committee hearings</a> investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and how the messaging is developing through both emotional testimony and raw footage from the day of the insurrection.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">If the conservative Supreme Court justices were hoping that eliminating abortion protections would make Americans think the country was on their side, they might not be as persuasive as they hope. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/3574x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new preprint</a> from Chelsey Clark and Elizabeth Levy Paluck, researchers at Princeton University, shows that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent leak</a> of a draft Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade made some Americans more likely to think others <em>wanted</em> abortion protections. Perhaps as a result, these Americans also saw the justices as more out of step with mainstream public opinion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clark and Paluck conducted a panel survey of U.S. residents (one that returns to the same group of participants over time) between June 2020 and May 2022, and their study found that the share of panel participants who think that <em>other</em> Americans support legal abortion spiked after the draft opinion became public.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one question in this study, participants were asked, “To what extent do you believe that people in America disagree or agree that a woman should continue to be able to have an abortion legally?” and were allowed to respond “strongly agree,” “agree,” “somewhat agree,” “neutral,” “somewhat disagree,” “disagree” or “strongly disagree.” For the purpose of our analysis, we combined “strongly agree” and “agree” and omitted the share of participants who answered “neutral.” The study’s original sample comprised 3,013 participants, and by the final survey, the study had retained 1,149 of the participants. Though the sample was unweighted, its demographic makeup remained similar between the first survey and the final survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> Notably, the sample for this survey is not representative of the general U.S. population: Participants tended to be more liberal, younger, whiter and less religious than the American public as a whole. So, while the findings can’t be extrapolated to everyone in the country, several political scientists who did not conduct the research but reviewed the findings told us that the survey’s results are nevertheless an intriguing signal of how some Americans — particularly people on the left — might be responding to the leak.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Panelists likelier to say others support abortion rights after leak" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mxvD5/21/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="634" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">After the leak, self-identified conservatives were also more likely to say that other people supported legal abortion, although the effect was smaller than among self-identified liberals. In other words, the news that the Supreme Court appears poised to overturn Roe may have made a higher share of panel participants think that Americans want to <em>keep</em> those protections, regardless of what they personally think about abortion. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the survey, personal attitudes toward the legality and morality of abortion shifted little in response to the leak. But Clark and Paluck believe that media coverage of the leak may have jolted some Americans — particularly liberals — into realizing that support for abortion rights is more widespread than they’d thought. “The leak comes out, and then there are all these headlines about outrage, about how this is going against the majority opinion of Americans,” Clark, a doctoral student in social psychology who is leading the study, told me. “That actually appears to be changing how some people are thinking about the social environment around them — what other people find to be acceptable.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s worth reiterating: Paluck and Clark’s sample is unweighted, and therefore, it isn’t representative of the country as a whole. That being said, the findings do point to how liberals in particular might be thinking about the issue. “It’s likely that [the study’s participants] do reflect a large proportion of Americans — we just can’t say with certainty that they do,” said <a href="https://govt.dartmouth.edu/people/sean-jeremy-westwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Westwood</a>, a professor of government at Dartmouth College who reviewed the study’s findings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The strength of the study is its ability to return to the same participants again and again and to see what does — and doesn’t — change their minds. And the leak did have an impact on some of those participants. “I think what we’re seeing here is an epiphany of sorts,” said <a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald P. Green</a>, a professor of political science at Columbia University who also reviewed the study’s findings. “You see the liberal public, especially, being increasingly alarmed at the prospect of an activist, conservative court. It’s like they’re poker players who have just seen someone lay down their hand.” This lines up, too, with other recent polling suggesting that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats are more likely</a> to identify as “pro-choice” than they were before the leak.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The study also picked up a shift in panel participants’ view of the Supreme Court more broadly. The share of participants who believe the Supreme Court is conservative also rose after the leak. Unlike the shift in perceptions of the extent to which other Americans support legal abortion, though, this change had been building for a while. The shift seems to have accelerated between a survey from August 2020 and one from November 2021.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two months represent the sixth and seventh surveys in the study. The researchers did not conduct a survey for this study in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> And it was likely affected by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal, being <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-amy-coney-barrett-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative</a>, giving the court’s right wing an even stronger, six-justice majority.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Panelists say the Supreme Court is growing more conservative" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XDnVe/15/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="640" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Those results are especially noteworthy given the findings of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2120284119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another recent study</a> from a group of scholars who have tracked public opinion of the court’s decisions over more than a decade. The court’s opinions have taken a sharp right turn in recent years, but not everyone realized that was happening. “​​Democrats are kind of bad at understanding how conservative the court is,” said <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/msen/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maya Sen</a>, a professor at Harvard University and one of the co-authors of the paper. But it makes sense, she added, that the leak would have changed that, at least for some people. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Sen, people tend to widely recognize only two Supreme Court cases — Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade. “So boom, we have the news that the court is going to overturn this quite popular, very widely known precedent,” she said. Clark and Paluck’s findings make a lot of sense in that context. “There’s a huge spotlight that’s all of a sudden being shined on a court that’s been operating under the radar, and showing this is actually a really conservative court,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The leaked opinion, of course, was just a draft. At some point in the next few weeks, the actual ruling will come out, and it could look different. But Clark said that if the court does overturn Roe, outrage would could easily continue to grow. After all, such a ruling would lead to more media coverage as well as more discussion of how the court’s decision <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-americans-stand-on-abortion-in-5-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t reflect where most Americans stand</a> on abortion. Even if people’s individual views don’t change much, the perception that the court's action is out of step with public opinion could embolden people on the left to protest and talk to their neighbors about the issue — which could, in turn, reinforce the perception that the court’s action is far more conservative than many Americans want.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And ultimately, that could be dangerous for the Supreme Court. In the past, the justices <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-can-stop-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have generally hewed to public opinion</a>, in part because there’s always the possibility that they could be reined in by the other branches of government. Right now, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/is-it-time-to-expand-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the risk to the court looks pretty low</a> since few congressional Democrats seem interested in adding more justices to the court — which is their main option for responding. But the findings from Clark and Paluck’s study, as well as from the study co-authored by Sen, suggest that court reform could get more popular. Clark and Paluck found that, after the leak of the Dobbs draft, the liberal participants in their panel survey were more in favor of reducing the court’s power to decide certain types of controversial issues, and Sen and her co-authors similarly found that Democrats who were more aware of how conservative the court really is were more in favor of measures to curb its power. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether that will translate into action by politicians is, of course, much harder to predict. But these findings suggest that overturning Roe isn’t a risk-free proposition for the justices — in fact, a backlash could already be brewing.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The carnage was impossible to deny. As the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol laid out its evidence that former President Donald Trump was the catalyst of the assault on American democracy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3_O91gyj9o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 12-minute video</a> showed the full consequences of Trump’s willful lie that the election was stolen. It was perhaps the committee’s most compelling argument. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The video — which included images recorded by participants in the attack, security footage, news footage, audio recordings from police radio communication and police body-camera recordings — tracked the evolution of the violence on that day, from an agitated crowd gathering at the outskirts of the Capitol, through the bloody, forceful invasion of the building. Much of the footage was raw and played at length; the violence was visceral. In one clip, a first-person view from a fallen U.S. Capitol Police officer’s body camera, you can see the mob bearing down, beating the officer mercilessly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can watch as many clips of Jan. 6 participants calmly strolling through the rotunda as you like, but the footage shared during the hearing make it inarguable that this was no “normal tourist visit,” as GOP <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/18/clyde-tourist-capitol-riot-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Andrew Clyde claimed</a> four months after the attack. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Past <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-host-a-congressional-hearing-that-actually-like-does-something/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockbuster congressional hearings</a> have had blockbuster testimony — and this hearing had that too. But what made Thursday night’s opener of the committee’s series of hearings different was the frequent and effective use of media to bolster the narrative the committee presented.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The task before the committee is significant. In a country so polarized that it cannot agree on what took place during a historic event we all witnessed collectively in real time, the facts matter. The committee is challenged to lay out those facts for a clear accounting of what happened that day, the democratic threat it represented, and the president’s role in provoking it. This is not to prosecute those involved (that’s the job of the Department of Justice) but to protect against further erosion of democracy. Because without a common understanding of just how insidious the attack on Jan. 6 was, it could easily happen again, and the country risks sliding toward authoritarianism. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Whether the public will accept that accounting is a greater challenge, but one the committee is attempting to meet, in part, by emphasizing the bipartisan work being done. Rep. Liz Cheney, one of just two Republicans on the committee, led the majority of the first hearing, a clear attempt to highlight that this was not a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/us/politics/jan-6-hearings-tv-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political sham witch hunt</a>,” as GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik has claimed. The committee is also attempting to limit partisan grandstanding, instead moving through the process in a methodical, calm manner while allowing testimony and video footage to speak for itself, according to Dannagal Young, a communications professor at the University of Delaware.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Politics is performance. It always has been,” she said. “But that doesn’t change the content of the investigation. It doesn’t change what happened on that day.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Videos — some previously released, others being aired for the first time — were carefully sprinkled throughout the hearing, punctuating information shared by Cheney and committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson. Even in his opening remarks, Thompson included video to underscore the fact that the 2020 election was not stolen from Trump, signaling how big a role media would play in the hearings to come. Warning that the clip contained “strong language,” Thompson paused his remarks to play a clip from former Trump Attorney General Bill Barr’s testimony to the committee, where Barr said he remembers at least three discussions with the president where “I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president was bullshit.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Later, clips of testimony from Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, another senior White House adviser, demonstrated that those closest to the former president were aware that his claims of fraud were baseless. Video testimony of defendants charged for their alleged involvement in the attack saying that they were in Washington, D.C., that day because Trump had summoned them underscored the president’s role in inspiring the attack. Footage of Caroline Edwards, a U.S. Capitol Police officer on the front lines that day, being knocked unconscious after the mob plowed past a barricade toward her punctuated her live testimony on how violent Jan. 6 was. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Politically speaking, hearing people like Bill Barr and Ivanka Trump say that they knew that there was no fraud and that the election wasn’t stolen is quite powerful because these are people who are very much in Donald Trump’s inner circle admitting that they knew the election was not stolen,” said Steven Webster, a professor of political science at Indiana University Bloomington. “When you have people that close to the president, even his own children, saying there’s no fraud here, that’s a very powerful image.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For those who have kept a close eye on the news, there was little revelatory in this first hearing. But even for those of us who consume this news religiously, the asynchronous discovery of each new piece of information can make it difficult to keep the timeline and details straight. That’s why the methodological retelling in the calm, bureaucratic setting of a congressional hearing is still valuable, even without any bombshell revelations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Prior to the start of the hearing, majority committee member Rep. Adam Schiff told FiveThirtyEight the committee was planning to “present the evidence we have gathered through both live testimony and a variety of media, so as to be both highly engaging and deeply informative.” That media — video, audio and social media posts — was the committee’s preferred tool to try to overcome its many challenges in creating a consensus understanding of Jan. 6, 2021. In a country as polarized as the U.S., where trust of the opposite party is so low, the committee is hoping that seeing with our own eyes and hearing with our own ears will make the truth undeniable. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (June 12, 2022, 11:35 a.m.):</strong> With <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/22SPECPRIM/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">108,981 ballots</a> counted so far, Sarah Palin (30 percent), Nick Begich (19 percent) and Al Gross (13 percent) are the top vote-getters so far in Alaska’s special U.S. House election. Mary Peltola currently leads for the fourth and final slot in the August general election with 8 percent, followed closely by Tara Sweeney with 5 percent. Additional batches of results are expected to be released on June 15, June 17 and June 21.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">A groundbreaking new election structure. The 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee. Santa Claus. What <em>doesn’t</em> the special election for Alaska’s U.S. House seat have?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Well, a winner. This Saturday is technically <a href="https://elections.alaska.gov/specialelections.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election day</a> for the first round of the special election, which is being held to replace legendary former Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving Republican in House history who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/obituaries/don-young-obituary-alaska.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed away on March 18</a>. But because the election is being conducted predominantly by mail and ballots don’t need to be received until June 21, we won’t know which candidates have advanced to the second round until later in the month. And, of course, we won’t know who actually wins the seat until after the general election date of <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/03/22/alaska-special-election-to-fill-don-young-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aug. 16</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the primary is plenty interesting on its own. First of all, it will winnow a field of <a href="https://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/candidatelistspecprim.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48 candidates</a>(!) down to four. Why four and not two? Because following the passage of an <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/11/17/alaska-becomes-second-state-to-approve-ranked-choice-voting-as-ballot-measure-2-passes-by-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election-reform ballot measure</a> in 2020, Alaska now uses a unique top-four primary system whereby all candidates (regardless of party) run on the same ballot and the top four finishers advance to the general election. (In a further twist, the general election will also use <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maine-is-trying-out-a-new-way-to-run-elections-but-will-it-survive-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting</a>.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are three front-runners who seem likely to make the cut. The first is a familiar name to not only Alaskans, but also most Americans: former Gov. Sarah Palin. It feels like a lifetime ago, but Palin was <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/sep/03/john-mccain/she-wins-popularity-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most popular governors in the country</a> when she was chosen as former Sen. John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election. But her rising star blinked out shortly after that: She came to be seen nationally as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2008/10/06/post-debate-palin-still-seen-as-unqualified-a-bump-for-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unqualified</a> for office, and in 2009 (after losing the vice presidency) she unexpectedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/us/politics/04palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned the governorship</a> (apparently because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/us/06palin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethics investigations into her</a> were taking a financial and mental toll). For the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/sarah-palin-seriously-interested-in-2016-bid-114548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next several years</a>, there was <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/article/sarah-palins-arizona/2011/05/25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a> that she would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/07/sarah-palin-tea-party-speech1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run for office</a> again, but she never did — until this year. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These days, though, Palin is not popular in Alaska — according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148655178928128?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6-9 poll</a> from Alaska Survey Research, 59 percent of likely special-election voters had a negative opinion of her, while just 36 percent had a positive one. But she still has a small, devoted fan base that gave her 19 percent of the primary vote in <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148572958035968?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that same poll</a>, more than any other candidate. And that fan base includes one very important non-Alaskan: former President Donald Trump, who has <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/04/trump-endorses-palin-in-bid-for-alaskas-sole-house-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed her</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, a Republican with more room to grow might be businessman Nick Begich III. In contrast with Palin — who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2016/01/13/a-peek-inside-sarah-palins-arizona-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought a house in Arizona</a> after her governorship — Begich’s Alaska ties are rock-solid: His grandfather was former Rep. Nick Begich Sr., whose <a href="https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/news/pilot-talk/2020/09/21/1972-cessna-310c-alaska-disappearance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disappearance in 1972</a> triggered the <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2019/03/06/don-young-46-years-in-an-office-he-never-expected-to-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special election</a> that brought Young to Congress. (The elder Begich was actually a Democrat, but the younger one says he’s a “<a href="https://www.alaskansfornickbegich.com/meet-nick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifelong Republican</a>.”) Begich has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01083/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.2 million</a> (including $650,000 in self-funding) to Palin’s <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK00226/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$631,690</a>, and he enjoys the Alaska Republican Party’s <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/04/22/alaska-gop-endorse-begich-for-us-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement</a>. He snagged 16 percent in that Alaska Survey Research poll, too, which was good for second place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The third front-runner is fisherman-physician Al Gross, who is the only other candidate who has raised more than a quarter of a million dollars (he’s raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01166/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$545,745</a>) and the only other candidate who registered in the double digits in the Alaska Survey Research poll (13 percent). Gross is a contender, in part, because he still has plenty of name recognition left over from his 2020 campaign for U.S. Senate, which could help him attract support from liberal (or at least not-conservative) Alaskans; though he is an independent, he ran in 2020 as the Democratic nominee.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Alaska’s old primary system, candidates could still run for — and win — a party’s nomination without being a member of that party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> However, this time around, Gross is <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/05/05/in-a-special-us-house-race-alaska-democrats-wonder-if-now-is-their-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the door open</a> to caucusing with either party if he wins, which has led to a <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/05/09/alaska-democrats-lash-out-at-us-house-candidate-al-gross-the-same-candidate-they-endorsed-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messy breakup</a> with the state’s actual Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That leaves a free-for-all for the fourth and final slot in the August general election. Financially, the best-positioned is former Assistant Secretary of the Interior Tara Sweeney, who has raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2AK01174/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$231,364</a> and has also benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/special-elections-outside-spending?cycle=2022&amp;id=AK01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$434,652</a> in super PAC spending. Sweeney, who would be the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress, has <a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/05/31/alaska-native-candidates-for-us-house-talk-land-into-trust-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pitched herself</a> as “a Ted Stevens and Don Young Republican” in reference to two long-serving former legislators who were more focused on constituent services and appropriations than conservative dogma.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Or — and I can’t believe this is actual, serious political analysis — name recognition could propel Santa Claus into the general election. Claus (<a href="https://www.santaclausforalaska.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a real person</a>) is a city councilor in North Pole (<a href="https://www.northpolealaska.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a real city</a>) and is essentially the Sen. Bernie Sanders of this race — a self-described “independent, progressive, democratic socialist.” Though he’s not accepting campaign contributions, 59 percent of likely voters could form an opinion of him in the Alaska Survey Research poll, more than any other candidate other than Palin, Begich and Gross. It was enough for him to place fourth in that poll, albeit within the margin of error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also several candidates with more traditional resumes and points in their favor. Republican John Coghill, for instance, still has 52 percent name recognition (as measured by the share of likely voters who can form an opinion of him) from his days as state Senate majority leader. Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Josh Revak, who used to work for Young, has been <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/04/13/revak-earns-endorsement-from-youngs-widow-in-alaskas-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by his widow</a>. And Anchorage Assemblyman Christopher Constant, former state Rep. Mary Peltola (who would also be the first Alaska Native in Congress) and state Rep. Adam Wool all have the advantage of being <em>actual</em> Democrats; if they don’t go for Gross, Alaska’s Democratic voters have to vote for someone. The problem with all these candidates, though, is that they have all raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/AK/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very little money</a>, and none of them registered above 5 percent in the poll.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In all honesty, though, it may not matter much who snags the fourth slot. When it comes to the general election, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes will be eliminated and their support redistributed to the candidates their voters ranked second. So unless the complexion of the race changes drastically during the next two months, the fourth-place finisher on Saturday will probably be the first to be eliminated in August. After all, that’s what the Alaska Survey Research poll found, no matter whether <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148601575776256?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeney</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148611402985472?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constant</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148622186541057?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peltola</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanMoore1/status/1524148632450043904?s=20&amp;t=CGvHxQxUoBQGQa0fdXtMfg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claus</a> was the fourth contender.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, in each scenario, it was Begich who emerged victorious after all the ranked-choice voting rounds were complete. This is certainly not guaranteed to be the case after two months’ of campaigning, but as a starting point, it makes sense: Among the three front-runners, Begich is the ideologically middle choice. If Palin is eliminated second, most of her support is likely to go to fellow Republican Begich, not Gross. And if Gross is eliminated second, most of his support is likely to go to Begich, not Palin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, the outcome of this special election is still far from certain, but it at least looks possible that this is one election where ranked-choice voting could make a material difference. Based on her high profile, Palin may well finish the primary in first place. Under the old system (and the one that most other states use), this would have made her the Republican nominee, and in a red state like Alaska, she likely would have won the general election against whoever Democrats nominated — despite her unpopularity. But the Alaska system prevents her from winning with just a plurality of the vote and ensures that the winner is someone who can (eventually) earn majority support. That probably won’t be Palin.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s 6:30 a.m. and your third alarm is blaring. Another 10 minutes and you’ll have to miss breakfast before going to work. You get up, brush your teeth, shower and start a pot of coffee while watching the morning news. After the station’s meteorologist tells you it’s sunny with a high of 70 degrees, a health reporter follows up with the COVID-19 forecast: red-alert level today, with a 75 percent chance of exposure in spaces with at least 50 people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You respond to the risk by taking a rapid test before leaving the house — snapping a picture of the negative result for your colleagues — and grabbing your N95 mask.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a hypothetical future, but one that a new team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working on. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics</a> got an initial $200 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan to recruit data scientists, epidemiologists and science communicators who will come up with forecasts for the public and promote data-based decision-making. CFA aims to operate “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/04/19/new-cdc-team-early-alert-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the National Weather Service, but for infectious diseases</a>,” said epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers, the new center’s associate director for science, in an April article in The Washington Post.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which would be great — except that the forecasts have less data to work with now than they’ve had in years. COVID-19 case data is less and less reliable thanks to rapid testing, for one. In addition, hospitalization data can lag behind trends in transmission and may become unavailable in the coming months. And new sources like wastewater surveillance aren’t yet ready to replace clinical data. Imagine producing a weather forecast without reliable temperature or humidity measurements.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two converging trends are causing case data to become less useful. First, more Americans are using at-home rapid tests, and second, fewer Americans are using lab-based PCR tests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">About six times as many at-home tests as PCR tests are being taken in the U.S., according to Mara Aspinall, a diagnostic-testing expert and health-care industry consultant. Using data from test manufacturers and retailers, Aspinall has kept a close eye on test capacity in the U.S. throughout the pandemic, and at this time last year, Americans were taking considerably more PCR tests than at-home tests.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unlike PCR test results, which are automatically reported by the labs that process the tests, the vast majority of at-home test results are not reported to public-health authorities. In recent months, PCR tests have also become less available. States such as <a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/vermont/2022/06/04/vermont-covid-testing-state-stop-free-testing-program-june-25/7496151001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont</a> and <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/04/06/colorado-closing-covid-testing-sites-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a> are shutting down free public-testing sites and directing patients to at-home tests and private health-care providers instead — even as government <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/03/29/1089355997/free-covid-tests-and-treatments-no-longer-free-for-uninsured-as-funding-runs-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding to cover tests for uninsured people has run out</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The official numbers we hear about on a daily basis, in terms of official COVID-19 cases, is becoming an increased undercount of the true number of infections that are circulating,” said Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida College of Public Health.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This increasing undercount leads to more uncertainty in COVID-19 forecasting, said Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard and the temporary director of science at CFA. As the quality of case data gets worse, “we’re more reliant on the delayed indicators, like hospitalizations and deaths,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">CFA scientists are currently focused on hospitalization data, which U.S. modelers find more reliable than case numbers: Lipsitch described it as the best source that is “routinely and uniformly reported.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hospital admissions — the number of COVID-19 patients newly admitted for treatment — can be particularly useful, said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas at Austin’s COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. This metric provides “a stabler signal” than case counts, even though it doesn’t typically show an increase until a week or two <em>after</em> a surge. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But when health agencies rely on hospitalization data as their main source for policy decisions, they “lose valuable time to prevent morbidity and mortality,” Salemi said. Essentially, by the time hospital admissions show a meaningful uptick, it’s already too late to prevent a surge that will cause more people to get seriously ill — and it will drive similar increases in long COVID that aren’t visible in hospitalization data at all.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lipsitch agreed that this delay is a problem. Hospitalization data reflects COVID-19 spread in the recent past; when using data about the past to identify trends in the present, “the present becomes more ambiguous, because the most timely signal was also the lowest quality.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In addition, Salemi said, hospitalization metrics face a problem of geography. While people living in every U.S. county may get infected with SARS-CoV-2, not every county has a hospital. For example, Alachua County, Florida, has a major health-care system where Floridians from several smaller, nearby counties go for treatment. Most of the hospitalizations from this region show up in Alachua County, not in the surrounding areas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even the imperfect hospitalization data may not always be available. When the Biden administration ends the national public-health emergency for COVID-19, hospitals and local health departments <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2022/05/13/the-biden-administration-fights-to-make-its-covid-funds-last-00032279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may no longer be required to report their data</a> to federal agencies. The emergency declaration will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/covid-19-public-health-emergency/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue beyond at least July 15</a>, but it’s unclear how long the administration will keep extending it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if the data does become even less reliable, then what? CFA is looking into alternatives, and wastewater monitoring is a top priority. Our sewers can provide more timely data than hospitalizations, and less biased data than cases. But wastewater is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-fight-against-covid-19-isnt-ready-to-go-to-the-sewers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far from a national surveillance system</a>: COVID-19 levels aren’t being tracked in water systems for much of the country, it takes time and resources to set up this tracking, and health agencies aren’t yet sure how to use the data once they do have it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lipsitch also wants to find a way to pinpoint <em>who</em> in a community is infected, with data that’s individual-level, not population-level like wastewater. Ideally, he would like to see the CDC perform population surveys, sampling a representative subset of Americans to estimate who has COVID-19. Such surveys could contribute to precise estimates of how many people in a given state or county are currently infected, driving forecasts of an individual’s chance at exposure if they go to work or school. British modelers consider similar surveys <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted by the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics</a> much more reliable than case counts, Lipsitch said. But there’s no comparison for these surveys in the U.S.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">CFA’s conversations about potential data sources and public-health actions are largely theoretical at this point, as the center is still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analysis/about/who-we-are.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team of only four people</a> — three of whom are “on loan” from their academic positions, as Lipsitch described it. Posting job descriptions for the center’s eventual 100 scientists and communicators is “taking longer than we had hoped,” he said. As of early June, <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/job/655773600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only one job posting</a> is open for applications.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As it works on scaling up, CFA faces a broader challenge: the CDC’s lack of authority over state and local health agencies. “Outside of a public-health emergency, CDC has no authority to require states to share data,” Lipsitch said. And even during the COVID-19 emergency, the agency has been unable to require sharing some key metrics, such as <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakthrough cases and deaths</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The CDC also has limited authority over Americans overall, and trust in the public-health system is waning. One recent poll showed that nearly one-third of the country <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinks the pandemic is already over</a>, while Congress consistently <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/congressional-stalemate-makes-a-quick-compromise-on-covid-funding-unlikely" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fails to deliver new funding</a> for COVID-safety measures. These may be concerning signals for the new forecasting center’s future: Even if the CFA is able to provide timely, accurate infectious-disease forecasts like what we have for the weather, how many people will actually act on the information?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (June 10, 2022, 6:09 p.m.): </strong>The CFA says its team has expanded to 14 people now. Five of them are splitting their time between the center and academic institutions or other CDC offices.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of the day on May 24, more than 400 children walked away from Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas as survivors. That single day of grade school will follow them for years, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-school-shootings-impact-survivors-in-the-long-term" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a formative trauma that increases their risks</a> of experiencing depression, missing school days and even earning less money over their lifetimes. Research shows that violence in the classroom harms kids regardless of whether it physically injures them. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were also more than 50 million children enrolled at other K-12 schools in the United States that day. Whether they were across town or across the country, many of those children will also have memories of May 24, 2022; sirens, blaring news reports, or the hushed, tense whispers of adults. They know something awful happened to kids just like them. Next year, they’ll do active shooter drills in their own schools and remember that this will be real someday for someone, even if it’s never real for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Is that, also, a kind of trauma? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is precious little known about how the impacts of school shootings ripple out to children in the rest of the community, state and nation. But there’s plenty of research that suggests the trauma of violence in general probably doesn’t stop at the specific location where it happened. And that, experts told me, means we need to be thinking differently about the damage violence can cause and who is at risk. </p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Despite the high-profile nature of school shootings, and mass shootings more broadly, the mental health impacts of these kinds of events have not been widely studied. Five years ago, Dr. Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health, co-published <a href="https://miningquiz.com/pdf/Mass_Shootings/The-Mental-Health-Consequences-of-Mass-Shootings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a review of research on how mass shootings impact mental health</a>. The 49 peer-reviewed papers he analyzed were mostly focused on what happened to direct survivors — people who were at the site of a mass shooting but left alive. There were only a few that addressed indirect exposure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These studies found evidence of trauma even for those who were not in the room or building where a mass shooting happened, though impacts were larger the closer people were to the actual incident. Other factors — such as media exposure, or the amount of time someone spent discussing the shooting with family and friends — also seemed to affect who came away with symptoms of trauma and how severe they were. But the amount of research on this subject was very small and incomplete, and it’s hard to say much with certainty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And according to Gaelea that is still true today. “The issue of mental health in community members who are not directly affected… most people in the mental health space think it’s a real issue but there actually has been very little research on it,” he told me. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, there’s lots of evidence that, in certain situations, people can have their mental health impacted by traumatic events even if they weren’t personally in physical danger. “We’ve known for 20 years that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching media images of people suffering</a> can, in and of itself, be a trigger for common mood anxiety disorders, things like depression and post-traumatic stress,” Galea said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Evidence suggests there are multiple kinds of indirect trauma, said Jennifer Carlson, a professor of sociology, government and public policy at the University of Arizona. Vicarious trauma, she said, is what happens when people like <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10926771.2012.689422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social workers are deeply exposed to the trauma of their clients</a> and feel helpless to prevent those people from experiencing traumatic events. Community trauma, meanwhile, happens when whole populations are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nuf.12550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collectively traumatized by something that affects everyone on a cultural level</a>, even if some individuals don’t experience it personally. The traumatic impact of the Holocaust on the Jewish community is a good example of this, as is the collective trauma expressed by Black Americans in the wake of the George Floyd murder. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This knowledge has implications for how we think about the trauma of school shootings, even if we don’t know exactly how school shootings are affecting the mental health of kids nationwide. People who aren’t affected physically by a disaster are often reminded that they have a low risk of experiencing something like that themselves. There are tens of millions of kids enrolled in school every year, but only <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/charts-graphs/#victimsperyear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little over a hundred a year</a> — if that — become direct victims of a school shooting. The risk is low. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that’s the wrong way to think about risk when we know a traumatic event will happen. The number of school shootings every year that involve active shooters are very small — <a href="https://www.chds.us/ssdb/charts-graphs/#incedentsbyyear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaging 5 per year between 2021 and 2011</a>, according to the Naval Postgraduate School’s K-12 School Shooting Database. But you have to go back to 1981 to find a year without at least one. School shootings are almost guaranteed to happen every year — we just don’t know to whom, Carlson said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that means the risk of harm isn’t just about the physical likelihood of being shot, it’s also about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0320-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anticipating a trauma that will happen to someone</a> — maybe even you — and feeling powerless to stop it and at the mercy of chance. “I am a sociologist of crime,” Carlson said. “I’m very much on board with [the idea that] people overestimate their likelihood of victimization.” But this is different, she said. The likelihood of anticipatory trauma can be high even if the risk of injury and death is low. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Given that, it’s useless to tell people not to be afraid of something like gun violence. It isn’t just about the personal risk of getting shot, Galea said. In 2016, he published an analysis that found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27667339/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chances of an American knowing a gun violence victim at some point</a> in their lifetime are nearly 100 percent. There’s a greater social burden than the statistics of direct risk can show. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There are certain moments in congressional history that have lived on even longer than the octogenarians who stalk the halls of Capitol Hill. They are the scenes that feel torn from the pages of a political drama: Sen. Howard Baker Jr. repeatedly asking during the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/curious-history-what-did-president-know-and-when-did-he-know-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watergate hearings</a>, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” Army lawyer Joseph Welch excoriating Sen. Joseph McCarthy with a rhetorical question during the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/mccarthy-hearings/have-you-no-sense-of-decency.htm#:~:text=Wisconsin%20Republican%20senator%20Joseph%20R,Department%20and%20other%20federal%20agencies." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Army-McCarthy hearings</a>: “Have you no sense of decency?” A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ZDQKq2F08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel of tobacco executives</a> testifying one by one before Congress, incredulously, that nicotine is not addictive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under the right circumstances, a congressional hearing can be a satisfying resolution to a tense political conflict, one that allows society to move forward. Doesn’t that sound nice right about now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is hoping its hearings will be remembered in the same light. On Thursday, the committee will begin a run of public hearings to reveal what its investigation has uncovered and provide guidance on how to avoid a similar assault in the future. Rep. Jamie Raskin has promised the hearings will “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jan-6-revelations-will-blow-roof-house-rep-jamie-raskin-says-rcna25542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blow the roof off the House</a>,” and in a statement to FiveThirtyEight, Rep. Adam Schiff said, “I wouldn’t expect these hearings to look like a typical congressional hearing.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But surely both of these majority committee members know how difficult it will be to change the public’s mind about what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. Polling shows many Americans (especially Republicans) think <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-moving-on-from-jan-6-even-if-congress-hasnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too much attention</a> has been paid to the attacks and say they are ready to “move on.” Furthermore, people who participated in the riot or support the “Big Lie,” the baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen, have already secured nominations across the country in primary elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, what makes for a memorable hearing? Well, taking place in the ’70s and ’80s is one ingredient. That was the golden age of congressional hearings, when the country was less polarized and news consumption more homogeneous. But maybe there’s still something to learn from those hearings of yesteryear — they may offer some hints as to how the Jan. 6 committee can recapture the magic.</p>



<h2><strong>New information</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In July 1973, two months into the Senate Watergate hearings, a former White House assistant named Alexander Butterfield made a startling revelation: There were recording devices in the West Wing. This disclosure not only shocked the public but also marked the beginning of the end for then-President Richard Nixon’s administration. While reporting from The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein revealed many details of the Watergate scandal, it wasn’t until the hearings — where individuals with firsthand knowledge were obliged to testify — that Nixon’s involvement became undeniable. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Excavating new information is what hearings are designed to do, and it can make them more appealing to the public, and more likely to effect change, according to Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="948" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg" alt="Alexander Butterfield Testifying" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg?w=712 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-515119202-711.jpg?w=1424 2x"><figcaption>Alexander Butterfield, a former deputy assistant to President Richard Nixon, brought a blockbuster revelation to the Watergate Senate hearings in 1973. <p>Bettman / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, we can see that impact in polling conducted before and during the Watergate hearings. At the start of these televised hearings in May 1973, the Watergate scandal had already knocked Nixon’s approval rating down 20 percentage points in four months to 48 percent, and by early August, it had dropped to 31 percent, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/25/how-the-watergate-crisis-eroded-public-support-for-richard-nixon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup polling cited by the Pew Research Center</a>. Likewise, prior to the hearings, 31 percent of Americans said they believed Watergate was a serious matter and not just politics, but by August, that number had climbed to a 53 percent majority. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Committee members also elicit new information by asking fact-finding questions, not by using these public hearings simply as a stage from which to speechify. But this is Congress — speechifying is an inevitability. Especially these days. Ju Yeon Park, a political scientist at the University of Essex who studies the communication style of American legislators, has found that <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/709147?journalCode=jop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grandstanding</a> — which she defines as using “hearings as opportunities to send political messages by taking positions on policy issues or framing the image of a party or the administration” — has grown more common in congressional hearings in recent years. She also has forthcoming research that shows more time spent grandstanding is correlated with better performance in the following election (which may, uh, help explain this behavior). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s tough to know, then, whether the Jan. 6 hearings will reveal new information or simply provide a platform for partisan grandstanding ahead of the midterms. There are still many unresolved questions about what happened in the days leading up to and on the day of the attack, and perhaps the hearings will be able to answer them.  </p>



<h2><strong>Insider witnesses</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another common component of history-making hearings is an insider witness. Congress has unique subpoena powers that can compel individuals to testify who may not otherwise have volunteered to do so. This has resulted in key moments like Butterfield’s revelation in 1973 or the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-09-mn-3189-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1987 testimony of former National Security aide Lt. Col. Oliver North</a>, when he took the fall for the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal during President Ronald Reagan’s administration. It has also facilitated moments when new information came to light and made for less partisan hearings, according to Jonathan Lewallen, a political scientist at the University of Tampa and the author of “Committees and the Decline of Lawmaking in Congress.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those witnesses can make a hearing feel like more than just one long session of ax grinding — and there’s been more of that lately, too. In recent years, Congress has held fewer hearings and is hearing from fewer witnesses, and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rego.12090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to research</a> from Lewallen published in 2015, those witnesses are presenting a narrower range of views. Lewallen and his colleagues found that, over the past 40 years, a greater share of congressional hearings are positional (essentially arguing only one side of an issue) rather than exploratory (when all sides of an issue are considered). In 1977-1978, only 19 percent of the hearings held were positional, but in 2007-2008, 30 percent were. Lewallen said that is due partly to having fewer witnesses and over-relying on government appointees, who are less likely to push against the party line.</p>

Republican figures who were heavily involved with then-President Donald Trump’s actions on the day of the Capitol attack have refused to testify to the committee, and as a result, at least two have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-jan-6.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-jan-6.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charged with contempt of Congress</a>. Former White House chief of staff <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jan-6-house-committee-meadows-trump/2021/12/14/ae2d10a8-5ce9-11ec-ae5b-5002292337c7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Meadows</a>, Trump’s onetime lawyer <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-new-york-mayor-giuliani-refuses-testify-before-us-capitol-riot-panel-2022-05-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rudy Giuliani</a>, former White House chief strategist <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-subpoena-capitol-attack-trump-1638839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Bannon</a> and a handful of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/gop-lawmakers-testimony-capitol-riot-00029322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP members of Congress</a> have all refused to testify. In May, the committee took the unprecedented step of actually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/12/1098509467/mccarthy-jan-6-panel-subpoena-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoenaing their Republican colleagues</a> to testify. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The committee has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/politics/list-january-6-subpoenas/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoenaed dozens of witnesses</a>, many of whom were either involved in planning the Trump rally that preceded the attack or helped him with his baseless campaign to overturn the 2020 election results, which fueled the attack. So, even if big names aren’t cooperating, we may hear some illuminating testimony. The committee also benefits from the mountain of media created on the day of the attack, including videos and photos from the attackers themselves. In his statement, Schiff said the committee “will present the evidence we have gathered through both live testimony and a variety of media, so as to be both highly engaging and deeply informative.”</p>



<h2><strong>Bipartisanship</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">That moment when Butterfield acknowledged the existence of recording devices in the West Wing was not only a revelation for the American public but also a carefully orchestrated moment of bipartisanship. Butterfield had already <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3447219&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the taping system</a> in a closed-door interview with committee staff three days before his public testimony. Since a Republican lawyer had asked the question that elicited Butterfield’s admission in the background interview, the committee agreed it was only fair to let a Republican ask the question on the public record, and so it was decided that the committee’s minority counsel, Fred Thompson (who was later elected to the Senate, in 1994) would be the one to do so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bipartisanship also played a key role in many famous hearings in U.S. history, according to Troy. “In the Army-McCarthy hearings, Eisenhower was working behind the scenes to try to make McCarthy look bad. So the Republicans were working with the Democrats to make it come out in a certain way. Obviously in the Watergate hearings, the Republicans were brought in for the big questions,” Troy said. “Cooperation brings better results — and results that the American people can embrace.”</p>

One example, he noted, was a <a href="https://www.levin-center.org/congress-investigates-kkk-violence-during-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional hearing after the Civil War</a> to investigate an emerging terrorist organization in the South: the Ku Klux Klan. While the hearings themselves were bipartisan, the Democrats rejected the findings laid out in the majority report and issued a minority report refuting all the facts found in the hearings, Townsend said. As a result, the hearings weren’t able to sway many minds.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Democrats constructed an alternative narrative. I mean, frankly, their own alternative facts that denied the existence of the KKK and put the blame on Northern so-called agitators and African Americans,” Townsend said. “We’ve been here before: an incredibly divided country where basic facts about whether terrorism, violent aggression against some people in our country was being explained in two very different ways.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well documented</a> at this point that American politics have become increasingly polarized over the past few decades. This affects not only how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American voters view one another</a> but also how much they trust elected officials who don’t belong to the political party they identify with. When asked whether each major political party could be described “very” or “somewhat” well as “govern[ing] in an honest and ethical way,” Americans rarely agreed when it came to the opposing party, according to a January <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-the-republican-and-democratic-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey from Pew</a>. Just 17 percent of Democrats said the Republican Party governed honestly and ethically, and 13 percent of Republicans said the same about the Democratic Party. Trust in the government overall has been <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declining for decades</a> as well, and partisans typically trust the government less when the opposing party is in power, according to Pew. And while Americans’ positive feelings toward their own party have remained steady since the ’70s, their <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/for-2015-0030/html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive feelings about the opposing party have been falling</a> — the gulf is only getting wider. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Positive feelings toward the other party have dropped sharply" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oTkZB/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="400" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">All of these findings underscore the importance of bipartisanship when trying to convene an effective hearing. To persuade partisans to pay attention and care about the information being presented, it has to come from their side of the aisle. “If one side — Republicans — are saying this is a partisan sideshow, then Republicans in the electorate are going to say this is a partisan sideshow,” said Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has been tracking the increasingly chilly feelings between partisans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this respect, the Jan. 6 hearings may have already failed before they’ve even begun. Although the committee is technically bipartisan, a majority of the members are Democrats. And including Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger — two of the 10 Republicans <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/14/956621191/these-are-the-10-republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who voted to impeach</a> Trump after Jan. 6 — hasn’t inspired a ton of faith among Republicans: In a March 31-April 4 <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Navigator-Toplines-04.05.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Global Strategy Group/GBAO</a>, 60 percent of Republicans said they agreed with a statement calling the Jan. 6 committee’s investigation “a partisan witch hunt.” Not to mention that Republicans in Congress have opposed the committee from the very beginning: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had GOP members <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000524897/senate-republicans-block-plan-for-independent-commission-on-jan-6-capitol-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block an independent commission</a> to investigate the attack. Then, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-mccarthy-jan6-committee/2021/07/21/21722d44-ea41-11eb-84a2-d93bc0b50294_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked two Republicans</a> from joining the commission, McCarthy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mccarthys-jan-6-committee-gamble-faces-big-test-spring-rcna23681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had fellow Republicans boycott the commission</a> and what little good will was left likely evaporated. The upcoming hearings will likely elicit a similar response. In April, McCarthy told NBC: “This is nothing but a political show.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">There have already been <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/query/0484b316-f676-44bc-97ed-ecefeabae077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">248 mass shootings this year</a>,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of June 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> according to the Gun Violence Archive. At this point in 2021, there had been 258 mass shootings; in 2020, 173. Mass shootings are defined by the Gun Violence Archive as incidents in which at least four people — not including the shooter — are injured or killed, and they have been on the rise in recent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It is often a select few mass shootings, though, that capture national headlines and spark outrage. Public opinion often shifts <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/support-for-gun-control-will-likely-rise-after-uvalde-but-history-suggests-it-will-fade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in favor of stricter gun laws</a> after high-profile mass shootings, like the one on May 14 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/14/nyregion/buffalo-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed 10 people in a racist attack</a> in Buffalo, New York, and the one on May 24 that killed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/victims-texas-school-shooting-uvalde/story?id=84948395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19 children and two teachers</a> at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It should be no surprise, then, that the <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/FiveThirtyEight-2022-midterm-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll</a>, which was conducted from May 26 to June 6 and went into the field two days after the shooting in Uvalde, found that concerns regarding gun violence had surged. Using Ipsos’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KnowledgePanel</a>, we interviewed the same 2,000 or so Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-2000-americans-about-their-biggest-concern-the-resounding-answer-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from our previous survey</a>, and of the 1,691 adults who responded, 42 percent named “crime or gun violence” as one of the most important issues facing the country, up 19 percentage points from the first wave of the poll released in early May.<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample is weighted to match the general population. This poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.9 percentage points. As was the case in the first wave of our survey, we asked respondents about the most important issues in three different ways: an open-ended question where they could write what issue or issues were most important to them, and then two multiple choice questions where respondents could choose up to three issues from a list of 20, including “other” or “none of these,” that they were either personally worried about or that they thought were most important to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a> This was by far the largest increase for any one issue we asked about, putting it behind only “inflation or increasing costs” as Americans’ top concern for the country.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="More Americans are concerned about gun violence" aria-label="Range Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2sVNi/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="593" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">How concerned Americans were about crime and/or gun violence did vary quite a bit by party, though, as Democrats and independents drove much of the shift. A solid majority of Democrats, 58 percent, named the issue as a top concern, up from 33 percent in early May, while 41 percent of independents said the same, up from 19 percent.<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independents included respondents who identified as “independent” or “something else,” or who skipped the question for party identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a> Republicans also became more worried about crime and/or gun violence, but the uptick was much smaller, going from 19 percent in May to 29 percent now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also found a sizable jump in the share of Black and Hispanic Americans who named crime and/or gun violence as one of the biggest issues for the country, which helps explain, in part, the higher degree of concern among Democrats, as Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/pp_2020-06-02_party-id_2-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more racially and ethnically diverse</a> than Republicans. The share of Hispanic Americans who cited the issue more than doubled, growing from 23 percent in May to 61 percent. To a lesser but still significant extent, the share of Black Americans who named gun violence or crime as a top issue also jumped, going from 35 percent in early May to 55 percent in our latest survey. White Americans were also more likely to be worried, but their overall level of concern was comparably lower: Thirty-five percent named the issue as a top worry, up from 19 percent a month ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Part of this dramatic shift can be explained by the sheer amount of media attention gun violence received in the days following the shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde. In fact, three-fourths of respondents reported having heard “a lot” about crime and/or gun violence in the news, more attention than any other issue we asked about received — even inflation (which around two-thirds said they had heard a lot about).<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked whether they had seen a lot of coverage of the 20 major issues we asked about in the past month, including “other” and “none of these.”&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">But, of course, as we said at the outset, this is often what happens in the wake of a high-profile mass shooting. As a result of heightened media coverage, there is an uptick in concern about gun violence and/or a lot more support for stricter gun laws. However, the spotlight tends to fade over time and shift to other issues, so Americans become less engaged with the issue and support for stricter gun laws reverts to where it once stood. We didn’t ask about support for stricter gun laws in this poll, but we do know that more Americans are worried about gun violence. Even before this survey, it was one of Americans’ top three issues, so we plan to follow up soon with a deeper dive to better understand what’s driving Americans’ concerns around gun violence and/or crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nothing changed quite as much as Americans’ concern around crime and/or gun violence in our poll, but there were a handful of other important changes regarding which issues Americans felt were most pressing for the country. Abortion, for instance, saw the second-largest change on net, likely thanks to increased media coverage of the issue in early May following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion</a> that suggests the court might be ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973. Nine percent of respondents in our survey named it as a top issue, up from just 4 percent a month ago. That said, abortion isn’t the issue that Americans in our poll are most worried about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather, that distinction still belongs to inflation. Americans are most worried about inflation, with even more respondents (56 percent) naming it as a concern than in our last survey (52 percent). This was in large part driven by Republicans, as 75 percent cited inflation as a major concern, up from 65 percent a month ago. Independents were also somewhat more likely to name it as a concern, 56 percent now versus 50 percent in May. Roughly 40 percent of Democrats named inflation as a concern, but this barely changed from our previous survey.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, political extremism and polarization remained a top issue overall, ranking third behind inflation and crime/gun violence after ranking second in our last survey. We dug more into this issue, too, and Americans' attitudes around political extremism and polarization in this survey, so we’ll examine those results more in-depth in an article early next week. But as we’ve outlined here, there’s no question that the big, topline finding in our second FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll is that more Americans are concerned about crime and/or gun violence — at least for now.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Tuesday, seven states held primary contests — California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew breaks down what the results in those states mean. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, more moderate candidates were able to win against challengers from the right (Republicans) and left (Democrats), although there was a sizable protest vote in some instances. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Contests in California served as a test of the strength of progressive appeals in a very blue state’s big cities. Progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was recalled in a landslide, and former Republican Rick Caruso advanced to the Los Angeles mayoral general election alongside Democratic Rep. Karen Bass. There were a couple surprises throughout the night, notably in Iowa, where once-rising Democratic star Abby Finkenauer lost the Senate primary to Mike Franken. The question, of course, remains whether a Democrat has any chance of winning a statewide election in a state that has swung decisively to the right.</p>
