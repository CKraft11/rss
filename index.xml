<p data-paragraph="main">The U.S. House of Representatives isn’t the only chamber whose district lines are being redrawn to reflect the 2020 census. State-legislative chambers are being redistricted too — and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-democrats-win-full-control-of-more-state-governments-than-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we’ve written in the past</a>, state legislatures are often where the laws that have the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-republicans-and-democrats-are-doing-in-the-states-where-they-have-total-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest impact on people’s daily lives</a> are passed. In the last year, state legislatures have passed numerous new <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/texass-new-law-is-the-climax-of-a-record-shattering-year-for-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election laws</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abortion restrictions</a>, <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pduAa/8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-transgender laws</a> and more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The book isn’t closed on legislative redistricting quite yet — <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C2Eto4eAHYwMT8sLXN03HUbOZICLCx8TGAX0RSI1YKE/pub?hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;output=html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven states</a> still don’t have new maps — but one trend is already clear: Just as congressional redistricting is producing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer swing districts</a>, very few state-legislative chambers <a href="https://www.governing.com/now/redistricting-continues-to-hurt-competition-in-state-legislatures?link_id=25&amp;can_id=5f27a3767bd4756f5c4ec89f31b71bbe&amp;source=email-this-week-in-statehouse-action-winter-blues-edition&amp;email_referrer=email_1432225&amp;email_subject=this-week-in-statehouse-action-winter-blues-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be competitive this decade</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we wouldn’t expect solidly Republican or solidly Democratic states to have competitive legislatures no matter how their maps are drawn, so we’ll only be focusing on battleground states in this article. But according to our analysis of state-legislative redistricting (using the same tools we use to analyze congressional redistricting on our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting tracker</a>), as well as conversations with experts in state-legislative elections, the legislatures in even many battleground states have been drawn to give one party a clear advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is not a new development, but we also found that redistricting changed the electoral calculus in several battleground states: Some legislative chambers got more competitive, while other previously contested chambers got sewn up for one party. So join us for an all-expenses-paid tour through all the state capitols you might (rightly or wrongly) expect to be up for grabs this decade.</p>



<h2><strong>Uncompetitive legislatures both before and after redistricting</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">First up: a trio of swing states whose legislatures have nonetheless been safely Republican for years — and figure to remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Georgia</strong> is perhaps the most egregious example. Although President Biden narrowly won the Peach State in 2020, a majority of districts in the new state Senate (32 out of 56) and state House (94 out of 180) are solidly Republican (which we define as having a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, designed for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> of R+15 or redder). The median seat in the state Senate is 16 percentage points redder than the state as a whole, and the median seat in the state House is 10 points redder, meaning Democrats would have to win the statewide popular vote by double digits in order to be favored to flip either chamber.</p>

Florida’s <a href="https://twitter.com/MappingFL/status/1486173530060308485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new state House map</a> has an <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficiency gap</a> (a measure of how efficiently distributed each party’s votes are) of R+8, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/MappingFL/status/1484258416130465800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Senate map</a> has an efficiency gap of R+9. According to the <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1946&amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academics who created the efficiency gap metric</a>, an efficiency gap above 8 points is a sign of a severely gerrymandered state legislature.</p>

The Badger State’s Senate and Assembly maps <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/03/23/u-s-supreme-court-throws-out-wisconsins-redistricting-plan/7142023001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are still up in the air</a>, but Carolyn Fiddler, who covers state legislatures for <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/tags/StatehouseAction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Kos Elections</a>, told FiveThirtyEight she doesn’t expect the final versions to be competitive either as they’re going to be very similar to the old maps, which were drawn by Republicans and kept them in power all of last decade. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, which took charge of choosing the new maps after the Republican legislature and Democratic governor failed to come to an agreement, has already decided to pick maps with <a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-supreme-court-sides-with-gop-proposal-for-least-change-approach-to-redistricting/article_bc518113-3caa-510a-96e8-567ce095b295.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as few deviations as possible</a> from last decade’s plans.</p>



<h2><strong>Legislatures that got less competitive in redistricting</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also a couple battleground states where the legislature <em>has</em> been competitive in recent elections, but are no longer in play after this round of redistricting. For example, the median seat in the <strong>Texas</strong> state House used to have a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+7 — 5 points bluer than the state’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overall partisan lean of R+12</a>. Now, though, the median seat has a partisan lean of R+16 — 4 points redder than the state and safely out of reach for state Democrats in most years.</p>

According to Chaz Nuttycombe, who forecasts state-legislative elections at the website <a href="https://cnalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNalysis</a>, Democrats would have to win at least one seat that even Biden didn’t win in 2020 in order to take control under the proposed map. “It can maybe, maybe flip in a blue wave midterm,” Nuttycombe said, but the chamber would no longer be perennially competitive.</p>



<h2><strong>Legislatures that got more competitive in redistricting</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Never fear, however — there are still some state-legislative chambers that will be competitive this decade. In fact, redistricting even made a handful of chambers <em>more</em> competitive, thanks largely to redistricting commissions and court intervention. For example, back in 2011, <strong>Michigan</strong> Republicans had unfettered control over redistricting and <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/maps-show-how-gerrymandering-benefitted-michigan-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drew state Senate and House maps designed to keep themselves in power</a>. And it worked: Thanks to median seats 8 and 11 points redder than the state as a whole (according to partisan lean), Republicans held onto both chambers throughout the decade even as Democrats won the Senate popular vote in 2018 and the House popular vote in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTxxrLQlnrEl9ocgwUM7EL4PasH-5lmyf7sttn2GSMg/edit#gid=235559234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012, 2014, 2018 and 2020</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, in 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot measure creating an independent redistricting commission, and the maps passed by the commission are dramatically fairer. The median-seat bias now favors Republicans by 1 point in the Senate and 3 points in the House; the efficiency gaps of both maps also significantly decreased. As a result, Democrats now have a realistic shot at a House majority for the first time since 2011 and a Senate majority for the first time since <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/blog/on-this-day-in-1984-senate-republicans-seize-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1984</a>.</p>

The commission consists of two Republican politicians, two Democratic politicians and a tie-breaking member who is supposed to be selected by the other four commissioners but, for the last two cycles, has been selected by the state Supreme Court after the commissioners deadlocked. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2011, when there was a Republican majority on the court, <a href="https://old.post-gazette.com/pg/11110/1140536-454.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Republican judge</a> was appointed to the position, and the commission produced a House map with an R+5 efficiency gap and R+6 median-seat bias.

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, there are legislatures that were competitive before this round of redistricting and remain so after. It may not be the first state that comes to mind when you think “swing state,” but <strong>Maine</strong> has one of the most competitive legislatures in the country. Although it’s a light blue state overall, both the state Senate and state House have small Republican median-seat biases. As a result, the tipping-point district in each chamber falls squarely in the “highly competitive” camp. With Democrats currently in control of both chambers, this will be a top GOP pickup target in 2022.</p>

Because of the delayed release of the 2020 census, the 2021 elections — which surprisingly saw Republicans take control of the chamber — were conducted under Virginia’s old state House map, which had a slight GOP bias (an R+4 efficiency gap and R+3 median-seat bias). However, under the new map (which was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/12/28/virginia-redistricting-final-maps-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drawn by a pair of bipartisan experts</a>), the median seat almost exactly matches the state’s D+5 partisan lean. On paper, the Virginia state Senate is a tougher climb for Republicans (with a median seat about 3 points bluer than the state as a whole), but Fiddler at Daily Kos said she’s still keeping the chamber on her radar.</p>

And Silver State Democrats drew maps that give the party a clear advantage: The state Senate’s median seat is 6 points bluer than the state as a whole, and the state Assembly’s is 8 points bluer. (The maps’ efficiency gaps are also <em>just</em> shy of the D+8 threshold that would suggest a severe gerrymander.) But because Nevada is still a slightly Republican-leaning state overall, this won’t be enough to put the chamber totally out of Republicans’ reach.</p>

The state’s independent redistricting commission drew a legislative map (the Arizona Senate and House use the same map, with each district electing one senator and two representatives) with a modest GOP bias: The new median seat is about 2 points redder than the state as a whole. However, that still gives the median seat a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+9, which would be difficult for Democrats to win — at least in another state. But Arizona is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving left at a fairly rapid pace</a>, so perhaps 2020 performance is the more relevant metric here — and the median seat on the new map voted for former President Donald Trump by less than 1 percentage point.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="846" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-desktop-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-desktop-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-desktop-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-desktop-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="1450" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-mobile-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-mobile-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-mobile-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rakich-bycoffe.STATE-LEGISLATURES.0405.AZ-legislative-mobile-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">At any rate, both parties are treating the Arizona Legislature like it’s competitive: Arizona shows up on both the <a href="https://dlcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2021_03_11_Comms_Press-Memo_v4-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee’s</a> and the <a href="https://www.rslc.gop/press-releases/rslc-announces-state-legislative-targets-for-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican State Leadership Committee’s</a> 2022 target lists. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, CNalysis’s Nuttycombe identified two other chambers that will probably be perennially competitive this decade: the New Hampshire state House and the Alaska state House. But it’s hard to put numbers on them: The <strong>New Hampshire</strong> state House has 400 districts, some of which are nested within each other and/or elect multiple members. According to Fiddler, that makes it unpredictable, but it’s expected to retain its bouncy tendencies (since before the 2018 election, it has gone from a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_011018_26973.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">218-175 Republican majority</a> to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_2020_April%201.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">234-162 Democratic majority</a> to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/elections/Legis_Control_2-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">213-187 Republican majority</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the district lines of the <strong>Alaska</strong> state House aren’t even complete yet, as the Alaska Supreme Court last month <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/03/25/alaska-supreme-court-finds-anchorage-state-senate-map-is-unconstitutional-political-gerrymandering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered certain districts to be redrawn</a>. But the final map may not matter much anyway. The reason the Alaska House is competitive isn’t the election results; <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_House_of_Representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1994</a>, Republicans have always won a majority of districts in this red state. It’s that, for the last six years, some moderate Republicans and independents have <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2016/11/09/alaska-senate-will-remain-under-republican-control-for-the-next-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen to vote with Democrats</a> to give them de facto control of the chamber. So the battle for control of the Alaska House in 2022 and beyond will likely be won or lost in GOP primaries and in the backrooms of Juneau.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While some other chambers could get suspenseful in a wave election, that is the extent of those that will be regularly contested, according to the experts we talked to. In other words, only about 20 out of the nation’s 99 state-legislative chambers<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nebraska Legislature has only one chamber, which is why there aren’t 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> look like they could be genuinely competitive this decade. While a lot of that is due to underlying partisan polarization, biased maps contribute to the problem in at least eight chambers as well. A lack of fair maps is not just a problem on the congressional level.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Is the Republican tent big enough to include both Reps. Liz Cheney and Madison Cawthorn? Or might the two of them be on the outs come fall? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cheney is facing one of the toughest primaries in the country after voting to impeach former President Donald Trump for his role encouraging supporters to raid the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cawthorn, on the other hand, is all-in on Trump’s vision for the Republican Party — and then some. Last week, after Cawthorn <a href="https://twitter.com/patriottakes/status/1508127124498141187?s=20&amp;t=SstXpFI41o2zE_WAaWj3dA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested his colleagues</a> in Washington, D.C., host orgies and use cocaine, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he’d lost trust in Cawthorn and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, from Cawthorn’s home state of North Carolina, endorsed Cawthorn’s primary challenger.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses how these two primaries serve as a test of what the Republican Party and its voters will and won’t accept. They also try to get to the bottom of whether Americans support the “Parental Rights In Education Bill” — or what its critics call the “Don’t Say Gay Bill” — which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last week. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Despite being a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/liz-cheney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable Republican vote</a> for <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/liz-cheney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of two-plus terms</a> in the U.S. House, Rep. Liz Cheney hasn’t been afraid to buck her party when it comes to former President Donald Trump. The Wyoming representative was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/9-of-the-10-house-republicans-who-voted-for-impeachment-already-have-primary-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of just 10 House Republicans</a> who voted to impeach Trump in January 2021. She <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/10/07/wyoming-voters-liz-cheney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has called Trump</a> a “clear and present danger” to American democracy. She supported the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol that Trump incited. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/us/politics/cheneys-jan-6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheney has even</a> earned praise <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/165776/liz-cheney-reelection-democrats-odd-bedfellows-neoconservatism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Democrats</a>, a remarkable turn of events for the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/political-rehabilitation-dick-cheney-courtesy-000100847.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whom Democrats loathed</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Cheney’s anti-Trump stance <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-voters-say-they-dont-mind-trump-critics-but-liz-cheneys-ouster-says-otherwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could doom her career in the Republican Party</a> — where <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/trump_favorable?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump remains popular</a> — by sparking intense opposition to her both at home and in Washington. On Capitol Hill, House Republicans ousted Cheney from party leadership and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/03/rnc-cheney-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican National Committee voted to condemn her</a> for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/02/liz-cheney-vice-chair-capitol-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serving on the House committee</a> investigating the events of Jan. 6. In Wyoming, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-liz-cheney-ousted-wyoming-gop/story?id=81206853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the state GOP has excommunicated her</a>, while party committees all around the state <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/laramie-county-gop-votes-censure-181600977.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have formally censured her</a>. And now she faces a stern challenge in Wyoming’s 2022 GOP primary — the state has only one congressional district — from Harriett Hageman, an attorney and former RNC member who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/trump-endorses-harriet-hageman-cheney-challenger/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has endorsements from both Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/kevin-mccarthy-harriet-hageman-endorsement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, Cheney may face more danger in her primary <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-but-one-house-republican-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-faces-a-trump-endorsed-challenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than any other House Republican running in 2022</a>. But could she be saved by … Democrats? On March 8, <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/crossover-voting-will-remain-in-wyoming-after-party-affiliation-bill-dies-in-legislature/article_bf81046f-2e79-5d27-bb1d-e1bce76aa84a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyoming’s legislature scrapped a bill</a> seeking to end the state’s “crossover voting” provision. That rule <a href="https://www.natronacounty-wy.gov/Faq.aspx?QID=126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permits voters to switch parties on Election Day</a>, which could allow registered Democrats and other non-Republicans to change their registration to support Cheney in the Aug. 16 GOP primary. The legislature’s deliberations over the bill, which <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/donald-trump-backs-legislation-to-end-crossover-voting-in-wyoming/article_8dcb04c8-e217-5f8d-92ff-9ef8f40a0ba2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump had supported</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-liz-cheney-republican-primary-crossover-voting-election-laws-2022-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked a raft</a> of headlines <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/liz-cheneys-re-election-prospects-doubt-national-profile-grows-rcna17265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising the prospect</a> of crossover voters <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/597511-wyoming-legislature-kills-crossover-voting-ban-despite-trumps-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being key</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-backed-wyoming-elections-bill-fails-to-pass-in-boon-to-liz-cheney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheney’s survival</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is otherwise: Only Republicans can really save Cheney’s political future. If <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/09/us/politics/liz-cheney-wyoming-republicans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she’s counting</a> on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/14/liz-cheney-democrats-wyoming-00016905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anyone else</a>, then she’s probably done for.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The math just doesn’t work for Cheney if she’s looking for substantial help from non-Republicans in Wyoming’s GOP primary without winning a healthy share of Republicans first. The vast majority (<a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/VRStats/2022/22MarVR_stats.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent</a>) of voters in the state are registered Republicans. And in midterm years (like 2022), an even larger share of the state’s primary voters have cast ballots in GOP nomination battles, as the table below shows — meaning they’re very likely reliably Republican-leaning Wyomingites. And of course, in a state as red as Wyoming — Trump <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=56&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garnered 70 percent of the vote</a> there in 2020 — winning the GOP primary is tantamount to winning the election in November.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s look at what happened in 2018, when almost 100,000 more votes were cast in the Republican primary than in the Democratic contest. Although a <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/poll-friess-gordon-in-dead-heat-in-wyoming-gop-governor-race/article_d0f4bfca-a0ca-11e8-accc-bb7d34156640.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super-competitive GOP nomination race for governor</a> partly explains that discrepancy,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hageman actually &lt;a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/2018/Results/Primary/2018_Statewide_Candidates_Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;finished third in that race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a> the 2018 cycle marked the third consecutive midterm in which more than 80 percent of the votes cast in the two major-party primaries came on the GOP side. Now, some of those voters might be Democrats or independents who vote in the GOP primary because it will determine the winner in most Wyoming elections. But in a state where the Republican presidential nominee <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=2020&amp;fips=56&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;type=state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually wins 65 to 70 percent of the vote</a>, it’s clear that <em>most</em> of those primary voters are dyed-in-the-wool Republicans or at least lean toward the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So let’s do a little back-of-the-envelope math to consider Cheney’s position based on what we know about the current state of the race and recent Wyoming primaries. There has been little recent public polling of the race, but <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq0hidvbl0dklfm/PollingProfessor-MemoFiveRaceSynopsis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a December survey from SoCo Strategies</a> put her behind Hageman by 20 percentage points, and older polls found <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/cheney-in-trouble-77-gop-would-not-reelect-53-call-her-liberal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her support</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickReynolds/status/1420482244334952448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorability among Wyoming Republicans</a> in the 20s — evidence that she’s in rough shape. For argument’s sake, let’s say that Cheney trails by 10 points among registered Republicans in the final days of the primary campaign (possibly a rosy scenario, considering her polling numbers). So Hagerman has 50 percent, Cheney 40 percent and the four or so other candidates attract the remaining 10 percent (<a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/2022/2022_Key_Election_Dates.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the candidate filing deadline</a> is May 27, so the field could expand or retract further). If there are around 110,000 voters who were registered Republicans <em>before</em> primary day — a reasonable guess since nearly 117,000 total voters participated in the 2018 GOP primary for governor<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That total includes crossover voters and, as will be discussed below, new registrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> — Hageman would lead by around 11,000 votes. Based on the 2018 primary, Cheney would then need nearly 60 percent of the total Democratic primary voters to not only switch to vote in the GOP contest but to also vote for her.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, if the race proved to be closer, and/or if another GOP contender — say, state Sen. Anthony Bouchard — took more of the anti-Cheney vote from Hageman, <em>perhaps</em> crossover voters could make the difference for Cheney. Let’s say Hageman is up, with 42 percent to Cheney’s 37 percent among registered Republicans, while Bouchard sits at 15 percent (and other candidates win the remaining 6 percent). In that case, Cheney would trail by about 5,500 votes, or about 30 percent of the total number of Democratic primary votes in 2018. It’s not out of the question that the red-hot spotlight on Cheney’s race could encourage significant crossover voting among Democrats, especially if there isn’t much happening in the Democratic primary. Things could play out that way, considering so far <a href="https://www.thegreenpapers.com/G22/WY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no notable Democrats have declared</a> in Wyoming’s races <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/elections/house/WY/00/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the House</a> or <a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/new-candidate-announces-bid-for-governor/article_43b18b59-330e-5186-87ba-6739f5f48107.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor</a> (neither of Wyoming’s U.S. Senate seats <a href="https://www.270towin.com/2022-senate-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are up in 2022</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this still means that Cheney must remain competitive among Republicans to even allow for a scenario where crossover voters could conceivably put her over the top. Granted, she has a huge financial edge — at the end of 2021, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H6WY00159/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheney had raised $7.2 million</a> to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2WY00166/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hageman’s $745,000</a> — which the incumbent can use to damage Hageman and play up her conserative bonafides. And Cheney’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitt-romney-american-democracy-extraordinary-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealthy backers</a> might also look to <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreyvs/status/1503412537391525889?s=20&amp;t=cA6y1UeX0yln3UiyZ34ozQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise the profile</a> of one of the other anti-Cheney contenders in the hopes of fragmenting her opposition. (Promoting another candidate for your benefit is a dark campaign art practiced by <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/todd-akin-missouri-claire-mccaskill-2012-121262/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past vulnerable incumbents</a>, although usually by trying to influence the <em>other</em> party’s primary.) However, even if Cheney’s allies wanted to go that route, the <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/the-cheney-challenger-lurking-on?s=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most obvious choice</a> for prospective assistance looks to be toxic: Bouchard, the state senator, has seen his <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2022/02/01/bouchards-campaign-donations-slow-again-in-latest-quarter-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundraising dry up</a> after Hageman’s entry into the race and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/us/politics/anthony-bouchard-14-year-old.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revelations that he impregnated a 14-year-old girl</a> when he was 18 years old.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Beyond any hypothetical campaign intrigue, the fact is that Wyoming’s Election Day registration rules may not even boost Cheney’s chances as much as the conventional wisdom might believe. Wyoming not only permits voters to switch parties at the polls, but it also <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows same-day voter registration</a>. So while crossover voters might participate in the GOP primary, there could be even more same-day registrants, many of whom might be newly engaged Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Consider the 2018 GOP primary for governor, when <a href="https://wyofile.com/friess-suggests-election-law-change-following-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some conservatives claimed</a> that now-Gov. Mark Gordon won the party nomination thanks to crossover votes from non-Republicans. Gordon won by about 9,000 votes, but an <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/crossover-voting-had-little-impact-on-wyo-primary-election-study-shows/article_c74d954e-b71f-11e8-8f4e-3355c6638aec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis of voter registration data</a> found that party switching probably didn’t affect the outcome. The GOP added around 8,200 registered voters on primary day, but Democrats lost only about 1,800 registrants, while independents and other third-party registrations dropped by about 2,700 voters. That meant that a plurality of new Republican voters came from fresh registrants rather than party-switching, as about 3,700 new voters joined the rolls (mostly with the GOP). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thinking about the 2022 GOP primary, there’s no guarantee that same-day Republican registrants are going to be favorably inclined toward Cheney; they may be predisposed to oppose her, in fact.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that gets back to the fundamental truth for Cheney: Her political future rests on winning over Republican voters rather than winning over Democratic or independent voters. She needs a good deal of the former for the latter to matter at all.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Thursday was supposed to be opening day of the 2022 Major League Baseball season, but it was delayed a week (to next Thursday, April 7) by a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22967489/mlb-lockout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious labor dispute</a> between players and team owners that lasted much of the winter. The MLB lockout left fans feeling frustrated — especially with team owners — and, they claim, less interested in the sport. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll stop root-root-rooting for the home team. And that holds a lesson even for those who aren’t baseball fans: Be skeptical when a poll says an issue will make people more or less likely to do something (like, say, vote a certain way).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, some background: At the end of Dec. 1, the collective bargaining agreement that governed MLB players’ relationship with their employers (i.e., the 30 MLB teams) expired. In response, the team owners <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/32761620/mlb-mlbpa-fail-reach-new-labor-agreement-league-issues-lockout-first-1990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented a lockout</a> (essentially the management version of a strike) preventing the players from going to work<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baseball season was over by this point, so the lockout didn’t immediately cancel any games, but players still couldn’t sign new contracts with teams, work out at team facilities or even talk to their former employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> until the owners and the players union reached a new agreement. For the next few months, the two sides slowly negotiated everything from specific rule changes to the biggest bone of contention, player salaries. Eventually, on March 10, they <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33399466/mlb-mlbpa-reach-labor-agreement-everything-need-know-lockout-ends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to a new deal</a>, but not before the first several games of the season were called off. (They have now been rescheduled for later in the year.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to two polls conducted just before the lockout ended, fans generally sided with the players in the dispute. Forty-five percent of self-identified MLB fans told <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/08/mlb-lockout-blame-cba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult</a> that the owners were most responsible for the two sides’ failure to agree, while only 21 percent said the players were most responsible. Similarly, a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/lat-mlb-lockout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey/Los Angeles Times poll</a> found that 31 percent of MLB fans blamed the owners most for the lockout, while only 12 percent blamed the players most (however, 49 percent said they blamed both sides equally). According to SurveyMonkey/the Los Angeles Times, fans agreed, 65 percent to 26 percent, that the players were negotiating in good faith, but fans narrowly <em>dis</em>agreed that the owners were doing so, 49 percent to 42 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, in past labor disputes, fans generally sided with MLB owners. For example, during the notorious 1994-95 strike (which canceled the 1994 World Series), an <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31094757/questions#ce244979-2faa-4e04-b4f8-b0917257be4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</a> found that 45 percent of fans held the players more responsible and only 27 percent held the owners more responsible (while 24 percent volunteered that both sides were equally responsible). Why the reversal? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For one thing, in a very literal sense, the owners were responsible for the recent lockout: They didn’t have to implement it (legally, the business of MLB could have continued under the old collective bargaining agreement while a new one was being negotiated), but they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mlb-lockout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose to do so to gain leverage over the players</a>. In addition, owners reportedly pulled a fast one on the players at times during negotiations, such as <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/03/02/mlb-lockout-ross-stripling-criticizes-owners-negotiation-tactics-cba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inserting new provisions into a proposal at the last minute</a> and <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/02/04/mlb-told-mlbpa-it-wont-provide-counter-offer-lockout-negotiations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusing to make a counterproposal after saying they would</a>. Media coverage of the lockout was also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/03/08/baseball-lockout-media-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more sympathetic to the players</a>, both explicitly and implicitly by highlighting how much wealthier the owners are than the players and how the players’ share of MLB’s revenue has <a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-mlbpa-has-a-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped in recent years</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of whom they blamed, though, fans weren’t happy during the lockout. Forty-six percent told Morning Consult they were “frustrated,” and 75 percent told SurveyMonkey/the Los Angeles Times that they agreed that the main issue in the lockout was “greed, not baseball.” And 60 percent of fans in the SurveyMonkey/Los Angeles Times poll said that the dispute had caused them to lose interest in the 2022 baseball season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You might expect that last number to set off alarm bells in MLB headquarters (and maybe it did — these polls, or at least the sentiments expressed in them, could help explain why a new agreement was signed just a few days later). But later on in the same poll, a plurality of fans also said the lockout probably wouldn’t affect how much time or money they spent on baseball this year. Fifty percent of fans said they would attend about the same number of games that they would have if there hadn’t been a lockout, 49 percent said they would watch about the same number of games, and 47 percent said they would buy about the same amount of merchandise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Granted, a healthy minority of fans — 32 to 36 percent — said they would do these things less because of the lockout, but since the poll was taken while the lockout was still going on, some fans may have assumed that the lockout would cancel a good chunk of the season, if not all of it. (In a separate question, only 59 percent of respondents predicted that the lockout would be resolved by Memorial Day.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even those who assumed baseball would be back quickly may have been using this question to express their displeasure with the dispute. We’ll have to wait until the end of the season to check attendance, viewership and revenue numbers to know for sure, but the smart bet is probably that the lockout won’t significantly harm MLB’s bottom line.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a popular perception that the 1994-95 strike damaged baseball’s standing, but if it did, the effect was temporary. Long-term trends in &lt;a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/misc.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;game attendance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/22240/nearly-half-americans-baseball-fans.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;percentage of Americans calling themselves baseball fans&lt;/a&gt; have been steady. Regardless, of course, there’s a big difference between a strike that canceled &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/nationals/mlb-work-stoppages-history-lockouts-strikes-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;948 games&lt;/a&gt; and a lockout that ultimately canceled none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a> You see, polling questions like this are a honeytrap for political analysts, too. Pollsters routinely ask people whether certain <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/poll-trump-supporters-immigration-2016-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy stances</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/14/poll-biden-black-vp-185043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political decisions</a> or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/data-points/poll-more-voters-say-trump-doesn-t-respect-women-after-n663296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals</a> will make them more or less likely to vote for a politician, but these questions should <a href="https://twitter.com/aedwardslevy/status/1034859763815907335?s=20&amp;t=jZQcrWxF8RwLp2xHQ-UYqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rarely be taken literally</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s because respondents themselves rarely take the question literally, instead using it as an opportunity to register their feelings about the stance, decision, scandal or politician in question. For example, according to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/327007811/NBC-News-SurveyMonkey-Toplines-and-Methodology-10-3-10-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey/NBC News poll</a> from back in 2016, 39 percent of likely voters said that the “Access Hollywood” tape would make them less likely to support Donald Trump for president. But that included 65 percent of Democrats — few of whom ever had any likelihood of supporting Trump anyway. Among Republicans — i.e., a group that <em>was</em> inclined to support Trump before the tape’s release — only 12 percent said the tape made them less likely to support him, while 81 percent said it made no difference. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">An <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2019-12/topline-538-ipsos-impeachment_-wave-2-120419.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos/FiveThirtyEight poll</a> from 2019 illustrates how this can apply to nonelectoral questions, too. In it, 38 percent of Americans said that Trump’s impeachment hearings had made them more likely to believe he committed an impeachable offense; only 20 percent said it made them less likely to believe it. But 95 percent of those who said the hearings made them more likely to believe Trump committed an impeachable offense <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-impeachment-hearings-just-confirmed-voters-preexisting-opinions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>already believed that he had</em></a>. And an identical 95 percent of those who said the hearings made them less likely to believe it <em>already believed that he was innocent</em>.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">These types of questions are really relevant only among the subset of respondents whose minds are genuinely not made up — and even then, you’re putting a lot of trust in them to accurately predict their future behavior. (For instance, Trump did <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dip in the polls</a> after the “Access Hollywood” tape was released — but he recovered a few weeks later, suggesting that voters put aside their misgivings with the tape because they found another reason to vote for Trump.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And sure, maybe MLB fans’ game-watching habits are more malleable than partisans’ political beliefs, but sports fandom can inspire people to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2022/03/12/sports-fans-more-violent-abusive-since-returning-after-worst-covid/6986397001/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do extreme things</a> and <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/sport/fans-judge-cheats-when-it-suits-them-1.544451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twist themselves up in logical knots</a>, just like partisanship. There’s a reason that sports fandom and political fanaticism are <a href="https://www.newswise.com/politics/study-draws-connections-between-sports-fandom-and-political-tribalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often</a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/voters-are-starting-to-act-like-hard-core-sports-fans-with-dangerous-repercussions-for-democracy-153175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Will Smith’s net favorability rating among Americans has fallen by 30 percentage points after he slapped Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards last weekend, according to <a href="https://civicscience.com/majority-of-u-s-adults-side-with-chris-rock/">a March 27 poll from CivicScience</a>. (If you’ve been living under a rock: Smith attacked Rock after Rock <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/oscars-2022-smith-apologizes-acceptance-speech-chris-rock-83712905">made a joke about Smith’s wife</a>, Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia.) CivicScience, which has been tracking Smith’s favorability ratings weekly since 2011, found Smith’s net favorability — the share who have a favorable view of Smith minus the share who have an unfavorable view — dropping from +50 points to +20 points post-slap. Seventy-eight percent of Americans sided with Rock, according to this poll, while 61 percent said in <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2022/03/28/will-smith-was-wrong-hit-chris-rock">a March 28 YouGov poll</a> that what Smith did was wrong.</li><li>The share of Americans supporting Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court seems relatively unchanged by her confirmation hearings, though some Americans may have gone from being undecided to opposing her confirmation. A March 25-27 <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/28/ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmation-support-polling/">poll from Morning Consult/Politico</a> found that 47 percent of registered voters thought that the Senate should vote to confirm Jackson, while a March 26-29 <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/3ixnq9227y/econTabReport.pdf">poll from The Economist/YouGov</a> showed 43 percent support among Americans. Those numbers are similar to Jackson’s support in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-broadly-want-the-senate-to-confirm-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-the-supreme-court/">our analysis of polls conducted prior to the hearings</a>. When compared with their previous polls, the share of respondents who had “no opinion” or were “not sure” dropped by 7 percentage points in both polls. The Morning Consult/Politico poll also found that opposition to Jackson’s confirmation rose by 7 points, but The Economist/YouGov survey found basically no change in opposition.</li><li>Views of American leadership have dramatically improved across almost all NATO countries, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391160/image-improves-across-nato.aspx">a Gallup poll</a> conducted in February but before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Compared to 2020, 26 of the 27 countries polled had a more favorable view of U.S. leadership. The greatest increases came from Portugal (52 percentage points), the Netherlands (45 points) and Norway (42 points). The only country with lower approval of U.S. leadership was Lithuania, where favorability decreased by 6 points.</li><li>A strong majority of Americans (77 percent) supported the CDC’s decision to relax social distancing and face mask guidelines in areas with low rates of COVID-19, according to a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_032822.pdf/">March 10-14 poll</a> from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_032822/">Monmouth University</a>. Additionally, 62 percent thought that face mask and social distancing guidelines should not be instituted in their state currently, while 55 percent opposed requirements to show proof of vaccination to do in-person work. But a majority of Americans seemed fine with changing these guidelines as the situation changes — 50 percent said they preferred for the government to continue adjusting guidelines and mandates, while 34 percent said they wanted no guidelines and 14 percent said they wanted the government to settle on something consistent.</li><li>Americans are growing increasingly concerned about Russia’s nuclear weapons and global influence, according to <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/concerns-about-nuclear-weapons/">a March 17-21 poll from the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a>. Seventy-one percent of Americans said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had increased the likelihood of nuclear weapons being used anywhere in the world, with the majority saying that this made them extremely or very concerned about Ukraine (61 percent) or other European countries (50 percent) being potential targets. Compared with a February poll taken just prior to the invasion, the share of Americans in the more recent poll who were extremely or very concerned that Russia’s influence around the world posed a direct threat to the United States rose 11 percentage points, to 64 percent.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past year, many Republicans have repeatedly claimed that education has run amok under Democratic control and that parents need more say in the classroom. There have been debates over school closures, masking, transgender students competing in school sports, and how teachers talk about race, gender and sexuality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You could say that education has become something of a wedge issue — in other words, an issue that parties use to try to divide the opposing party to shake loose new voters.

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional redistricting</a> — the process of redrawing the nation’s 435 congressional districts to reflect the results of the 2020 census — is not quite finished, but it’s getting darn close. Only four states (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a>) have yet to approve new maps (though the maps in several states are currently being challenged in court, so some states that <em>have</em> approved new maps could see those maps overturned — as happened in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a> just last week).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So while some of the specific numbers will change, we now have a good sense of what the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-countless-confusing-sometimes-contradictory-takeaways-of-the-2021-22-redistricting-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big-picture takeaway</a> from this redistricting cycle will be. No matter which way you slice it, Democrats have gained blue seats from the mapmaking process, making the House playing field between the two parties more balanced than it has been in decades. But that doesn’t mean the 2022 congressional map should be considered “fair.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the maps stand on March 30 at 5 p.m. Eastern, 175 congressional districts have a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan lean</a><a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> of D+5 or bluer, 181 have a partisan lean of R+5 or redder and 33 are in the “highly competitive” category between D+5 and R+5. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1070" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/redistricting-2022-maps-hero-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That’s a net increase of 11 Democratic-leaning seats from the old maps. Meanwhile, the number of Republican-leaning seats has decreased by six, as has the number of highly competitive seats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, that’s just the partisan lean of the districts. To get a sense for how these changes will affect the race for control of the chamber, you need to factor in which party currently controls each seat (not to mention the national political environment, but put that aside for a moment). Still, Democrats are likely to gain seats from redistricting in 2022 even after you consider that they already hold a lot of those newly blue-leaning seats. By my calculations, redistricting alone should net Democrats about two more seats in the House next year,<a data-footnote-id="11" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-11" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I arrived at that number: Between seven and nine Republican-held districts have been redrawn to favor Democrats (two in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, three in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one each in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;), while between six and eight Democratic-held districts have been redrawn to favor Republicans (two in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Georgia,&lt;/a&gt; one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one each in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/kansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a net gain of one seat for Democrats, give or take. But Democrats also gained one seat on net from &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reapportionment&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/oregon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; each added one new blue seat, while &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; each lost one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> while Republicans are in position to lose around three or four seats on net from the process.<a data-footnote-id="12" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-12" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got this number by taking the roughly one seat Republicans are losing to Democrats on net from redistricting (see previous footnote), and combining it with the two or three net seats Republicans have lost in reapportionment: Population trends added one red seat in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/montana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and potentially one in &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, but they also subtracted one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/michigan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and one from &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>12</sup></a> Of course, the national political environment (which is currently <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican-leaning</a>) will have a much bigger impact on the 2022 midterms than redistricting, so this doesn’t mean Democrats are favored to hold onto the House — but it does mean that redistricting made that task slightly more possible.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We also have a good sense for what the new maps will look like in the four states that have yet to enact them;<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; will have two seats that are either very or somewhat competitive; &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; will either have two safely Democratic seats, five safely Republican seats and one competitive Republican seat, or two safely Democratic seats and six safely Republican seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> is the only state that might deviate significantly from the old map. If we add their projected partisan breakdowns on top of the numbers we already have, I estimate that we’ll end up with 220-223 districts that are to the right of the nation as a whole and 212-215 districts that are to the left of the nation as a whole. Pretty evenly split!</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Accordingly, the tipping-point congressional district — the one that theoretically would be the majority-clinching 218th seat for either party — should be historically close. Since 1996, the tipping-point House seat has always had a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+2.7 or redder. In recent years, it’s been closer to R+5 — meaning, in theory, Democrats have to win the national aggregate House vote by roughly 5 or more percentage points to win a majority in the House. Depending on how things shake out in the remaining four states, the tipping-point seat could be anywhere from R+1.0 to R+1.9 in 2022.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="The House's Republican bias will drop dramatically in 2022" aria-label="Bar Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZMa4D/19/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="670" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Note on the chart how the tipping-point seat’s partisan lean lurched rightward in both 2002 and 2012, reflecting Republicans’ gains in redistricting after the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Not only did Democrats break this mini-streak of good redistricting cycles for Republicans, but they also reversed the effects of two pro-GOP redistricting cycles in one fell swoop.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even in Democrats’ worst-case scenario at this point, the House’s long-standing (we’re talking over 50 years) <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bias toward Republicans</a> would drastically diminish. That would certainly be historic — but it wouldn’t mean everything is finally hunky-dory with our congressional maps. Some of this increase in balance is thanks to courts striking down Republican gerrymanders in states such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a>, but Democrats achieved this near-parity mostly through gerrymanders of their own in states such as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois</a>. The result is an overall national map that <em>looks</em> fair but individual state maps that are anything but.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We have metrics to show this. <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Efficiency gap</a> is a statistic that attempts to quantify how efficient a map is at converting votes into seats for a given party. For example, a map with an R+10 efficiency gap would be expected to produce 10 percent more Republican-leaning seats than a fair map would. The <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1946&amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inventors of efficiency gap</a> proposed a test whereby any map that produces two or more extra House seats for a party should be considered an unconstitutional gerrymander. Under the maps in place for the 2022 elections, seven states flunk that test, and several others come close.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">A total of 21 states’ maps are worth at least 0.7 extra House seats to the advantaged party, according to efficiency gap. Of course, in real life, parties can’t win fractions of a seat, but in almost all of those 21 states, it’s possible to draw a map that gives another seat to the disadvantaged party. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennessee</a> dismantled the blue district surrounding Nashville and turned it ruby-red. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/utah/orange_3_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah</a> declined to draw a Salt Lake City-centered district that would have been safely Democratic. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Mexico</a> shifted its only red district 18 points to the left. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> likely cut off Republicans’ chances to unseat three Democratic representatives (Josh Gottheimer, Andy Kim and Mikie Sherrill). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Put bluntly, the national House map still isn't fair; its gerrymanders are just more fairly balanced. And the unfairness of the individual maps has other important consequences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, the new national map is also shaping up to be historically uncompetitive. The number of swing districts has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-swing-districts-dwindle-can-a-divided-house-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the decline for decades</a> thanks to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ending-gerrymandering-wont-fix-what-ails-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factors like ideological self-sorting and increased polarization</a>. But gerrymandering has played a role too: As mentioned above, six highly competitive districts have been drawn out of existence so far this redistricting cycle. And if you take a more generous definition of “competitive,” the decline is even sharper: The number of districts with partisan leans between D+15 and R+15 has dropped by 10 so far.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When the dust settles, the 2022 congressional map could have the fewest swing seats in a generation. Based on our educated guesses of what the eventual maps will look like in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/missouri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-hampshire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Hampshire</a>, between 36 and 42 congressional districts will have partisan leans between D+5 and R+5. In addition, 121-123 districts will have partisan leans between D+15 and R+15 — the fewest since at least 1996.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="The disappearance of competitive districts will continue in 2022" aria-label="Stacked Bars" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GHOmx/13/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="708" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Finally, partisanship isn’t the only way to measure the fairness of congressional maps. As I wrote earlier this month, the new maps <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-this-redistricting-cycle-failed-to-increase-representation-for-people-of-color-and-could-even-set-it-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall short of providing full representation to racial minorities</a>. For example, the population growth that gave Texas two new congressional seats this year was fueled largely by people of color (mostly Latinos), but the two new districts the state drew were both majority-white. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-court-ruling-in-alabama-could-boost-black-political-power-throughout-the-south/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several Southern states</a>, such as Alabama, declined to draw additional districts where Black people are the dominant voting bloc, despite it being easily possible to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As mentioned above, lawsuits may remedy some of these problems, but time is rapidly running out for any changes to be made in time for the 2022 election. So while the book isn’t yet closed on the 2021-22 redistricting cycle, the nation’s new congressional map still has serious flaws that are unlikely to be fixed before voters go to the polls. That said, we’ll keep our redistricting coverage going until the last map is absolutely, positively, 100 percent final, just in case we get a surprise in one of the last four states or an unexpected court ruling. Keep checking our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistricting tracker</a> for the latest updates.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Imagine the federal government could lift millions of American children out of poverty with a single program. That program would help parents put nutritious meals on the table, pay for school expenses and even save for kids’ college — all with no negative impact on the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You don’t have to imagine. We had it just last year … and now we don’t.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/61f946b1cb0bb75fd2ca03ad/1643726515657/Child-Tax-Credit-Research-Roundup-CPSP-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">By nearly every empirical measure</a>, the expanded child tax credit (CTC) — the policy passed in 2021 that gave parents a few hundred dollars per month for each child in their family — was a wild success, dramatically reducing child poverty and making it easier for families to buy food and pay for housing and utilities. In combination with other COVID-19 relief measures, particularly the stimulus payments that went out to Americans in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/first-coronavirus-stimulus-checks-deposited.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 2020</a>, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-and-irs-begin-delivering-second-round-of-economic-impact-payments-to-millions-of-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/third-economic-impact-payment#:~:text=The%20IRS%20started%20sending%20the,and%20related%20plus-up%20payments." target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2021</a>, the CTC helped buffer families against the economic upheaval of the pandemic.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Child poverty fell when the child tax credit was expanded" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sozeP/15/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It’s rare that researchers can say with certainty that a program like the CTC actually worked. Politicians usually consider policies in an abstract, hypothetical way, knowing that a piece of legislation might not accomplish their aims. But by the time Congress was thinking about extending the CTC, there was a mountain of cold, hard data showing that this program did a lot to help children and families. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet that wasn’t enough to save it. The expanded tax credit ended in December 2021, and chances are low it will be renewed. That tells you all you need to know about which is more powerful in Washington — politicians’ biases or actual evidence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">By the time the pandemic hit, reformers had been pushing for years for the U.S. to establish a universal allowance for families with children. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/23/11440638/child-benefit-child-allowance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many other rich countries</a> give some kind of blanket financial support to parents and, not coincidentally, those countries also have <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/these-rich-countries-have-high-levels-of-child-poverty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower rates of child poverty</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it took the ultimate upheaval — a global pandemic — to nudge American lawmakers into action. In the spring of 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/us/politics/child-tax-credit-payments.html?searchResultPosition=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats in Congress transformed</a> the CTC, an anti-poverty measure that’s been <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/child-tax-credit-overview.aspx#:~:text=It%20was%20established%20as%20a,per%20child%20under%20age%2017." target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of the tax code since 1997</a>, into a kind of emergency child allowance. Unlike the original version, which parents received as a single lump sum when they filed their taxes, the expanded CTC was distributed in monthly payments. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/economy/child-tax-credit.html?searchResultPosition=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From July through December of last year</a>, most parents of children under age 6 received $300 per month per child, and most parents of children between the ages of 6 and 17 received $250 per month per child. The new payment was more generous: Families received up to $3,600 per child per year under the expanded CTC, compared to only $2,000 under the original version. And while the original CTC was mostly available to middle-class families, many more parents were eligible under the expanded program.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original CTC was not fully refundable, which meant that families who had little or no income were not eligible for the whole payment. The expanded CTC was refundable and &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/2021-child-tax-credit-and-advance-child-tax-credit-payments-topic-c-calculation-of-the-2021-child-tax-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;started to phase out&lt;/a&gt; once adjusted gross income reached $75,000 for individual filers, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples who filed jointly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Government programs are often glitchy when they start, but the fact that most families were eligible for the payments meant that they were fairly easy to administer. The IRS already had all the information it needed for anyone who had claimed children on their previous year’s taxes — no additional applications or forms to fill out. The payments <a href="https://www.vox.com/22588701/child-tax-credit-accessibility-irs-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went straight into recipients’ bank accounts</a> or they got a check in the mail, with minimal fuss.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the money helped — a lot. Beginning July 15, the vast majority (88 percent) of families with children <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/child-tax-credit-overview.aspx#:~:text=Beginning%20July%2015%2C%202021%2C%2088,31%2C%202021." target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a payment</a> of either $300 or $250 per child. Researchers at the Columbia University Center on Poverty and Social Policy found that the July payment <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/monthly-poverty-july-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept around 3 million children out of poverty.</a> At the end of 2021, <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/montly-poverty-december-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the researchers estimated</a> that the program was keeping 3.7 million children out of poverty. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Families were living in very precarious economic circumstances,” said <a href="https://columbia.academia.edu/MeganCurran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Megan Curran</a>, one of the researchers on the Columbia team. “That $300 or $600 per month — it might not sound like much, but when you’re making very little, it can be enough to give you a financial cushion.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reduction in child poverty was the big, headline-making finding. But the payments helped in other ways, too. <a href="https://rapidsurveyproject.com/our-research/child-tax-credit-is-buffering-families-from-hardship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple</a> <a href="https://socialpolicyinstitute.wustl.edu/how-families-use-ctc-payments-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> found that most parents spent the money on essential things like food, rent and bills.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Low-income parents were especially likely to spend the money on basic needs. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788110#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20the%20first,than%20ultimately%20will%20receive%20it." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/economic-hardship-declined-in-households-with-children-as-child-tax-credit-payments-arrived.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that once the money started arriving, fewer families reported that they didn’t have enough to eat. “The most commonly reported expenditure was food,” Curran said. “After that, it was essential bills — these very basic things that households need.” But the money came in handy for other things, too. When the beginning of the school year rolled around, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/10/nearly-a-third-of-parents-spent-child-tax-credit-on-school-expenses.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%2010%20households,on%20rent%2C%20mortgage%20or%20utilities." target="_blank" rel="noopener">about one-third of parents</a> who received a CTC payment spent at least some of it on school supplies. Another study found that most parents planned to <a href="https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&amp;context=spi_research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save some of the money</a> for a rainy day. Some said they would spend the money on tutors for their children — perhaps helping to offset some of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-has-left-millions-of-students-behind-now-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the learning loss</a> caused by over a year of school disruptions. The payments helped some families <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/child-tax-credit-payment-pay-off-debt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig themselves out of debt</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/14/22826684/build-back-better-child-tax-credit-expires-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escape eviction</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The findings were especially striking because there were no strings attached to the money. Parents could spend the payments however they liked. And despite politicians’ <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2011/03/15/ebt-welfare-restrictions-spendings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longstanding suspicion</a> that if we simply gave people money, they’d <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2012/7/9/20504264/new-state-laws-ban-drinking-smoking-gambling-on-government-s-dime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run out to buy drugs or cigarettes</a>, families were overwhelmingly likely to spend it in ways that directly benefited their children.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, it was possible that the expanded payments had drawbacks, too. For years, some economists had been concerned that a child allowance for all families — whether the parents had a job or not — would give some people a reason not to work. <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2021-115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study published</a> a few months after the CTC expansion estimated that the move would prompt 1.5 million workers to quit their jobs and leave the labor force, canceling out some of the payments’ benefits. In an October opinion column, two co-authors of the study argued that based on their findings, extending the expanded CTC <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/14/press-pause-rush-extend-child-tax-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would do more harm than good</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t seem to be what happened. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When other economists looked</a> at real life data from when the monthly payments were going out, they found that only a small share of parents said they left their jobs. And those people were balanced out by another group of parents who started working after the expanded CTC went into effect — perhaps because they suddenly had enough money to pay for child care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Researchers sliced and diced the data, looking for any negative effect on the economy. It wasn’t there. “​​Any way that we cut it, we just don’t see an impact on whether parents work,” said <a href="https://economics.barnard.edu/profiles/elizabeth-ananat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Ananat</a>, an economics professor at Barnard College and a co-author of one of the studies. “And that’s in contrast with all the work on poverty and material hardship where we see huge, huge effects.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the evidence didn’t seem compelling to the one person who controlled the expanded CTC’s fate: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. By the fall of 2021, when Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/11/child-tax-credit-climate-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were pondering a renewal of the payments</a> as part of a sprawling social policy bill, it was clear that it wasn’t going to get bipartisan support. That meant if one moderate Democrat defected, the expanded payments would expire at the end of the year. Manchin thought the payments were too broad. He didn’t think parents should be eligible <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/manchin-wont-support-enhanced-child-tax-credit-without-work-requirement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unless they had a job</a>, and he wanted a much lower income cap for parents to qualify. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a certain logic to his reasoning — the payments shouldn’t discourage people from working, and it should only go to the neediest families. But experts told me that these changes wouldn’t actually translate into money better spent. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.22324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A complicated formula</a> for determining eligibility can keep the people who most need the money from getting it. And aside from the fact that parents weren’t leaving their jobs because of the payments, work requirements may be counterproductive. “It’s the equivalent of kicking someone when they’re down,” Ananat said. “You might have a sick kid and have to stay home for a day and lose your job. Then you can’t pay for child care to go out and interview for a bunch of new jobs.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Manchin didn’t agree. By the end of 2021, he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-privately-raised-concerns-parents-would-use-child-tax-credit-n1286321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly told other senators</a> that without strict limitations, parents would spend the money on drugs — despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. The Democrats’ social policy bill <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/19/1065636709/joe-manchin-says-he-cannot-support-bidens-build-back-better-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died in the Senate in December</a>, and the last round of the expanded payments went out to families that same month, with no sign of a renewal in sight.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The impact of losing the money was as dramatic as gaining it. In January and February, families with children <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/02/harder-to-pay-bills-now-that-child-tax-credit-payments-have-ended.html?utm_campaign=20220228msacos1ccstors&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were more likely to say</a> they were struggling to cover household expenses. Child poverty rose. Parents <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/politics/child-tax-credit-child-poverty/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported struggling</a> to pay for diapers and child care. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/09/expanded-child-tax-credit-expiration-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted in February found that 75 percent of people who had benefited from the expanded CTC said that losing the money would affect their financial security.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, researchers like Ananat were left standing in frustration on the sidelines, wondering how such a successful program had gone up in smoke. “The thing that’s so heartbreaking to me is that we were able to actually find out what the policy did,” Ananat said. “And now we have an answer. It just helps kids. That’s all it does. And then they just let it go.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the wake of Russia’s invasion, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60555472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions of refugees</a> are fleeing Ukraine. Support for these refugees is currently very high: Recent polls have found residents of other European countries <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/europes-unified-ukrainian-refugees-exposes-double-standard-nonwhite/story?id=83251970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly support</a> taking in Ukrainian refugees, including 77 percent in <a href="https://news.err.ee/1608523322/poll-estonian-support-high-for-taking-in-ukrainian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estonia</a>, 80 percent <a href="https://yes-ukraine.org/2022/European_peoples_behind_Ukraine-EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in France</a>, 85 percent <a href="https://www.puls24.at/news/chronik/umfrage-grosse-mehrheit-fuer-aufnahme-von-ukraine-fluechtlingen/259109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Austria</a>, 89 percent in Italy and 90 percent in Germany. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This level of support is different from the last sudden influx of refugees in Europe in 2015, when <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/08/02/number-of-refugees-to-europe-surges-to-record-1-3-million-in-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.3 million people</a> from several Middle Eastern and African countries sought asylum in Europe, many fleeing the Syrian civil war. In that instance, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/10/europe/denmark-refugees-ukraine-syrian-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public support for refugees was much</a> lower. For example, 27 percent of Brits said <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2015/09/07/0d080/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a 2015 poll</a> that they didn’t think the U.K. should accept any Syrian refugees, while a recent poll from early March shows <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/03/02/support-taking-ukraine-refugees-rises-76" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 11 percent</a> saying the same about Ukrainians. In Poland, support for accepting Ukrainian refugees is <a href="https://yes-ukraine.org/2022/European_peoples_behind_Ukraine-EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 90 percent now</a>, which stands in stark contrast to where the country has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/politics-nationalism-and-religion-explain-why-poland-doesnt-want-refugees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically stood</a> on the question of whether to accept refugees. Even <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/three-quarters-americans-support-us-taking-ukrainian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74 percent of Americans</a> say they support accepting Ukrainian refugees, although Americans have long been <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/186866/americans-again-opposed-taking-refugees.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reluctant to accept refugees</a> from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/u-s-public-seldom-has-welcomed-refugees-into-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various international conflicts</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/03/1084201542/ukraine-refugees-racism?t=1647018458791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racism and anti-Muslim sentiments</a> explain, at least in part, why many Europeans were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/arab-refugees-see-double-standards-europes-embrace-ukrainians-2022-03-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less willing to accept refugees</a> from Arab and predominantly Muslim countries, as studies have found that race and religion are very important in determining which refugees are accepted versus which refugees are turned away. But public opinion toward Syrian refugees also <a href="https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/refugees-welcome-cross-european-public-opinion-on-asylum-seekers-following-the-2015-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ebbed and flowed</a> in Europe, with some countries initially very supportive. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, that trajectory is not uncommon in humanitarian crises: Support for refugees can start relatively high in the immediate aftermath of a disaster to only crater as <a href="https://mathildeemeriau.com/files/shipwrecks.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news cycles change</a>, anecdotal accounts of difficulties emerge and sympathies move on. It’s one reason why support for Ukrainian refugees may ultimately prove to be short-lived, too.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is one point in <a href="https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/docs/findings/ESS7_toplines_issue_7_immigration.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the scientific literature</a> on <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Key-Findings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion</a> toward <a href="https://mathildeemeriau.com/files/learningtobeunbiased.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asylum seekers</a> that is <a href="https://www.hangartner.net/files/passportapsr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite clear</a>, however: Not all refugees are welcome.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though there are &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;legal distinctions&lt;/a&gt; between refugees and asylum seekers in some places, the terms are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK379415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;often used interchangeably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>15</sup></a>  In a huge, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18,000-person, 15-country European survey</a>, political scientists Kirk Bansak, Jens Hainmueller and Dominik Hangartner found a number of characteristics ranging from refugees’ religion to their ability to speak the language that made people less — or more — willing to accept them.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Hangartner’s Immigration Policy Lab in Zurich, although I am working on a separate project involving online hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In particular, Bansak, Hainmueller and Hangartner found that people were 11 percentage points less likely to say they would accept a Muslim refugee than a Christian one. They also found people were less willing to accept men seeking asylum than women. How “deserving” people thought refugees were also played a role, with refugees seeking asylum for economic opportunity being far less accepted than victims of political, religious or ethnic persecution. Victims of torture were also more likely to be accepted, as were asylum seekers without inconsistencies in their stories. You can see in the chart below all the different metrics Bansak, Hainmueller and Hangartner asked about, and how that affected support for refugees.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Europeans don't welcome all asylum seekers equally" aria-label="Dot Plot" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/V96Uo/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="1419" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">And at least a couple of these factors help us better understand why support for Ukrainian refugees is so high. First and foremost, Ukrainian refugees are likely perceived to share a great cultural similarity with other Europeans, particularly because they are largely white and Christian. Indeed, non-white people fleeing Ukraine have faced <a href="https://time.com/6153276/ukraine-refugees-racism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much bigger obstacles</a>. The gender breakdown of Ukrainian refugees is also just very different from the wave of refugees who arrived in Europe in 2015. <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/american-stuck-ukraine-because-ban-military-age-men-leaving-country-1690506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Men under the age of 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine</a>, which has meant the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees are women and children.  In 2015,  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/08/02/4-asylum-seeker-demography-young-and-male/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54 percent</a> of asylum seekers were men, 17 percent were women and 29 percent were children, in part because the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/01/female-refugees-face-physical-assault-exploitation-and-sexual-harassment-on-their-journey-through-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journey, often from the Middle East to Europe, was longer and more dangerous</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ukrainian refugees’ perceived “deservingness” is also especially clear: With <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/opinion/letters/ukraine-russia-war.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphic images</a> of Russian violence dominating the media and European public opinion <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-favor-defense-ukraine-diplomacy-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly</a> on the <a href="https://yes-ukraine.org/2022/European_peoples_behind_Ukraine-EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side of Ukraine</a>, many Europeans are sympathetic to Ukrainian refugees. Bansak, a <a href="https://polisci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/currently-active-faculty/bansak-profile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professor at the University of California, San Diego</a>, told me that another component at play here could be a sense of European solidarity with Ukraine against Russian aggression. Russia’s invasion is seen as a more direct threat in Europe than the Syrian civil war. Hangartner, another of the study’s authors, stressed the perceived cultural similarity, plus the fact that most refugees are women and children, was driving solidarity. Public opinion in Europe, Hangartner told me, is just more favorable toward the typical Ukrainian refugee profile — which tends to be, at this point, Christian and female.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But research has also found that how people feel toward refugees often changes, especially as time wears on. This may in part be because people start worrying that refugees may be an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/07/11/europeans-fear-wave-of-refugees-will-mean-more-terrorism-fewer-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic burden</a>, though there <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1965139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is evidence</a> that even <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/does-exposure-to-the-refugee-crisis-make-natives-more-hostile/3E66D9B39336C652F9EF6D7EF9DF0735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refugees’ mere presence in a country can cause a backlash</a>, suggesting that support for Ukrainian refugees may go down as they look to different countries for shelter. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Once again, what happened when hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq sought asylum in Europe may be instructive here. When the number of refugees arriving via the Mediterranean Sea first <a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/MonthlyTrendsofNationalities-ArrivalstoGreeceItalyandSpain-31December2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rose sharply in August and September</a> of 2015, public opinion in many, particularly western, European countries initially <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268119300381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded positively</a> to <a href="https://rm.coe.int/1680706b00" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media coverage</a>, with many Europeans saying they’d welcome refugees. For example, after photos of Alan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned while crossing the Mediterranean, received <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/03/437336063/image-of-dead-syrian-child-shakes-up-media-coverage-of-refugee-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy coverage in traditional</a> and <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/aylan-kurdi-social-media-report-1.533951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a>, France saw a <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/les-francais-desormais-majoritairement-pour-l-accueil-des-migrants-selon-un-sondage_1714168.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9-point swing toward accepting refugees</a> in the span of a week, while the number of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1613977114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily donations to a Red Cross refugee fund in Sweden briefly increased over 100-fold</a>. In Germany and Austria, cheering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/05/refugee-crisis-warm-welcome-for-people-bussed-from-budapest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crowds welcomed refugees</a> at train stations, while tens of thousands <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/12/refugees-welcome-uk-marchers-un-warns-war-syria-million-displaced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marched in support in Britain</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But this effect was short-lived, and public sentiment soon shifted. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-poll-notes-rise-in-fears-over-refugee-influx/a-18757023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A German poll</a> found in September that <a href="https://www.infratest-dimap.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dt1509_bericht.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 percent</a> of respondents were worried by the number of refugees arriving, but by October, that number had risen to <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend-409.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">51 percent</a>. By 2016, Germans were <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/poll-germans-increasingly-skeptical-of-refugees/a-18982943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even less supportive</a> of refugees. In the U.K., meanwhile, 60 percent of respondents said <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/11/18/brits-less-accepting-syrian-refugees-wake-paris-at" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in September</a> that they thought the country should admit similar or higher numbers of Syrian refugees than it had previously, but by November, that had dropped to 44 percent. Ultimately European countries did accept many refugees — over <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/cy/2021/03/18/syria-refugee-crisis-globally-in-europe-and-in-cyprus-meet-some-syrian-refugees-in-cyprus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 million from Syria alone</a>, 59 percent of whom were taken in by Germany — though many were turned away, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/world/asia/migration-eu-poland-belarus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue to be</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So while there are a number of reasons why Ukrainian refugees are being broadly accepted at this point, there’s no guarantee that will continue to be true, especially if history is any indication.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One instructive example might be what happened during the Soviet Union’s invasion of Hungary in 1956. As Soviet tanks entered Budapest after days of demonstrations, around <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/editorial/2006/10/452665e92/refugees-magazine-issue-144-hungarian-refugees-50-years-editorial-50th.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">180,000 Hungarians fled to Austria</a>. As the Ukrainians do today, they had many of the hallmarks of refugees that would be welcomed — they shared a skin tone and a religion with Austrians and the source of their persecution was evident. Not to mention, Hungary not only shares a border with Austria, but was in fact part of the same country less than 40 years prior. But similar to what happened to refugees in 2015, <a href="https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000022018004/ungarn-1956-von-armen-fluechtlingen-zu-parasiten-des-wohlstands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial supportiveness toward Hungarian refugees soon gave way to dislike</a>, and Austria ended up urging other countries to accept over 90 percent of those fleeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s why the welcome Ukrainian refugees receive in many parts of Europe may ultimately prove short-lived. Bansak told me that he would expect people’s attitudes toward Ukrainian refugees to be very positive now — but he’s not convinced they’ll stay that way. “[P]eople in different countries have shown a very, very common propensity to get worn out by things,” Bansak said. A year from now, he said, attitudes toward Ukrainian refugees may look very different than they do now.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">After the disastrous Iowa caucuses in 2020 and years of grumbling before that, the Democratic National Committee entertained a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-nevada-voted-first-in-the-democratic-presidential-primaries-or-new-jersey-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draft proposal</a> that would shake up which states vote first on the presidential primary calendar. Ultimately, the proposal wasn’t considered at the DNC’s meeting in March, but the conversation isn’t going away. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew debates which states should vote first. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">They also look at a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/politics-television-realistic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new survey</a> suggesting that most Americans think “The West Wing” and other political TV shows accurately reflect how politics works. And FiveThirtyEight contributor Laura Bronner joins to discuss where public opinion stands on accepting Ukrainian refugees after the White House announced last week that the U.S. would admit up to 100,000.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By any measure, the past two years have been rough. This month, we marked the two-year anniversary of the nation’s first shutdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19. The coronavirus pandemic has caused <a href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 6 million global deaths</a> since its beginning, including <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly a million in the United States</a>, and continues to kill <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of people</a> in this country every day. As a nation, we have yet to fully reckon with the sheer scale of the loss. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even before the virus arrived, though, there was political strife in the United States. The pandemic hit at the tail end of five tumultuous and divisive years that saw former President Donald Trump’s arrival on the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2021/01/29/how-america-changed-during-donald-trumps-presidency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national political stage and his first presidential term</a>. The pandemic persisted through his reelection campaign against now-President Joe Biden and then Trump’s failed attempt to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2022/01/06/1070610129/photos-one-year-later-a-look-back-on-the-jan-6-insurrection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn the results when he lost</a>. All of this helped shine a spotlight on the racist systems, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police violence</a>, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/anti-immigrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xenophobia</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/business/economy/coronavirus-pandemic-income-inequality.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income</a> and <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/december/has-wealth-inequality-changed-over-time-key-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealth</a> inequalities that had long made life in the United States more difficult for Black Americans, new immigrants and low-income families. In many cases, these forces are now getting worse.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The economic fallout from the pandemic and attendant shutdowns and disruptions has widened a divide between <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-pandemic-hurt-low-wage-workers-the-most-and-so-far-the-recovery-has-helped-them-the-least/#:~:text=Many%20low-wage%20jobs%2C%20such,risk%20of%20contracting%20COVID-19." target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-wage workers</a> — who have been forced to keep working in person, leaving them vulnerable to the virus and <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-2020-employment-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial troubles</a> — and high-wage workers. Behind all of this, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/02/1033054816/our-future-on-a-hotter-planet-means-more-climate-disasters-happening-simultaneou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> has caused more flooding in Gulf Coast states, wildfires in the West and other problems worldwide. Now, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine feels even more destabilizing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So given all of this, how are Americans doing?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The answer is, surprisingly, kind of OK. People in general are resilient and optimistic and can find ways to thrive even in the worst of times. But that doesn’t mean that Americans are optimistic about the direction of the country. This was hinted at in a January Gallup poll in which <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a full 85 percent</a> of respondents said they were satisfied with their own lives, while only 17 percent were satisfied with the direction of the country. That disconnect, though, isn’t unusual. Since Gallup began asking that question in the 1980s, the share of Americans who say they’re “somewhat” or “very” satisfied with their personal lives has been fairly stable, ranging anywhere from 73 percent to 90 percent, while satisfaction in the direction of the country has generally been lower and less stable.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Americans rate their lives better than the country's direction" aria-label="Interactive line chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NWC1d/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Inside this vast divide, I found deeper issues, both in the ways we think about well-being and also in the true state of American lives, through conversations with seven therapists and clinical psychologists. The clinicians I spoke with were part of a larger group of 1,320 that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/16/well/mental-health-crisis-america-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in a November 2021 survey</a> from The New York Times and Psychology Today about what they’d seen in their practices. I also spoke to an expert on <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global happiness</a> and looked at global measures of other <a href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/349280/gallup-global-emotions-report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I believe the human capacity to adapt is beautiful,” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/leah-seeger-minneapolis-mn/331591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leah Seeger</a>, a marriage and family therapist based in Minneapolis. “Even though things are hard, people always adapt to their circumstances.” But at the same time, <a href="http://sociology.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/keyes-corey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corey Lee M. Keyes</a>, a sociologist at Emory University who has long studied the concepts of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12096700/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">languishing and flourishing</a> to better describe how mental health often falls on a spectrum, sounded a note of caution in our email correspondence: “Humans can adapt and get used to things and can lower standards and aspirations to feel good,” he wrote. But “[a]dapting to things was meant to be a short term thing, not long term.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png" alt="" width="268" height="100" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png?w=268 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AMERICANS-UNHAPPY_Rule.png?w=536 2x"></figure></div>



<p data-paragraph="main">The therapists I spoke with told me that at the beginning of the pandemic, in the spring of 2020, they first worked to help clients stabilize their lives, during what was meant to be a brief lockdown, to prevent the virus from spreading while the nation developed the tools to fight it. But as the pandemic dragged on, and schools, businesses and families had to find ways to operate while keeping people safe, a collective strain began to show up in different ways. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, it has also become an intensely personal experience for many. More than two years in, people continue to report higher levels of <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2022/march-2022-survival-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a> after the number of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/well/mind/therapy-appointments-shortages-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking mental health care in the U.S.</a> surged during the first year of the pandemic compared to 2019. The therapists I spoke with said they still have more demand than they can meet. Last year, Gallup reported that 2020 <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/352205/2020-sets-records-negative-emotions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set a record for negative emotions</a> worldwide.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pollster creates the index based on an annual survey of adults from over 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a>  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the pandemic also showed us how volatile swings in emotion could be. <a href="https://www.gallup.com/175196/gallup-healthways-index-methodology.aspx#:~:text=Gallup%20and%20Sharecare%20in%202012,to%20measure%20well-being%20worldwide." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup’s tracking of well-being</a> has followed the relative ups and downs of the pandemic closely, showing a record low in April 2020, near the beginning of the pandemic, when only <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388682/life-ratings-retreat-close-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 percent</a> of respondents reported themselves as “thriving.” The share of those who said they were thriving stayed low, too, as unemployment claims and the daily death toll rose in 2020. But then the numbers began to creep up again as vaccines became available and the economy began reopening by the end of 2020. The thriving group rose to a 14-year high <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388682/life-ratings-retreat-close-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the first half</a> of 2021, when it looked like the pandemic may end. But then, of course, the delta variant arrived in another deadly wave, and the number of Americans who said they were thriving dropped once again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other signs that Americans are struggling have emerged. For instance, there’s been an increase in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2021/20211117.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug overdose deaths</a>, which were already alarmingly high pre-pandemic. The U.S. also has <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a relatively low life expectancy</a>, which impacts overall well-being, compared to other wealthy countries. The murder rate has also risen sharply, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/upshot/murder-rise-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiking around 30 percent</a> from 2019 to 2020, although it remains relatively low compared to the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s. “I would make the argument that these are symptoms of a sick society,” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/david-goldberg-birmingham-al/32235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Goldberg</a>, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The sickness is also apparent in Americans’ divided assessment of the country’s structural racism and how to address it. Officer Derek Chauvin’s <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/crime-law-and-justice/killing-of-george-floyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">murder of George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/invisible-black-women-death-race-gender-disadvantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police shooting of Breonna Taylor</a> in Louisville sparked a widespread Black Lives Matter movement for racial justice in 2020, and later that year we saw the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to hold the office. In 2022, meanwhile, President Biden nominated the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose confirmation hearings were <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/3/22/22991834/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson-republican-josh-hawley-ted-cruz-child-pornography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full of nasty attacks on her record</a>, ranging from racist dog whistles to QAnon conspiracy theories. As my colleague Alex Samuels and FiveThirtyEight contributor Neil Lewis Jr. recently wrote, these steps toward racial justice <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-white-victimhood-fuels-republican-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have often caused a backlash from white Americans</a>, especially white Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The pandemic also coincided with a rise in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-Asian and anti-Asian American violence</a>. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/pooja-sharma-berkeley-ca/466634" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pooja Sharma</a>, a clinical psychologist in Berkeley, California, who sees many patients of Asian and South Asian descent, said that has weighed heavily on many of her clients. “They’re just feeling like, ‘We just don’t know where we fit in,’” she said. “It feels like the world is a heavy place.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While these issues existed before the pandemic, it can feel as though the pandemic has exacerbated them. “We have this Republican and Democrat divide,” Goldberg said. “We have the poor and rich divide, and it seems like we now increasingly have this divide between those who are healthy and those who are immunocompromised,” he said. “I’ve got several patients who are immunocompromised, and they feel terribly betrayed and alone,” by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/03/01/us/mask-mandates-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the relaxing of mitigation measures</a> like mask mandates.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The disruptions themselves weren’t all bad for Americans’ happiness. Many of the therapists I spoke with said that people who were forced to stay at home had no choice but to face what was already going wrong with their lives, which may have led to an opportunity for personal growth for some. “What happened is that the pandemic was like this big magnifying glass,” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/gabriela-sehinkman-beachwood-oh/339530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabriela Sehinkman</a>, a clinical social worker in Ohio. Some of the signs of distress — seeking therapy, getting a divorce, <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/the-great-resignation-or-the-great-rethink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quitting a job</a> — might be people finally dealing with long-simmering problems rather than just struggling through the day. “It forced us to really recalibrate priorities,” she said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For that to happen, though, people need resources to change their lives, like access to therapy or the financial security to seek a new job. Seeger said happiness is a higher-order pursuit: If people are struggling to maintain their housing, suffering from food insecurity or have lost income, then they can’t seek happiness. Indeed, many Americans haven’t had the chance for that reassessment, as they’ve had to keep reporting to work at grocery stores or health care facilities as per usual. The effects of the pandemic <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were distributed unequally</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Happiness Report</a>, a yearly report published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network that gets much of its data from the Gallup World Poll, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2016/HR-V1Ch2_web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in 2016</a> that countries with high levels of income,wealth and well-being inequality also had lower levels of overall happiness overall. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the most important resources to securing happiness, though, is a sense of community, according to John Helliwell, an author of this year’s report. And the U.S. <a href="https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/Appendix_1_StatiscalAppendix_Ch2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does worse</a> on this metric than the happiest countries: American respondents ranked 25th out of 146 countries when it came to the share who said they could rely on someone in times of trouble and 98th on the level of perceived corruption in their government and business institutions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Helliwell told me that the countries that rank highly overall score well on every measure they ask about, but that a lack of social support networks, lack of trust in each other and lack of trust in institutions is important in determining overall happiness scores. Social trust, though, was declining in the U.S. even before the pandemic, and Americans told <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pew Research Center in 2018</a> that declining trust in government and in each other was making it harder to solve many of the country’s problems.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Each year, the World Happiness Report ranks countries according to answers from Gallup's World Poll. The United States ranks well below many <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/happiness-benevolence-and-trust-during-covid-19-and-beyond/#ranking-of-happiness-2019-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European countries</a> and just below Canada, where Helliwell lives. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Focusing on individual well-being instead of rebuilding trust in communities and institutions is very American, Helliwell said. “It turns out that if people are doing something just to make themselves happy, it won’t,” he said. “What really makes you happy is doing the right thing and helping others.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of the therapists I spoke to echoed the idea that Americans have been too siloed in their lives and missing a sense of community belonging, especially during the past two years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There is this really deep messaging in our country … around, ‘I should be happy alone. I should be happy on my own. And If I’m not happy on my own, I need to do more work to be able to be happy on my own,’” said <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/emily-fasten-san-francisco-ca/207058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Fasten</a>, a marriage and family therapist in San Francisco. “And I challenge that, because I do think we need our relationships, and cultivating relationships is a very satisfying aspect of life.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When taken to the extreme, this emphasis on the individual can lead to a sense of social isolation, alienation and loneliness. FiveThirtyEight contributor Daniel Cox, a research fellow for polling and public opinion at the American Enterprise Institute, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-social-alienation-among-some-trump-supporters-help-explain-why-polls-underestimated-trump-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has found that many Americans increasingly feel socially isolated</a>. Before the 2020 election, 17 percent of Americans said they had no one they were close with, a 9-point increase from a similar poll in 2013. Cox wrote that social isolation is linked with distrust in social institutions and democratic processes. This likely complicated our national response to the pandemic; according to Helliwell and other authors of the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/happiness-trust-and-deaths-under-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 World Happiness Report</a>, a countries with less trust in social institutions tended to have higher death rates from the coronavirus; the institutional failure to protect people from death and illness fed into further distrust, creating a vicious cycle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this way, the direction of the country and the satisfaction of our personal lives has become intertwined. “How someone’s individual life is going, it’s always tempered, at least in my clients, by the sort of anxiety or fear of what the future is going to look like and what’s going to be possible,” Fasten said. “And that is definitely influencing people’s ability to be happy and make choices.” </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">The confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson are now over. And they were incredibly ugly.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In advance of the hearings, my colleague Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-racism-and-sexism-could-define-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote that Jackson’s identity as a Black woman</a> as well as her professional background as a former public defender meant that it was likely she’d be subjected to more questions regarding her qualifications than another nominee would be. And sure enough, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee wasted little time grilling Jackson — often in ways that suggested women and people of color are less qualified than their white counterparts, or that their race makes them inherently biased against white people.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There were attacks both <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ketanji-brown-jackson-georgetown-day_n_623a04c6e4b0c727d484145b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inside</a> — and <a href="https://theweek.com/supreme-court/1011637/gop-tweet-linking-ketanji-brown-jackson-with-critical-race-theory-draws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside</a> — of the hearings that tried to paint Jackson as a supporter of critical race theory, a legal framework for understanding systemic racism that the GOP has co-opted as a catch-all term for anything related to race. Her judicial record in cases involving child pornography was also heavily scrutinized, even though there is no evidence that she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/us/politics/judge-jackson-child-sexual-abuse-fact-check.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncommonly soft</a> in her sentences.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We don’t know yet whether the hearings will dramatically alter Americans’ support of Jackson, but at this point, many Americans support her confirmation. Per a March 1-18 poll from Gallup, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/390956/supreme-court-nominee-jackson-support-tied-highest.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58 percent of Americans said</a> the Senate should vote to confirm Jackson, versus 30 percent who thought she should not be confirmed and 12 percent who had no opinion. Notably, that’s the second-highest level of support that Gallup has recorded for a Supreme Court nominee dating back to Robert Bork’s nomination in 1987.<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four nominees for whom Gallup didn’t collect data: Stephen Breyer, Douglas Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a> Only Chief Justice John Roberts scored higher than Jackson, and only <em>slightly</em> higher — 59 percent of Americans said they supported his nomination in 2005.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For weeks now, anywhere from a plurality to a majority of Americans have said that they support confirming Jackson. No polls have been conducted entirely after the start of the confirmation hearings — but nine different polls have found plurality support for Jackson’s confirmation since Jackson was announced as the nominee<a data-footnote-id="19" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-19" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes a Mar. 19-22 poll &lt;a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/l8ynsbxwgl/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from The Economist/YouGov&lt;/a&gt;, a March 18-21 poll &lt;a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/21121154/2203138_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;, a March 17-20 poll &lt;a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/02ak9bdo3h/tabs_Supreme_Court_Hearing_20220317.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from YouGov&lt;/a&gt;, a March 11-14 poll &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017f-9039-d4fc-a1ff-bebff8c90004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;, a March 7-13 poll &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/17/more-support-than-oppose-jacksons-supreme-court-nomination-with-many-not-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, a March 4-6 poll &lt;a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/08161506/2203034_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;, a Feb. 26-March 1 poll &lt;a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_DailyKos_monthly_banner_book_2022_02_ce91w4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Civiqs&lt;/a&gt;, a Feb. 26-March 1 poll &lt;a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/aa58ig9d3b/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from The Economist/YouGov&lt;/a&gt; and a Feb. 25-27 poll &lt;a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/28114405/2202168_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from Morning Consult/Politico&lt;/a&gt;.

<p data-paragraph="main">But while Jackson has enjoyed majority support in many polls, there’s likely a ceiling to her approval since political polarization has made the process of selecting Supreme Court justices <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-harder-than-ever-to-confirm-a-supreme-court-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more contentious</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Support for Jackson’s nomination among Democrats has been particularly high, sometimes clocking upward 70 percent in the polls we looked at, but Republicans’ views have been much more divided. For instance, Morning Consult/Politico found in late February that <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/22/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-confirmation-hearing-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 percent of Republicans thought</a> that the Senate should confirm Jackson, while 30 percent opposed her nomination. But across three subsequent polls in March, support was lower among Republicans and opposition was higher, hovering in the mid-to-high 30s. Polls from The Economist/YouGov, dating from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/aa58ig9d3b/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feb. 26-March 1</a> and <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/l8ynsbxwgl/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 19-22</a>, found a similar trend — but with greater levels of opposition among Republicans. In the earlier poll, 45 percent opposed confirming Jackson, but this figure grew to 52 percent in the later poll. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent Supreme Court nominees haven’t received the same level of support they once did from Congress, either. Of the seven justices confirmed since Stephen Breyer, only Roberts has received more than 69 percent of the Senate voting in favor of confirmation. He is also the only justice among those seven to have earned the backing of a majority of the other party’s senators.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/595822-the-three-republicans-who-voted-to-confirm-brown-jackson-for-appeals-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Republican senators backed Jackson’s nomination</a> to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last year, but as evidenced by the tenor of this week’s hearings, there’s little chance Jackson garners more — or even the same level of — Republican support this time around.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If confirmed, Jackson would be the first Black female Supreme Court justice, and as such, many Americans think her nomination is historic. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/17/more-support-than-oppose-jacksons-supreme-court-nomination-with-many-not-sure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A March 7-13 poll</a> from the Pew Research Center found that 66 percent of Americans thought Jackson’s nomination was at least somewhat important. And <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_032122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a March 10-14 poll</a> from Monmouth University found that 53 percent of Americans approved of Biden prioritizing the nomination of a Black woman. But one Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/bidens-promise-to-nominate-a-black-woman-to-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll from Feb. 18-21</a>, which predates Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/kbj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination</a> of Jackson, found lower levels of support for his promise to appoint a Black woman. Fifty-two percent of Americans said it was at least somewhat important to them that a Black woman become a Supreme Court justice, while 48 percent said it was not very or not at all important to them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Black Americans, Jackson’s nomination has been especially important. For instance, that Pew survey found that 90 percent of Black adults said having a Black woman on the Supreme Court would be at least somewhat important to them, compared with 66 percent of adults overall. And even though the AP/NORC poll found that a smaller share of Americans thought it was important a Black woman be nominated to the court, 85 percent of Black Americans said in that poll that it was at least somewhat important to them. But as my colleague Alex Samuels wrote earlier this week, this is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ketanji-brown-jacksons-nomination-may-not-be-enough-to-turn-out-black-voters-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely not enough to substantially improve Black voter turnout</a> or Democrats’ prospects in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the hearings now over, we now wait for Jackson’s confirmation vote. Given that the Senate almost surely won’t vote within the next week, there’s still plenty of time for public opinion to change around Jackson, especially as clips from the hearings make the rounds on social media and television. At this point, though, Jackson still benefits from having the support of many Americans, and opposition to her nomination doesn’t seem to exceed typical partisan divides. With a Democratic-controlled Senate, that might be all that’s needed for her ascension to the nation’s highest court.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/generation-z-future-of-faith/">Generation Z is the least religious generation yet</a>, according to recently published data from the December 2021 American National Family Life Survey from the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life. Thirty-four percent of Generation Z (those between the ages of 18 and 24) reported being religiously unaffiliated, compared with just 9 percent of those in the Silent Generation (those between the ages of 76 and 93). The survey’s authors attribute Gen Z’s lack of religious affiliation to less religious participation during their formative years, finding that compared with older generations, Gen Z was less likely to have attended religious services or educational programs, or to have prayed with their family or read religious texts while growing up. A greater share of Gen-Z Americans also said they were never religious (15 percent, compared with 10 percent of 25- to 40-year-olds, 6 percent of 41- to 56-year-olds, 3 percent of 57- to 75-year-olds, and zero percent of 76- to 93-year-olds).</li><li>Americans largely plan to tune out the 94th Academy Awards, according to a March 4-7 poll from YouGov. Forty-nine percent said they <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/j1cseekwm7/tabs_Academy_Awards_20220304.pdf">were not interested at all in watching the Oscars</a>, while just 9 percent said they were very interested. That’s in line with a March 15-18 poll from Morning Consult/Politico, where <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/21123905/2203112_crosstabs_MC_ENTERTAINMENT_OSCARS_Adults_STACKED_v2_CC.pdf">67 percent of Americans said</a> they were probably or definitely not going to watch. Of the best-picture nominees, YouGov found that “Dune” had the highest share of Americans who said they’d watched it — 26 percent — followed by “West Side Story” (25 percent) and “Don’t Look Up” (24 percent). And Morning Consult/Politico found that 22 percent had watched some or all of “Don’t Look Up,” versus 20 percent for “Dune” and 16 percent for “West Side Story.” (For more on what Americans think about the movies, you can check out <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/who-is-americas-favorite-actor/">our latest “The United Stats of America” episode here</a>.)</li><li>What schools teach is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/">a hot-button issue in the U.S.</a>, and although <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2022-03/FOR%20THE%20WEBSITE%20with%20branding%20v2%20Selzer%20Co%20GCNP%202249%20Methodology%20Document%203-21-2022.pdf">71 percent of Americans</a> said in a March 15-20 poll from Grinnell College/Selzer &amp; Company that they trusted schools in their district to ensure library books are appropriate, only 49 percent said they trusted their local district when it came to teaching about racism. (Forty-three percent said they didn’t trust their district on teaching racism, compared with the 22 percent who said the same of their district and its library books.)

According to a March 18-21 poll from Echelon Insights, a Republican firm, <a href="http://60p3co1nax34ovc830mr2sak-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/March-2022-Omnibus-EXTERNAL-TOPLINE.pdf">69 percent said that the U.S. should increase domestic production</a> in response to banning imports of Russian oil, and 62 percent said that increasing production domestically was the best way to deal with rising gas prices.

<p data-paragraph="main">Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings wrapped up on Thursday, and all indications point to Jackson being confirmed, largely along partisan lines. She would be the first Black woman and first public defender to serve on the court. Since her confirmation is expected, the hearings — similar to past ones — were more about politics. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, Galen Druke and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux discuss the messages that senators sent and whether we were able to glean anything about what kind of justice Jackson would be. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When it comes to the presidential primary calendar, it can feel like if you’re not first (or, at least, not living in one of the four states that get to vote early on), you’re last. For a long time now, that has meant that if you don’t hail from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, candidates and political media could care less what you think. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But for Democrats that might finally change. <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2008/1/2/20062199/other-states-are-sick-of-iowa-new-hampshire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concerns about</a> Iowa and New Hampshire’s <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/10/13/harry-reids-sorry-not-sorry-apology-for-disparaging-iowa-nh/73884784/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">representativeness</a> have only grown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/opinion/iowa-new-hampshire-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in recent years</a>. Not to mention that after Iowa’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/iowa-might-have-screwed-up-the-whole-nomination-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disastrous 2020 caucuses</a>, where myriad technical problems hampered the reporting of results, there have been <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/05/26/its-time-to-fix-democrats-iowa-and-new-hampshire-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed calls</a> for the Democratic Party to alter its calendar ahead of the 2024 presidential cycle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The latest push came earlier this month, when the <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2022/03/11/dnc-plan-end-iowa-caucuses-first-place-presidential-calendar-democrats/9433481002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Des Moines Register reported</a> that the Democratic National Committee was examining a draft proposal to determine which states would vote early. Under that proposal, states would seek a waiver to vote early based on multiple criteria, including a state’s “ability to run [a] fair, transparent and inclusive primary”; ethnic diversity; geographic diversity; union representation; and general election competitiveness. And although the DNC <a href="https://www.kwwl.com/news/national-democrats-continue-discussions-on-the-future-of-iowas-first-in-the-nation-caucus-status/article_33f1ac50-a3ec-11ec-8eb4-230d109c4a79.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t end up considering the proposal</a> at its March gathering, intraparty debate <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/iowa-democrats-nomination-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over the calendar will continue</a>, with the possibility that some set of these criteria will play a role in determining the voting order of states in 2024.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With that in mind, we took a look at what the primary calendar might look like if the early-voting states were determined by these sorts of criteria. Of course, not every state would apply for a waiver, and we also can’t know for sure what data the DNC would use or, moreover, what secret sauce it would employ when deciding how to weigh various data points; nor does the DNC have full top-down control over the voting order of states. But! If we set all that aside, this might still be the direction in which the party moves, so here’s a look at which states would score well — or poorly — based on the fairness of their elections, their ethnic and racial diversity, their rate of union membership and their competitiveness in the 2020 presidential election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First up is a states’ ability to run fair, transparent and inclusive primaries. Following the contentious 2016 Democratic contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, when Iowa’s caucuses featured a razor-thin margin with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-05/iowa-democrats-say-recount-impossible-in-clinton-sanders-virtual-tie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no mechanism</a> for a recount and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2016/02/03/editorial-something-smells-democratic-party/79777580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple caucus states</a> struggled to <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2016/03/02/record-caucus-crowds-catch-officials-off-guard-as-sanders-wins-colorado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handle large numbers of voters</a>, Democrats have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-will-democrats-move-away-from-caucuses-affect-the-2020-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embraced the use of primaries</a>, going from 14 caucuses in 2016 to two in 2020, and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/governor-signs-law-giving-nevada-1st-presidential-primary-78226292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely one</a> — or maybe even zero — in 2024.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Iowa and Nevada were the only 2020 caucus states" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qXWei/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="680" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">State-run primaries score well on the DNC’s election-fairness metric because those primaries give voters the ultimate flexibility in casting their votes. Generally speaking, voters have hours to vote at their local precinct (or even more time if their state allows for early voting!) and can then go about their day. This is also somewhat true for states where the <a href="http://www.frontloadinghq.com/search/label/party-run%20primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state party runs the primary</a> instead of the state government — usually because the state has no presidential primary law — but we scored state-run primaries higher because the two types aren’t equivalent: In state-run contests, the state and local government manage things and voting is similar to casting a ballot in the general election, whereas a party-run event tends to have shorter hours and fewer voting locations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Caucuses, on the other hand, score the lowest because they are much more time intensive. In Iowa, for instance, Democratic voters must commit at least a couple of hours of their evening to the process, which typically involves hearing supporters talk up each candidate, casting a vote and then potentially shifting support if the voters’ candidate doesn’t have enough backing to be “viable.” Time and accessibility are big reasons why primaries <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/historic-turnout-in-2020-not-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually have higher turnout</a> than caucuses. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as you can see in the map above, there isn’t actually that much difference between the states on this metric. Only Iowa scores really poorly, and in 2024, Iowa may be the only state that uses a caucus — provided it doesn’t go for a party-run primary<a data-footnote-id="20" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-20" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/04/republican-senators-defend-iowa-caucus-110665" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;It’s unlikely&lt;/a&gt; that Iowa’s Republican-controlled legislature will pass a presidential primary law, so if Iowa Democrats want a primary, they’ll have to run it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>20</sup></a> — as Nevada passed a law last year that established it will <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/governor-signs-law-giving-nevada-1st-presidential-primary-78226292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use a presidential primary starting in 2024</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the DNC’s next metric — the racial and ethnic diversity of a state — there is more of a stark difference. Iowa once again scores poorly as one of the whitest states in the country, but so does New Hampshire. In fact, this lack of diversity in the first two states to vote is one of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/democrats-primary-schedule-2024-478680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biggest criticisms</a> of the Democratic primary calendar, especially considering about 2 in 5 Democrats identify as people of color, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/the-changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. We don’t know how the DNC would measure the diversity of a state — for instance, would they consider the overall diversity of the state or just the diversity among Democrats? — but one straightforward way to measure a state’s diversity is to use the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Census Bureau’s Diversity Index</a>, which calculates the likelihood that two people chosen at random in a state will be from different racial and ethnicity groups. Based on that measure, western states like Hawaii, California and Nevada score extremely well, as the table below shows.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada, of course, already votes early, having gone third in the Democratic primary <a href="http://www.frontloadinghq.com/2009/03/2008-presidential-primary-calendar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2008</a>,<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, Michigan voted third in 2008, but it &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/09/04/primary.calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disobeyed party rules&lt;/a&gt; to do so and lost its delegates as a result (although it later got &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/us/politics/01rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;half of them back&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a> so between its recent switch to a primary and its sizable racial and ethnic diversity, it would score very well on these first two criteria. As for the other states that currently vote early, Iowa and New Hampshire score among the bottom six spots, while South Carolina finished right in the middle of the pack.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means the DNC might want to take note of the other places that score highly on this metric; Maryland, the District of Columbia, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Florida and Georgia round out the top 10, including the three western states we mentioned earlier. We know geographic diversity is something else the draft proposal prioritized, so if the DNC wanted to pick a Northeastern state instead of New Hampshire, the party might pay special attention to New Jersey. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New Jersey Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/move-iowa-jersey-democrats-vie-early-presidential-primary/story?id=83505174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently made the case</a> to the DNC that the Garden State should go early, and the fact that New Jersey ranks eighth in the Census’s Diversity Index suggests it would help improve the relative diversity of the early states. Not to mention, New Jersey ranks second in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s urbanization index</a>, and for a party largely built on a base of voters <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/in-2020-the-largest-metro-areas-made-the-difference-for-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living in large metropolitan areas</a>, it might also be a good fit under that metric.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Labor union membership was another criteria laid out in the draft resolution, and while participation in unions <a href="https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/private-sector-unions-corporate-legal-erosion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has declined markedly over the past 50 years</a>, organized labor remains an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-ruling-wounds-both-democrats-and-unions-neither-fatally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influential part</a> of the Democratic coalition. It <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spends millions</a> on behalf of Democratic candidates, and Biden won 56 percent of voters in union households in 2020, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to national exit polls</a>. Here, too, Hawaii tops the list, although it just narrowly edges out New York as the state with the largest share of workers who belong to unions as of 2021, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t05.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Hawaii <a href="https://elections.hawaii.gov/elections-in-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t have a presidential primary law</a> — Democrats there <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/23/politics/joe-biden-hawaii-democratic-primary-results/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used a party-run event</a> in 2020 — but the Aloha State is still an attractive early-state option (maybe most of all for campaign reporters) given how well it scores on both diversity and union membership. Union membership is also a point in favor of New York and New Jersey, which also both rank in the top 10 for diversity. Meanwhile, of the current early states, Nevada ranks 17th and New Hampshire 21st, while Iowa ranks 33rd and South Carolina finishes dead last when it comes to union participation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The last factor we’ll examine is how competitive a state was in the 2020 general election, using the popular vote margin between President Biden and then-President Donald Trump. On this metric, Georgia and Arizona top the list as both states were decided by less than a half percentage point in 2020, followed by Wisconsin, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-though-biden-won-republicans-enjoyed-the-largest-electoral-college-edge-in-70-years-will-that-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “tipping-point” state</a>, or the state that delivered the decisive 270th electoral vote Biden needed to win.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This is actually a metric where most of the current early states score fairly well, too: Nevada, New Hampshire and Iowa all rank in the top 13, while South Carolina comes in at 18th. It’s also a weak point for some of the other states that score well on diversity and union membership: Biden carried Hawaii, New Jersey and New York by at least 15 points in 2020, for instance, making them uncompetitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So where does this leave us in the early-state debate? Well, if we take each of these four components, <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/mean-normalization-and-feature-scaling-a-simple-explanation-3b9be7bfd3e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standardize the data</a> for each state<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each metric, I took a state’s value or score — for example, the share of a state’s population in a union — and subtracted the average for that category, then divided that by the standard deviation of the data for all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Also, whether a state uses a primary or a caucus can’t be calculated in quite the same way, so I gave every state that used a primary in 2020 a value of 1 (including Nevada, which is now a primary state), every state that used a party-run primary a value of 0 and every state that used a caucus -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> and then sum the scores across all four measures, Nevada is perhaps the best early-state choice for Democrats, just narrowly edging out New York:</p>

 <footer><p>The scores represent the standardization of each output, except for primary access, where states with primaries were scored as 1, states with party-run primaries were scored as 0 and caucus states were scored as -1. Primary access is based on 2020 voting method and recent changes to state law where applicable.</p>
 </footer></section></div>


<p data-paragraph="main">New Jersey and Hawaii also make the top five, as does Washington, which already experienced a primary calendar change recently, moving its primary to early March in the 2020 Democratic contest. There isn’t a ton of good news in these scores for the other three early-voting states, however, as South Carolina and New Hampshire ranked in the low 30s, while Iowa comes in at 47th.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We mentioned this earlier, but there is one other important consideration here that was not possible to score: geographic diversity among the early-voting states. And that’s something Democrats (and Republicans) already have with the current lineup. Each of the first four states comes from one of the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four census regions</a>: Nevada from the West, Iowa from the Midwest, South Carolina from the South and New Hampshire from the Northeast. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nevada seems well-positioned to hold onto its position as the key Western state under these metrics, but maybe New York or New Jersey fight to replace New Hampshire from the Northeast. Lower down the list, Michigan as the Midwestern state with the highest score looks to supplant Iowa, and Georgia edges out South Carolina as the Southern state that scores highest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we are <em>not</em> suggesting that Nevada, New York, Michigan and Georgia are about to top the 2024 Democratic primary calendar. Rather, this exercise gives us a better idea of how the different priorities laid out in the draft resolution might shake up the primary calendar. In the end, though, it’s unlikely that the DNC will take such a cut-and-dry approach. For instance, South Carolina doesn’t score all that well (32nd overall), but part of its <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-joe-biden-be-in-trouble-in-south-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeal as an early state</a> for Democrats is that it has a <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/census_2000/cb01cn176.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable Black population</a>, which is an important part of the Democratic base. And while Georgia also has a larger number of Black voters, one advantage to South Carolina is it’s not as populous, so it’s cheaper to advertise in — something that is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40270928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally true</a> of most media markets in the current early states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, say that the DNC does try to change things, states in danger of losing their primo spots on the calendar can push back. Different state laws could make it challenging to supplant Iowa and New Hampshire, too. <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/43.4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa law dictates</a>, for instance, that the state’s caucuses shall be held “at least eight days earlier” than any other presidential contest, while New Hampshire’s law <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/02/05/why-is-new-hampshire-the-first-primary-in-the-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gives discretion</a> to its secretary of state to move the date to preserve the Granite State’s status as the “first in the nation” primary. In fact, every state government and/or state party sets the date of its contest, so while the DNC can try to influence those choices, they ultimately have only so much power to set the calendar. Not to mention the GOP <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/07/republican-panel-no-changes-iowa-caucuses-2024-election-president/6695300001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t plan to make any changes</a> to its early primary calendar, which could make it even more complicated to supplant states like Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, while it’s clear Iowa and New Hampshire have plenty of reason to worry, don’t necessarily bet against them kicking off the cycle again in 2024.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">According to a <a href="https://blueprintpolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BPP-Georgia.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent survey</a> from Blueprint Polling, Republican Herschel Walker is leading Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock 49 percent to 45 percent in Georgia’s 2022 Senate race. According to <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/texas-2022-beto-and-abbott-matchup-likely-in-governor-s-race-ag-paxton-tries-to-avoid-runoff-in-republican-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another</a> from Emerson College/The Hill/Nexstar, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, leads Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke 52 percent to 45 percent. And according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/john-zogby-strategies-emi-research-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet another</a> from John Zogby Strategies/EMI Research Solutions/Unite NY, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, has 14-to-19-point leads over an array of possible Republican opponents.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These are surely good signs for Walker, Abbott and Hochul … or are they?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These polls, like <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the others</a> you’ve seen of the 2022 general election so far, were conducted seven months or more before the general election. This means that there is still plenty of time for the trajectory of a race to change — whether due to news events, campaign strategy or shifts in the national environment. But while these polls are still from very early in the election cycle, they’re already pretty useful at this stage — you just have to bear in mind that, like all polls, they come with a margin of error.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s according to our analysis of general election polls for Senate and governor conducted in the first six months of every election year going back to 1998. Using over 2,000 polls, we built polling averages for 261 Senate races and 225 gubernatorial contests that had at least one survey in the first six months, finding that these polls have a fairly strong relationship to the final results in November, as the chart below shows.<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_multivariable/bs704_multivariable5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;correlation between&lt;/a&gt; the Senate polling averages and results was .897, while the correlation between the gubernatorial polling averages and results was .839.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a></p>

Gubernatorial polls conducted during this span had a similar weighted average error of 8.6 points. That’s not super precise, but it’s also not much worse than polls conducted in the final three weeks of the 1998-2020 campaigns, which had a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted average error of 5.4 points</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Early polls have also tended to “call” races correctly more often than not this far out, though that’s a bit of a quick-and-dirty way to understand polling accuracy. In a weighted average, early Senate polls have identified the eventual winner 76 percent of the time, while early gubernatorial polls have been right 78 percent of the time. This is only marginally worse than polls conducted in the last three weeks of the campaign, which averaged out to 81 percent for the Senate and 83 percent for governor races from 1998 to 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But there’s a catch with the topline numbers for early surveys: Polls that show close races for Senate or governor — those with margins between 0 and 5 points — are essentially coin flips when it comes to being correct in November, as the table shows. The likelihood that polls nailed the eventual winner in races where the candidate has a 5-to-10 point edge or a double-digit lead is much higher, though, at roughly 75 percent and 90 percent of the time, respectively.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One more point in early polls’ favor: We found that they did not consistently overestimate either party — i.e., their weighted average bias was not disproportionately skewed toward Democrats or Republicans. Overall, early Senate polls conducted in the first six months of all races from 1998 to 2021 had only a 0.1-point weighted average bias toward Republicans, while early gubernatorial surveys had just a 0.02-point lean toward the GOP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This doesn’t mean that some <em>individual</em> cycles didn’t have significant biases — only that early polls in those cycles weren’t any more biased than polls later in those cycles. (If you’re a regular FiveThirtyEight reader, you’re probably already familiar with the fact that the late polls overestimated Democrats in both 2016 and 2020; well, it turns out the early polls did, too.) </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But good luck guessing the direction of the bias of early 2022 polls. True, in the last four cycles, early Senate polls have been about 3 to 6 points too good for Democrats. But in three of the four cycles before that, early Senate polls had overestimated Republicans — and early gubernatorial polls overestimated Republicans in 2018, too. Moreover, as the 2018 cycle showed, one set of polls could be skewed toward one party, while surveys for another office could end up biased toward the other party. Though the 2022 electoral environment <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is shaping up</a> to be <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advantageous for the GOP</a>, just how accurately the polls gauge races remains to be seen. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 election, though, there are still some takeaways for us based on our analysis of early polls in previous cycles. For instance, there’s not much we can say about Georgia’s Senate race, as Walker leads Warnock by about 2 points, on average; we found in previous cycles that when a candidate led by 0 to 5 points, the accuracy of polls was essentially a coin flip. We likely have a better sense of the ultimate outcome in Texas’s governor’s race, though, as Abbott currently leads O’Rourke by about 6 points, on average, which has historically given candidates a 3-in-4 shot at winning. Finally, in New York’s gubernatorial contest, we don’t know for sure whom each party will nominate, but assuming the apparent frontrunners do meet in November — Hochul and GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin — the early polls definitely point toward a Hochul victory, as she leads Zeldin by about 13 points, which is the sort of advantage that historically has signaled a candidate has a 9-in-10 chance of victory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So can you trust the polls this far out? Sure you can, but be careful about how you interpret them. Polls are not a precise measurement of where a race will end up, even in the final days of an election. That said, they’re pretty telling, even many months before the general election.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">It was a promise Joe Biden made during a low point in his presidential campaign, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-suffers-huge-2020-loss-in-new-hampshire-primary-2020-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after he lost both</a> the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary. Just <a href="https://apnews.com/article/stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-campaign-2016-south-carolina-3a36206929862d7c06293a5724eff2fd" data-type="URL" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-campaign-2016-south-carolina-3a36206929862d7c06293a5724eff2fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">days before the South Carolina primary</a>, when Black voters would <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/1/21160030/biden-black-vote-south-carolina-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively hand him</a> the Democratic nomination, Biden said at the end of a debate that if he were elected, he would nominate the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a promise that some Republicans have since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/20/ted-cruz-biden-promise-black-woman-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">derided as discriminatory</a> or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/gop-sen-wicker-compares-biden-s-supreme-court-pledge-affirmative-n1288211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">akin to affirmative action</a>, but the president’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</a> to fill the seat of retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, is the one notable promise to Black voters — perhaps the only one — that Biden has managed to uphold. And according to political science research and experts I spoke to, this promise of appointing the nation’s first Black woman to the Supreme Court <em>is</em> important to Black voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In February, political scientists <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/jaclyn-kaslovsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaclyn Kaslovsky</a> of Rice University and <a href="https://www.andrewrstone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew R. Stone</a> of Washington University in St. Louis published a piece in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/15/biden-supreme-court-nominee-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> about their research showing that Black Americans place a high value on what’s called “descriptive representation.” In other words, having someone who looks like them in a position of power — particularly in the judiciary — is very important to Black Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kaslovsky told me one reason why Black Americans may want more Black people in positions of power is that they’ve been historically underrepresented in politics. “There’s research arguing that group consciousness matters for how people evaluate political institutions,” she said. “So, as Black Americans become more represented in the judiciary, they may feel like their voices are legitimated by that institution.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Jackson’s confirmation process comes at an important time, too, as Black Americans have soured on Biden in the past six months, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of presidential approval polls going back to October. But while it’s possible that Jackson’s nomination offers the president a lifeline with Black voters, who overwhelmingly want to see her confirmed, there are also many reasons why Biden’s nomination of Jackson won’t be enough. Although research shows that a diverse judiciary is important to some Black voters, it’s unlikely that Jackson’s nomination will erase <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-democrats-failure-to-pass-a-voting-rights-bill-fits-a-pattern-of-failing-voters-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s longstanding problem</a> of failing to address and implement policies that would benefit <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/03/07/african-americans-are-the-democrats-most-loyal-constituency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats’ most loyal base</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Biden dropped the ball on so many things, and not just things that people hoped for or expected he’d do, but promises he made to the American public, like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062070001/student-loan-forgiveness-debt-president-biden-campaign-promise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restructuring student loan debt</a> or <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/11/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-all-americans-to-be-eligible-for-vaccinations-by-may-1-puts-the-nation-on-a-path-to-get-closer-to-normal-by-july-4th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managing the pandemic better</a> or <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/biden-promise-tracker/promise/1583/offer-8000-tax-credit-child-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implementing the child tax credit</a>,” said <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/faculty/rlr3462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert L. Reece</a>, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin. “I’d bet that type of stuff starts to become more and more prominent as the election becomes closer, especially given that Jackson’s nomination has less of an immediate impact on people’s lives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s working in Biden’s favor is that polls suggest that Black voters <em>really </em>want<em> </em>Jackson to make it through the nomination process and that her appointment is motivating them ahead of what’s expected to be a grueling midterm cycle for Democrats. While surveys on midterm enthusiasm among Black Americans are generally sparse, at least one survey from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/09/black-voters-midterms-ketanji-brown-jackson-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> shows that Black voters became more enthusiastic for the midterm elections in late February — right around the time Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/kbj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made Jackson’s nomination public</a>. Other polls similarly show Black Americans’ eagerness to get Jackson through the nomination process. According to <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-support-judge-kentanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-the-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navigator Research</a>, 89 percent of Democratic voters and 88 percent of Black voters said they trusted Biden’s judgment on who should be the next Supreme Court justice. In fact, among all races and ethnic groups, Black voters were the most likely to say they would support the Senate’s confirmation of Jackson, at 71 percent; only 11 percent of Black voters said they would oppose the confirmation, for a net support of 60 percentage points. Asian American and Pacific Islander voters had the second-highest level of support for Jackson’s confirmation: 58 percent would support her confirmation, for a net support of 51 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But enthusiasm for Biden’s Supreme Court pick hasn’t translated to support for Biden himself so far. In fact, disillusionment with his administration has increased in the past six months. </p>

Still, Biden’s approval is down overall, and the dwindling support among Black Americans is particularly notable given that this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/08/black-voters-helped-biden-get-elected-his-presidency-will-be-defined-by-how-he-acts-racial-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bloc helped clinch</a> the presidency for Biden in 2020. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, not only are Biden’s struggles with Black voters now part of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-year-in-bidens-approval-rating-is-in-troubleonly-trumps-was-lower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger trend</a> in his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abysmal approval ratings</a>, but, according to Reece, other frustrations are likely playing a role, too — for instance, a lack of movement on critical policy concerns like <a href="https://time.com/6051071/george-floyd-biden-police-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police reform</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/01/1023393344/black-leaders-question-whether-biden-will-fulfill-campaign-promises-to-black-vot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting rights legislation</a>, COVID-19 rates and inflation, which still <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-is-taking-biggest-toll-on-nonwhite-voters-wsj-poll-shows-11647255601?mod=hp_lead_pos12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately affect</a> Black Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the short term at least, it’s possible that Jackson’s confirmation — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-racism-and-sexism-could-define-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assuming it goes through smoothly</a> — will galvanize some Black voters. But, Reece warned me, if this is the <em>only </em>thing the Biden administration is banking on to court the Black vote, it’s probably not going to be enough. “People need tangible things. Not just symbolic representation to get out and vote, especially in the midterms,” he said. “Not only do <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/24/voter-turnout-always-drops-off-for-midterm-elections-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less people typically vote</a>, but <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-republicans-really-have-a-big-turnout-advantage-in-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans tend to vote</a> in higher shares.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, while the historic nature of Jackson’s nomination shouldn’t be dismissed, the Biden administration should not discount the fact that appointments and platitudes alone may not be enough to persuade Black voters to turn out in droves this year the same way <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/large-racial-turnout-gap-persisted-2020-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they did in 2020</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats have long struggled with engaging Black voters, though, and this is a symptom of a larger problem, as former FiveThirtyEight senior writer Farai Chideya <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-voters-are-so-loyal-that-their-issues-get-ignored/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained ahead of the 2016 presidential election</a>. Because Black Americans reliably vote Democratic, they are treated somewhat as a “captured” voting bloc: That is, they’re often ignored by Republicans but taken for granted by Democrats. As a consequence, Democrats in power, including Biden and current members of Congress, tend to not address or prioritize many of the policy concerns Black communities have.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Jackson’s nomination is pretty far away from the midterms, and there’s still plenty of time for voters to either forget Biden took this step or<em> </em>warm up to him before November. As the Morning Consult/Politico poll shows, along with tracking polls from <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/president-biden-job-approval-rating?crossBreak=black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov</a>, Biden’s standing among Black Americans has the potential to rebound. But, as Reece told me, “Biden will have to rely on something else to motivate Black people come November. I’m not sure if Jackson’s nomination will be the thing that gets people out of their seats for a midterm election.”</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">On Nov. 4, 2008, Barack Obama, then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a senator from Illinois</a>, was elected the first Black president of the United States. His election was seen as a hopeful moment in America and <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/human_rights_vol36_2009/fall2009/on_celebrating_an_election_as_racial_progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ushered</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05elect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots</a> of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/30/end-of-racism-oped-cx_jm_1230mcwhorter.html?sh=267378f349f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think pieces</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-oe-steele5-2008nov05-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> that his presidency was the start of a new “post-racial” society. At long last — in the eyes of many, at least — there was hope that the racial wounds that have long divided Black and white Americans would heal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That, of course, never happened. Even at the time, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/08/racism-is-the-only-reason-obama-might-lose.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain white voters</a> refused to vote for Obama because of his race, and a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-hatecrimes/election-of-obama-provokes-rise-in-u-s-hate-crimes-idUSTRE4AN81U20081124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rise in hate crimes</a> followed his win. Moreover, in the lead up to Obama’s first election, some <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1065a4RaceandPolitics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls showed that</a> only about one-third of white Americans (38 percent) thought Obama would help race relations, compared with 60 percent of Black Americans. Moreover, a plurality of white Americans thought (or, perhaps, hoped) that his candidacy would have no impact on race relations, essentially upholding the status quo. What’s more, some white voters during this period <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/rise-white-identity-politics-didn-t-start-trump-explains-michael-ncna926191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started to become resentful</a> of a Black man ascending to the highest political office. And <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-racial-stereotypes-impacted-voting-for-obama-and-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that backlash</a>, in part, spurred the election of former President Donald Trump eight years later. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump’s election killed any illusions anyone might have had about a “post-racial” America. Indeed, Trump was successful in finding a predominately white audience who lapped up his overt racism toward people of color and who were eager to embrace a rising sense of <a href="https://theconversation.com/trump-tapped-into-white-victimhood-leaving-fertile-ground-for-white-supremacists-150587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white victimhood</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump may be out of power, but those feelings aren’t. They may even be growing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With President Biden having just passed one full year in office, public opinion research shows that white Americans — and especially Republicans — see whites as victims of discrimination more than, say, Hispanic or Black Americans. According to a 2021 survey by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/18/majorities-of-americans-see-at-least-some-discrimination-against-black-hispanic-and-asian-people-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>, for example, only 17 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning Americans said there is “a lot” of discrimination against Black people in today’s society. That number rose to 26 percent when Republicans were asked whether they believed <em>white</em> people faced “a lot” of discrimination. And intense <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white racial resentment</a> remains present both among Trump’s base and in our politics today. Case in point: Trump, who’s a (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very, very early</a>) favorite to win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, is still hitting that same drum; during a recent political event, the former president went so far as to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-rally-trump-claims-covid-19-treatment-is-anti-white-people-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falsely claim</a> that white people were currently being discriminated against and sent to the “back of the line” when it came to receiving COVID-19 vaccines and treatment.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump is not the first white person to feel like a victim of discrimination or to make claims in that spirit. This phenomenon started long before him. But in the U.S., if we look at things like the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-dont-see-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial wealth gap</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-wells-fargo-black-home-loan-refinancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage denial rates</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-black-americans-are-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine-no-its-not-hesitancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 vaccination and illness rates</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-black-women-are-often-missing-from-conversations-about-police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police violence rates</a> or myriad other data sets, we quickly see plenty of systemic biases against Black Americans and other minority groups (such as increasing <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hate crimes against Asian Americans</a>). You can’t, however, find such widespread evidence for anti-white discrimination. So why have many white Americans started to see themselves<em> </em>as the victims of racial discrimination?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in 2011, Harvard Business School professor <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=326229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Norton</a> and Tufts University professor <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/psychology/people/faculty/samuel-sommers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samuel Sommers</a> published <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691611406922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> showing that white Americans perceived bias against whites as increasing from the 1950s to the 2000s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Sommers, it’s hard to pinpoint just <em>one </em>factor driving this feeling of white victimhood among white Americans. “There’s this sense that there’s only so much of anything to go around, so more of something for other groups or entities might mean less of something for me and my group,” he told us. “That makes a lot of sense when you’re talking about food at the table in front of you, but it feels like it’s getting applied to things like equal rights — or respect and status.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These feelings <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/08/racism-is-the-only-reason-obama-might-lose.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were especially prevalent in the late 2000s</a>, when white people saw a Black man rising to the nation’s highest office. But today, beyond Obama, other perceived “threats” to white Americans — such as an increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiracial nation</a> that could eventually lead to the U.S. becoming <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/26/14340542/white-fear-trump-psychology-minority-majority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a “majority-minority” society</a>, or<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/26/14340542/white-fear-trump-psychology-minority-majority" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/trump-tapped-into-white-victimhood-leaving-fertile-ground-for-white-supremacists-150587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s loss in 2020 to Biden</a> — likely fueled existing beliefs and feelings of inadequacy and victimhood among white Americans.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same is likely true of the discussions about “racial reckonings” following the murder of George Floyd, coupled with a few high-profile examples of Black people breaking barriers. Indeed, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous polling</a> has documented that white Americans — and especially white Republicans — largely think too much attention is paid to race and racial issues. And, as we wrote about in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-helped-build-the-social-safety-net-why-are-many-now-against-expanding-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last article</a>, there are additional concerns about racial minorities getting more than they deserve. Kamala Harris’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kamala-harris-biden-vice-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ascendance to the vice presidency</a> as well as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</a> to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, for example, likely further stoked white Americans’ existing hatred against Black people and other marginalized groups. To use the language of Ohio State University professor <a href="https://english.osu.edu/people/mitchell.717" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koritha Mitchell</a>, “Black success beckons the mob.” There is a phenomenon Mitchell calls “<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/715439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know-your-place aggression</a>” whereby U.S. culture celebrates the success of straight white men (regardless of their merit) but discourages, diminishes or destroys the achievements of members of other groups. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This phenomenon is related to one of the other things Sommers told us about:<strong> </strong>jockeying for stigma. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Maybe that’s a more general human phenomenon that transcends race and racism,” Sommers said, “but now we’re talking about it on a much more serious and problematic level.” When white Americans see minorities succeed, it threatens them in a way that makes them feel like victims. As Sommers puts it: “It seems like there’s some kind of status, attention or special treatment that certain white people think will be bestowed on them if they make the claim that they’ve been treated unfairly.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, for a “post-racial” America to exist, white people would need to see people of color ascending to higher political offices and an increasingly multiracial nation as a win for <em>all </em>of America. Instead, many take these things as a personal attack and view it as a loss of their <em>own</em> status at the top of America’s racial hierarchy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We see evidence for this in public opinion data, too. With the help of Kathleen Weldon and Jacob Harris of the <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roper Center for Public Opinion Research</a> — a research center that has one of the largest archives of public opinion datasets (and where one of us, Neil Lewis Jr., is a faculty affiliate) — and Natalie Jackson from the <a href="https://www.prri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Religion Research Institute</a> (PRRI), we looked at perceptions of discrimination against white Americans over time, and how those perceptions vary by both partisanship and race.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since at least the year 2000, polling firms have been asking Americans questions about how much discrimination they perceive is faced by white Americans, asking respondents to place that discrimination on a scale or to compare it to other racial and ethnic groups. And our analysis of the Roper Center’s data shows that before Obama’s first election, roughly half of Republicans perceived there to be at least some discrimination against white people. Specifically, according to a 2000 poll from Princeton Survey Research Associates/The National Conference for Community and Justice, 56 percent of Republicans said that white Americans faced at least some discrimination, and by 2005, when the organizations asked the question again, that number dipped slightly to 47 percent. However, toward the end of Obama’s first term, other polling found the share of Republicans answering a similar question to be higher, as can be seen for the years 2011 and 2012 on the chart below, which uses data from PRRI.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">PRRI has asked a slightly different question — to what extent respondents agree that discrimination against white Americans is now as significant of an issue as discrimination against Black Americans and other minorities — almost yearly between 2011 and 2020. The trend across that timespan is a bit messier, but the share of Republicans who “completely agreed” or “mostly agreed” with the statement was mostly higher during Trump’s time in office than during Obama’s. </p>

The percentage of Democrats who say there is at least “some” discrimination against whites has steadily decreased since the turn of the century, and this trend is consistent across both Roper and PRRI datasets. These trends are also consistent with new research that builds on Norton and Sommers’s initial work. In a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/e6dar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forthcoming paper</a> in the journal <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perspectives on Psychological Science</a><em>, </em>a team of researchers from Tufts, Harvard and the VA Bedford Healthcare System found that race and partisanship shape perceptions of racism as a zero-sum game. “Liberal White Americans saw racism as a zero-sum game they were winning by a lot, moderate White Americans saw it as a game they were winning by only a little,” the researchers wrote, “and conservative White Americans saw it as a game they were losing.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, race and partisanship are intertwined: The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast majority of Republicans are white</a>, and indeed, if we look at the same question by race, we see similar patterns:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1422" height="864" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-race-hires.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="621" height="1089" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png?w=621 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Samuels.Lewis-WHITE-RACISM-VICTIMS.0318-2-mobile@2x.png?w=1242 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Worryingly, these trends may be <em>increasing </em>after Biden’s inauguration. PRRI didn’t ask the same question again in 2021, so we can’t make an apples-to-apples comparison there. But according to Pew’s 2021 survey, the share of Republicans — including “leaners,” i.e., Americans leaning toward one party or the other — who said there is at least “some” discrimination against white people was 63 percent. This includes 26 percent who said there is “a lot” of discrimination against white people, which <em>looks</em> like an all-time high. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We say “looks” because the polling data we have is messy. If we compare the Pew data to past Pew data (so that the methodology and question wording is consistent), we see an increase from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/01/democrats-far-more-likely-than-republicans-to-see-discrimination-against-blacks-not-whites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> (16 percent) to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/18/majorities-of-americans-see-at-least-some-discrimination-against-black-hispanic-and-asian-people-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a> (26 percent) for the share of Republicans saying white Americans face “a lot” of discrimination. Those are only two data points, of course. We’ll need more polling to know how to interpret that result for sure.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, other recent polls have yielded similar findings with different questions. <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/project-home-fire-center-for-politics-research-reveals-outsized-role-immigration-plays-in-fueling-our-national-divide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a>, using a summer 2021 poll conducted by Project Home Fire and InnovateMR, found that only 38 percent of Trump voters either somewhat or strongly agreed that white people have advantages over people of color (compared with 87 percent of Biden voters). Moreover, 84 percent of Trump voters expressed concern that bigotry against white people will surge in the coming years. Meanwhile, only 38 percent of Biden voters felt the same way.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s striking is how these perceptions persist even in the face of extraordinary evidence to the contrary. We have already discussed some domestic evidence about the persistence of racial discrimination against minority groups. Additionally, on the international stage, we see anti-Black racism manifesting even during a war: Journalists <a href="https://twitter.com/Sifill_LDF/status/1498512483690102784?s=20&amp;t=MeCWB6dPrSMtQuc56eZcpA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitoring the invasion in Ukraine</a> have reported that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/open-door-die-africans-report-racism-hostility-trying-flee-ukraine-rcna17953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black people are being violently removed</a> from <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/african-students-racism-ukraine-invasion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trains trying to get people to safety</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What could be fueling an increase in these views? Following Trump’s loss in 2020, the Republican Party leaned further into messages that paint Republicans and white people as victims of an overzealous movement for racial justice. For example, Fox News coverage of critical race theory — a decades-old framework for legal scholarship — surged during the Virginia gubernatorial campaign, according to a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-critical-race-theory-glenn-youngkin-1650208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsweek analysis</a>, only to quickly and starkly dip following Republican Glenn Youngkin’s win. And several pundits pointed to education and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/opinion/crt-backlash-du-bois.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-virginias-electorate-shifted-toward-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasons for his success</a>. Republicans have also<em> </em><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a seemingly successful political strategy</a> in attacking and amplifying race-related buzzwords, such as “woke,” once used in activist circles. And as FiveThirtyEight contributors Hakeem Jefferson and Victor Ray pointed out on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, the current narratives of victimization and the associated backlash to racial progress are some white people’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way of reckoning</a> with the changing times. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sommers underscored the gravity of leadership’s role in these processes when we talked with him: “If we’ve learned nothing else in the last five or so years, it’s just how influential top-down attitudes are. When leaders around the country and at a regional level are using racist or vulgar language themselves, that seems to move the needle on what’s considered normative and acceptable behavior in our society.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If we want to address the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inequities that continue to plague and divide our society</a>, white Americans — and in particular, white Republicans — will need to move away from the victimhood narrative and acknowledge our current reality. And the extent that the inequities can be muted or even mitigated depends heavily on what politicians choose to emphasize in the narratives that they construct about the state of our union. The success of minorities does not mean victimization for white Americans. Without recognition that we can all succeed — and that the nation will be better off for it — the patterns of disparities we have discussed throughout will continue to persist, and we will all be worse off for it.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Here we go again. For the fourth time in five years, the strange rituals of the Supreme Court confirmation process have overtaken the Capitol. In the weeks since U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/kbj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was formally named</a> as President Joe Biden’s nominee to fill a soon-to-be-vacant spot on the high court, she has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/02/ketanji-brown-jackson-senators-confirmation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paying courtesy visits</a> to the senators who will vote on her confirmation. Now she’s made it through the gauntlet of private chitchat and is heading into an onslaught of public questions, none of which anyone really expects her to answer.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Supreme Court confirmation hearings have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kavanaugh-was-quietly-conservative-on-day-2-of-his-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a predictable rhythm</a>, and this one doesn’t look like it will be an exception. Jackson will face a several-day barrage of broad and complex questions about her background, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-were-willing-to-break-the-rules-on-kavanaugh-day-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her philosophy as a judge</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-battle-lines-are-set-after-the-first-day-of-the-amy-coney-barrett-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her stance on hot-button issues</a>. Democrats will grandstand and lob her softballs. Republicans will grandstand and try to paint her as a radical. Jackson will smile and offer a series of polite nonanswers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These hearings feel like they should be consequential — after all, Jackson is up for a lifetime seat on the country’s most powerful court. But the process of confirming a Supreme Court justice has mostly become just another partisan performance. Barring a last-minute surprise, the outcome is already sealed, and everyone knows it. Democrats have the votes, so Jackson is almost certain to be confirmed within a matter of weeks. Her presence on the court — while historic — won’t do anything to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-roberts-court-vs-the-trump-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change its conservative tilt</a>. The main question is whether a Republican or two, sensing a low-cost opportunity to make a gesture toward bipartisan harmony, will cross the aisle to vote for her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As I said, strange rituals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The task of confirming would-be justices wasn’t always so drawn out, or so political. Early in the nation’s history, it might only take a couple of days for a Supreme Court nominee to be confirmed once they were named by the president. As the Supreme Court has grown more powerful and high-profile, the process has gotten longer and talkier. Since the mid-20th century, when the high court began to wade deeper into contentious battles over civil rights, the length of time between a justice being nominated and confirmed <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/07/up-until-the-postwar-era-u-s-supreme-court-confirmations-usually-were-routine-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has grown dramatically</a>, in large part because of the addition of public hearings. Jackson’s confirmation process may end up looking short compared to other modern justices, but that’s only because it’s taken months for many recent justices to be confirmed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Senators have also grown more eager to publicly weigh in on nominees’ qualifications. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-confirmation-hearings-have-more-questions-and-fewer-answers-than-ever-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis from 2018</a>, the number of issues that were covered during the hearings has increased in recent years too, with a special focus on topics that have gotten more politically important, like civil rights and judicial philosophy. But that doesn’t mean nominees are sharing more about their actual views on the issues voters care about — in fact, when they’re asked about issues that could come before the Supreme Court in the future, they <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/2020/10/why-do-supreme-court-nominees-avoid-answering-so-many-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely refuse to say anything</a>. “He has responded to many questions over the course of these hearings but he has adequately answered far too few of them,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/weekinreview/alito-vs-roberts-word-by-word.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sen. Patrick Leahy complained</a> after three days of back-and-forth with now-Justice Samuel Alito.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/14/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-confirmation-00016594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans have promised</a> Jackson a “respectful” back-and-forth. Whether that actually happens, of course, remains to be seen. It might not seem worthwhile to turn these hearings into a partisan bloodbath — after all, Jackson’s nomination won’t shift the ideological balance of the court, which will retain a 6-3 conservative majority. But <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-racism-and-sexism-could-define-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-hearings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I wrote earlier this month</a>, it’s possible that racist or sexist lines of questioning could filter into the hearings in subtle or explicit ways, and raise the temperature of the interrogations. Jackson is pretty popular overall, which makes this strategy risky — <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/03/08161506/2203034_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJPOLL032022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-support-judge-kentanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-the-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polls</a> have found that about half of Americans want the Senate to confirm her to the Supreme Court, and only around 30 percent are opposed to her confirmation. (The rest said they didn’t know.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are certain aspects of Jackson’s background that the senators seem likely to linger on. Her supporters will highlight the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic nature of her nomination</a>, as the first Black woman and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/15/ketanji-brown-jackson-would-first-federal-defender-supreme-court/9424483002/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public defender</a> to be tapped for the Supreme Court. They’ll also emphasize her impeccable qualifications. On the other hand, her detractors are likely to seize on her career as a public defender as evidence that her ideology is too extreme, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-criminal-defense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly on issues like crime</a>. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley previewed a potential line of attack in a Twitter thread last week where <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1504221927665250305?s=20&amp;t=tXLuj3W9RcrHOhdCJGAi7Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he claimed</a> that Jackson had a “pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook.” The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-criminal-defense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized her work</a> representing detainees at Guantánamo Bay.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And depending on their mood, other Republican senators may argue that she has the wrong qualifications for the job — in the past few weeks, conservatives have implied both that she’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/tucker-carlson-ketanji-brown-jackson-lsat-scores-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not qualified</a> and that she’s <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1497218325394374709?s=20&amp;t=ClLfsxf5qWp63pX_i52eaQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too qualified</a>. Alternatively, opponents may hone in on the cases where her decisions as a trial court judge were reversed by higher courts. That line of attack might not be very fruitful, though; According to an analysis of Jackson’s record as a trial court judge by law professors Josh Fischman and Kevin Cope, her reversal rate is low, like most of the other judges in the District of D.C. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These hearings, then, are really about politics, not Jackson herself. We already have a pretty good idea of where Jackson would land, and Republicans are unlikely to ferret out anything new. Over the years, as control of the Supreme Court has become an increasingly high-stakes political issue, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/bidens-supreme-court-pick-thrills-progressives-looking-win-rcna17429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocacy groups</a> have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/us/politics/severinos-amy-coney-barrett.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed presidents</a> to nominate justices who are <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/09/david-souter-the-supreme-court-justice-who-built-the-trump-court-218953/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideologically predictable</a>. Jackson is no exception. It’s true that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-ketanji-brown-jackson-could-change-the-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on the empirical metrics we have</a>, it’s not clear exactly where she’d fall on the court’s left wing, but she would almost certainly be a reliable liberal vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For that reason, Jackson will be lucky to get even a sliver of bipartisan support. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-harder-than-ever-to-confirm-a-supreme-court-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley wrote in February</a>, successful Supreme Court nominees used to get the overwhelming support of senators in both parties, but those days have been over for a while. All of Trump’s nominees were confirmed with very narrow margins. Jackson <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/595822-the-three-republicans-who-voted-to-confirm-brown-jackson-for-appeals-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did get three Republican votes</a> when she was nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year — but there’s no guarantee those senators will remain on her side now that a Supreme Court seat is up for grabs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But unless a moderate Democrat unexpectedly defects, which seems unlikely right now, Jackson’s path to the Supreme Court looks smooth. Occasionally, big and important issues do come up that pose a real threat to the nominee’s confirmation — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/27/652309743/christine-blasey-ford-describes-alleged-sexual-assault-by-kavanaugh-before-senat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the allegations that Justice Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape a woman in high school</a> are a notable recent example. For the most part, though, Supreme Court confirmation hearings have become very similar to other televised congressional spectacles — an opportunity for senators to advertise their own ideological sentiments in viral soundbites. This time, the fact that control of the court isn’t at stake isn’t likely to stop senators from seizing the spotlight, and it certainly won’t speed the hearings along. At worst, that could mean the next few days descend into ugly race-baiting rhetoric — and at best, it could make the process feel pretty empty.</p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Congress can’t agree on much lately — except, apparently, their hatred of changing the clocks twice a year. On Tuesday, just after Americans set their clocks an hour forward over the weekend, the Senate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/us/politics/daylight-saving-time-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously passed a bill</a> that would make daylight saving time permanent (although they still have to send it to the House for consideration). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Supporters of the bill presented it as a gift for a groggy country struggling to get its sleep back on track. And it’s true that the annual clock-changing ritual is not especially popular. A <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_031522/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University poll</a> conducted March 10-14 found that only 35 percent of Americans wanted to keep resetting their clocks every fall and spring, while a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/03/16/1742a/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov poll</a> conducted March 16 found that 59 percent of Americans wanted to see daylight saving time made permanent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, putting the whole country on daylight saving time year-round seems like a no-brainer. But we’ve been there before, and it’s still unclear whether Americans would actually like permanent daylight saving time if they got it. Because while longer afternoons and a consistent schedule are appealing, there’s a tradeoff — dark winter mornings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the past four years, support for making daylight saving time permanent has really gained steam, and not just in Congress. According to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/daylight-savings-time-state-legislation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, 18 states have passed legislation or enacted resolutions that would switch to permanent daylight saving time if Congress allowed it (and in some cases, if surrounding states also made the change).</p>


<div><iframe title="More than a third of states want DST year-round" aria-label="Map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zADPk/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="640" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>



<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, federal law doesn’t currently allow for permanent daylight saving time, so Congress has to take the lead, which is why the bill that just passed is a big step for proponents of daylight saving time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Originally, daylight saving time was implemented during World War I as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/climate/daylight-saving-time-electricity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a way to conserve energy</a>. The idea was that changing the clocks during the months with the most sunlight would encourage people to use less electricity. That <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/01/1050492391/daylight-saving-time-history-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t seem to be the case</a>, though. Instead, the real winners of daylight saving time are <a href="https://www.convenience.org/Media/Daily/2022/Mar/14/1-Daylight-Saving-Time-Is-Good-for-Business_GR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businesses</a>, since people are <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/who-really-benefits-daylight-savings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to go out and shop</a> when they have an extra hour or two of sunlight after work. So, a switch to permanent daylight saving time would be <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/01/1050492391/daylight-saving-time-history-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a boon</a> for lots of industries — especially those for outdoor activities like sports and gardening.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What everyday people actually want, though, isn’t as clear. Polling shows that people generally don’t like the disruption of gaining or losing an hour twice a year, although their feelings might not be as strong as politicians make it out to be. In an <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/xtubiu759r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted days before the clocks changed in November, for instance, only 21 percent of Americans said they were looking forward to the end of daylight saving time coming up, while 34 percent said they weren’t looking forward to it; 38 percent said they didn’t care. But there was more consensus on the concept of changing the clocks than on the solution: Among the 63 percent of people who wanted to eliminate the practice of gaining or losing an hour, 48 percent said they wanted permanent daylight saving time, 29 percent said they wanted permanent standard time and 21 percent had no preference.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Older Americans, it turns out, are also much more likely than younger Americans to dislike the time changes. The Economist/YouGov poll found that an overwhelming majority of respondents 65 and over (77 percent) wanted to eliminate the twice-yearly time change compared with less than half of respondents age 18 to 29 (42 percent). To be clear, those younger people aren’t strongly in favor of keeping the clock change: They were just about as likely to say they didn't want to change the clocks (27 percent) as they were to say they weren't sure (31 percent). But they were also less in favor of permanent daylight saving time than older people were, by 30 percent to 54 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This division could hint at one of the big reasons why people really don’t like changing the clocks: It can be physically disruptive. Messing with sleep patterns can affect our <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/daylight-savings-shows-how-your-metabolism-works-on-a-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating habits</a> or <a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/daylight-saving-time-sleep-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental functioning</a> throughout the day. And an abrupt shift like adding or losing an hour can be especially troublesome for <a href="https://www.agingcare.com/articles/daylight-saving-time-health-156410.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older people</a>, who may already have more fragmented sleep. It can also upset bedtimes and nap routines for <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/parents/daylight-saving-time-sleep-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small children</a>, and even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pets-dogs-cats-daylight-savings-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make pets fussy</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in exchange for later sunsets, people have to be OK with dark mornings. And that’s not a universally popular tradeoff. Americans actually experimented with permanent daylight saving time starting in January 1974, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/15/no-more-changing-clocks-history-says-be-careful-what-you-wish-daylight-saving-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it didn’t go well</a>. As reported in The Washington Post, support for year-round daylight saving time fell from a majority in late 1973 to around 30 percent in February and March 1974. According to Louis Harris polling that March, people were much more likely to say the change was a bad idea (43 percent) than a good one (19 percent). Parents who found themselves sending their children to school on pitch-black, cold winter mornings were particularly upset.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment ended that fall, when the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/01/archives/senate-votes-return-to-standard-time-for-four-months-and-sends-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Senate agreed&lt;/a&gt; to scrap permanent daylight saving time and &lt;a href="https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0055/1668702.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;President Gerald Ford signed&lt;/a&gt; the bill into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a> But anyone who wakes up on the early side — <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/wake-me-up-series-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which many Americans do</a> — might also dislike slogging through an extra hour of darkness as they begin their day. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/get-ready-to-spring-forward-into-daylight-saving-time-and-longer-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleep scientists</a> have argued that permanent standard time is <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2022/03/12/daylight-saving-time-spring-forward-fall-back-change-clocks-sleep-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more in sync</a> with our body’s natural rhythms. We might like an extra hour of light at the end of the day, their argument goes, but we <em>need</em> that extra hour of morning light. And regional differences play a role, too. It’s probably no coincidence that one of permanent daylight saving time’s biggest boosters is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, since states farther south <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/@3558773?month=1&amp;year=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t running the risk</a> of a 9 a.m. sunrise, even at the darkest times of year. But <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/what-would-happen-if-michigan-kept-daylight-saving-time-all-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northern states</a>, and states on the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-daylight-saving-time-poses-a-host-of-health-concerns-according-to-a-neurologist#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cwestern%20edge%E2%80%9D%20effect,edge%20of%20a%20time%20zone." target="_blank" rel="noopener">western edges of time zones</a>, would face longer stretches of morning darkness.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another possibility, of course, is to stop putting all the weight of adjusting to the seasons onto the clocks and instead tweak our own schedules to gradually move the start time of our day. But that’s harder to legislate, so we’re left with some pretty unsatisfying options. We can keep dealing with the hassle of changing the clocks — or we can accept that, for a few months at least, we’ll either start or end our days in the dark. Which would you choose?</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-economic-impact/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-economic-impact/">Lower-income workers, in particular, have faced difficulties during the omicron surge</a> of the coronavirus, according to a Feb. 9-21 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, 60 percent of workers living in a household making less than $40,000 annually said they had missed work in the past three months due to concerns over COVID-19, versus 33 percent of workers whose households earned between $40,000 and $89,999 annually and 43 percent of workers whose households made $90,000 or more annually. Moreover, just 32 percent of workers in lower-income households received paid time off if they got sick from COVID-19, compared with 57 percent of workers in households making $40,000 or more per year. Because these lower-income workers lack paid time off, a greater share came to work sick — 29 percent of workers in households making less than $40,000 annually said they went to work while symptomatic or after exposure to COVID-19 because they couldn’t afford to take time off; just 6 percent of workers in households making $40,000 or more said they had to do the same.</li></ul><ul><li>The <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/03/15/f1-fandom-netflix/">share of Americans who call themselves fans of a motorsport has revved up</a> in the past two years, according to polls from Morning Consult conducted Feb. 20-23, 2020, and March 5-7, 2022. While NASCAR still had the greatest share of fans, at 40 percent, Formula 1 saw its fan base increase the most (from 21 percent in 2020 to 28 percent in 2022), though MotoGP’s increase was a close second, at 6 percentage points. NASCAR, IndyCar and NHRA all gained fans, too, though by a more modest amount. The Netflix documentary series “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” which chronicles the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-drive-to-survive-remade-formula-1">annual struggle for the Formula One World Championship</a>, seems to be driving this boost in popularity. More than half of self-identified Formula 1 fans in the U.S. (53 percent) said the show, which <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/10/formula-1-drive-to-survive/619814/">developed a cult following</a> since its debut in 2019, was a major or minor reason why they became a fan.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/03/14/most-climate-scientists-expect-catastrophe">Climate scientists sound far more pessimistic than the American public</a> about the consequences of climate change, according to a September 2021 survey by Nature that polled authors and review editors of the latest report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a March 10-13 U.S. News Poll of American adults by YouGov that asked the same questions. For example, while just 25 percent of Americans said they thought they would see catastrophic impacts of climate change in their lifetimes, 66 percent of the climate scientists who responded to the Nature survey said the same. Meanwhile, just 35 percent of Americans said they felt anxiety, grief or other distress due to concerns about climate change, versus 61 percent of the experts polled. That said, as to whether climate-related concerns might overrule one’s desire to have children, climate scientists were roughly in line with the general public, even though research has found that having one fewer child is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children">the most effective thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint</a>. Just 17 percent of the climate scientists who answered the question said global warming has made them reconsider having children, versus 18 percent of the general public.</li></ul><ul><li>According to a March 3-7 poll from Navigator, <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-support-judge-kentanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-the-court/">President Biden and the Democratic Party have an edge over the GOP</a> when it comes to which party Americans trust more to “put the right people on the Supreme Court.” Forty-six percent of registered voters said they trusted Biden and the Democrats more, while 39 percent said they trusted Republicans more. A slight majority (51 percent) of voters said they would support the Senate confirming Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, including 73 percent of voters who said they were familiar with her, while 27 percent of all voters were undecided and 22 percent opposed the confirmation.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/03/15/public-expresses-mixed-views-of-u-s-response-to-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/">Democrats and Republicans are largely united</a> on U.S. economic and military strategy toward Russia, but they seem more divided on accepting Ukrainian refugees, according to a March 7-13 poll from the Pew Research Center. For instance, Pew found that an overwhelming majority of Democrats (88 percent) and Republicans (85 percent) supported “keeping strict economic sanctions on Russia,” while just over a third (35 percent of Democrats, 36 percent of Republicans) supported “taking military action even if it risks a nuclear conflict with Russia.” But the parties sharply diverged when asked about “admitting thousands of Ukrainian refugees into the U.S.” — 80 percent of Democrats supported this policy versus 57 percent of Republicans, a 23-point gap.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>
