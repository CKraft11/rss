<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In a break with Virginia’s recent electoral history, Republican Glenn Youngkin bested Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the state’s highly contentious governor’s race on Tuesday. Polls going into election night <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the two neck-and-neck</a>, but given McAuliffe had led the race until about a week before the election, it was still largely viewed as McAuliffe’s to lose — especially since Virginia Republicans had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/us/elections/youngkin-wins-virginia-governor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not won a statewide race since 2009</a> and Biden carried the state by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 percentage points last year</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So who powered Youngkin’s win? Well, he overperformed across the state, but exit polling data shows he did especially well among certain voting blocs — like white voters (both men and women) and voters without a college degree — which gave his campaign a boost. But one of the biggest factors for Youngkin might have been his strong showing among suburban voters. According to exit poll data, Youngkin won 53 percent of these voters across the state, which is roughly the opposite of what happened in 2020, when exit polls suggest President Joe Biden carried voters in those areas with a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrat-mcauliffe-facing-52-unfavorable-numbers-va-governor/story?id=80935662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar share of the vote</a>.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit polls are always at least a little bit prone to error &amp;#8212; they are still surveys, after all &amp;#8212; but this was &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/exit-polls-can-be-misleading-especially-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;especially true in the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; given how much of the electorate voted absentee. It’s likely this comparison isn’t apples-to-apples but it’s still a useful benchmark for understanding the shift among suburban voters in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In short, we identified three main throughlines that we think are useful at this stage when discussing Youngkin’s upset: </p>



<ul><li>First and foremost, this is a story about suburban voters, who, on average, moved to the right. That is, as we suggested, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/">a departure from what we observed nationally</a> in the 2020 presidential election.</li><li>Education issues that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/11/03/school-board-races-show-mixed-results-critical-race-theory/6271364001/">dominated much</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/politics-policy/irony-ban-beloved-virginia-can-found-pages-book-rcna4081">of the lead-up to</a> Tuesday’s race were significant for understanding how voters felt about the candidates, but it’s actually really hard to isolate the role education played in the race.</li><li>Rather, disappointment in — or opposition to — Biden’s presidency may have been the main driver of this outcome, as is often the case in off-year Virginia elections.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">Let’s assess these one at a time: For starters, we (Geoffrey) <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote earlier this week</a> that the big reason Youngkin was successful was his strength in the suburban areas of the state where former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/trump-broke-suburbs-gop-virginia-516412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously struggled</a>. That’s especially true in Loudoun County, one of the most populous suburban enclaves in the commonwealth. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Virginia's suburbs swung towards Youngkin" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Skxj/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="478" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In Loudoun, McAuliffe underperformed relative to his party’s performance in 2020 while Youngkin overperformed: Although McAuliffe carried the county by 11 points, that marked a huge departure from Biden’s 25-point edge there last year. But Youngkin’s improved showing came across much of northern Virginia near Washington, D.C. (including Loudoun) as well as in predominantly suburban and exurban localities like Virginia Beach and Chesapeake in the southeastern corner of the state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In unpacking <em>why</em> Youngkin made inroads in the suburbs, though, things get more challenging. From the beginning, Youngkin straddled being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/01/trump-republican-governor-race-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-Trump but not so Trumpy</a> that he repelled suburban voters and white women (groups Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/upshot/election-polling-trump-women.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famously struggled with</a>). And because much of the previous suburban shift toward Democrats appears to have been driven by disdain for Trump, it’s now unclear that these gains will hold when Trump is off the ballot. It didn’t hurt that Youngkin, clad in a fleece vest most of the campaign, was able to posit himself as the spitting image of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/elections/glenn-youngkin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genial suburban dad</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Interestingly, though, it doesn’t look like white college-educated voters, often <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/27/895867508/2020-suburban-voters-who-are-they" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately associated with the suburbs</a>, necessarily drove Youngkin’s victory. The polarization of white voters by educational attainment <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been a developing trend</a> in recent years, and the Virginia result shows an even more substantial split, thanks mainly to Youngkin gaining among white voters without a college degree. Remember, <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=&amp;t=Educational%20Attainment%3ARace%20and%20Ethnicity&amp;g=0400000US51%240500000&amp;y=2019&amp;tid=ACSDT1Y2019.B15002H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of white voters</a> without a four-year degree live in suburban places, too.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, McAuliffe still narrowly edged Youngkin among white voters with a college degree; in fact, his margin <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn’t much different from Biden’s</a> in Virginia last November. By contrast, there wasn’t really much indication of an education gap among voters of color. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Second, while education-related issues — whether it was critical race theory or related to the pandemic — did seem to have had some effect on Tuesday’s results, it doesn’t seem like they alone influenced voters enough to push Youngkin over the edge. That doesn’t mean Youngkin didn’t make a concerted effort to appeal to parents, though. Throughout his campaign, he made subtle and not-so-subtle <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/virginia-governor-youngkin-education-gop-516625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeals to them by preying on fears</a> around things like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical race theory</a> being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/us/politics/beloved-toni-morrison-virginia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taught in the classroom</a>. It wasn’t just the question of how race should be discussed in schools either. Youngkin also made appeals to parents fed up with more than a year of remote learning and other COVID-19-related school policies, like <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/who-is-glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-policies-beliefs/2866115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring masks in schools</a>. But all of this falls under the category of “education,” which makes it incredibly hard to disentangle which issue had a bigger impact on voters. And as we’ll discuss below, it’s not clear that education was even the most important factor for voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While roughly 59 percent of men with children under the age of 18 living in their home, for instance, supported Youngkin over McAuliffe, a majority of women with children (53 percent) backed McAuliffe. Similarly, a majority of men without children (56 percent) backed Youngkin, while women without children (54 percent) backed McAuliffe. In other words, men voted similarly regardless of their parental status, as did women.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, these numbers could be explained in part by the simple fact that men tend to vote Republican, while women, on average, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to vote Democratic</a>. But the gender gap among parents here is notable because it makes it more difficult to pinpoint what education issues were the most salient to voters. Also, it’s possible that “nonparents,” by the exit poll’s definition, included a lot of younger and older voters who might have canceled each other out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if parental status wasn’t the most important thing in unpacking how voters voted on Tuesday, we shouldn’t discount the role education played in Tuesday’s race. Exit polling found that voters who believe parents should have “a lot” of say in what their child’s school teaches overwhelmingly supported Youngkin over McAuliffe (77 percent to 22 percent). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other issues were also top of mind for voters, though. Polls ahead of Tuesday show that the <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginia-voters-economy-top-issue-when-voting-in-2021-election/65-29347cb5-a4b0-48bf-8c4b-180f4f33d48d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy topped voters’ list</a> of concerns. According to exit polling data, Youngkin won those voters, who were one-third of the respondents, with 55 percent of the vote compared to McAuliffe’s 44 percent. Youngkin also edged McAuliffe among the 8 percent of voters who named abortion as the top issue in the commonwealth: 58 percent to 41 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it really does seem like disappointment with Biden’s presidency is what ultimately drove support for Youngkin. Not only does <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-campaigns-virginia-election-2020-terry-mcauliffe-180e2815215619c97a931355f4cf6876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting already suggest</a> that some people who supported Biden last year <a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/11/03/republicans-bucked-virginias-blue-state-trend-here-are-a-few-reasons-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t vote in Virginia’s election</a>, but those who disapprove of Biden made up a majority of voters and voted overwhelmingly for Youngkin. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, 59 percent of voters who said they “somewhat” disapproved of the way Biden is handling his job as president and 96 percent who “strongly” disapproved backed Youngkin. Moreover, almost twice the share of people who had an unfavorable view of Trump backed Youngkin (17 percent) than the share who disapproved of Biden and backed McAuliffe (10 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, as with any election, it’s really hard to disentangle whether macro trends (Biden’s approval) versus local factors (education and the economy) had the biggest impact on the shifts toward the GOP. But they are related, and if Democrats want to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/joe-biden-plan-midterms-shellacking-458316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid a midterm shellacking</a> next year, they might want to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/opinion/virginia-election-democratic-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritize some of these</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/03/1051713890/election-analysis-virginia-new-jersey-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more local issues</a> that at least Virginians demonstrated could be important.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>

This is up 11 points from when AP-NORC last asked this question in September. But Americans are split on whether the economy will improve: 30 percent of adults said they expected the economy to improve next year while 47 percent said they thought it will get worse.</li><li>In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/02/cop26-climate-summit-live-updates/">Biden’s closing remarks</a> on Tuesday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, he pointed to Democrats’ spending bill as America’s contribution to the fight against climate change. Only one problem: Congress is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/house-reconciliation-package-explainer/index.html">still debating</a> what will be in the bill. On climate specifically, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html">a number of key provisions have already been cut</a>, with some items, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/democrats-update-reconciliation-bill-as-they-prepare-to-vote/">like a fee on methane emissions</a>, still being ironed out. But per a Morning Consult poll taken last month, voters have started to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/28/climate-politics-biden-approval/">doubt Biden’s ability</a> to deliver on his campaign promise of sweeping climate legislation. Just 48 percent of registered voters said they approved of Biden’s handling of climate change, with 31 percent saying they somewhat approved and 17 percent saying they strongly approved.</li><li>Overall, though, Americans <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-not-yet-sold-build-back-better">aren’t following Democrats’ spending bill or the bipartisan infrastructure bill</a> <em>too</em> closely. An <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-not-yet-sold-build-back-better">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> taken Oct. 29-30 found that a plurality of Americans, 44 percent, only knew “just some” of what might be in the bills. This is understandable given that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-democrats-adding-paid-family-leave-back-social/story?id=80950206">what’s in the bill is still changing</a>, but almost half of respondents, 45 percent, said they weren’t following negotiations carefully. </li><li>Americans increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/#part3">don’t trust their own political institutions</a>, and on the world stage, some countries also don’t <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/01/what-people-around-the-world-like-and-dislike-about-american-society-and-politics/">think America is a great example of democracy</a>. The Pew Research Center in February <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/01/what-people-around-the-world-like-and-dislike-about-american-society-and-politics/">surveyed 16 countries</a>, finding a median of 57 percent of respondents thought the U.S. used to be a good example of democracy but hasn’t been in recent years. However, one of the areas in which countries thought the U.S. excelled was technological advancements. A median of 72 percent of respondents across these 16 countries said the U.S. was the best or above average in technological achievements.</li><li>Many Americans, 56 percent, told the Public Religion Research Institute in its 2021 American Values Survey, conducted in September, <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/competing-visions-of-america-an-evolving-identity-or-a-culture-under-attack/">that they thought believing in God was important to being truly American</a>, but a <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2021/10/28/in-u-s-far-more-support-than-oppose-separation-of-church-and-state/">separate poll from Pew</a> conducted in March found that many Americans, 55 percent, think separation of church and state is important. Twenty-eight percent said they strongly supported the two institutions’ separation while 27 percent moderately supported their separation.</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-a-good-election-night-for-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great night for Republicans</a>. The GOP <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flipped the governor’s office in Virginia</a>, a race often seen as a bellwether for the following year’s midterm elections (though perhaps this is an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/#319479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overreaction</a>). But that wasn’t all. Even more impressively, Republicans came <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gov-phil-murphy-projected-winner-jersey-governors-race/story?id=80933002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarkably close to winning the New Jersey governor’s race</a>, which was not thought to be nearly as competitive.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Looking ahead to the 2022 midterms, the better omen for the GOP might be how consistently they outperformed expectations across the board on Tuesday night. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans won not only the governorship in Virginia but also the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/politics/winsome-sears-virginia-lieutenant-governor-race/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lieutenant governor’s office</a> and <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2021/11/herring-concedes-to-miyares-in-virginia-attorney-general-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attorney general’s office</a>. They appear to have gained one seat on net in the New Jersey state Senate and at least four (<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/legislature/dimaio-elected-assembly-minority-leader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perhaps as many as eight</a>) in the New Jersey General Assembly. And they won several down-ballot offices that hadn’t gotten as much attention, such as a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/spl/pennsylvania-supreme-court-candidates-2021-election-results-20211102.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state Supreme Court seat</a> in Pennsylvania and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/republican-election-results-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">municipal offices</a> in New York. But the icing on the cake is that they took a majority in the <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/republicans-claim-house-majority-after-flipping-6th-seat/article_806a4149-8b34-5f6b-a908-032a70478aea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia House of Delegates</a>, putting them just one vote in the state Senate away from full control of state government. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And these state-legislative elections arguably <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-virginia-mississippi-and-kentucky-can-tell-us-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have the most to tell us</a> about what the political environment will be in 2022. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/special-elections-so-far-point-to-a-democratic-wave-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we’ve written previously</a>, special elections for both Congress and state legislatures can be quite predictive of the midterm elections they lead up to — as long as you consider them in aggregate and look at their margins of victory, not just who won.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far, neither party has consistently punched above its weight in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional special elections held in 2021</a>. Perhaps this was, in part, because most special elections happened earlier in the year, when Biden was still popular. However, his approval ratings have since sunk (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 percent approval, 51 percent disapproval</a>),<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> and this week we got results from 100 Virginia House of Delegates elections and 40 New Jersey state Senate elections that took place under that anti-Democratic environment<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article won’t analyze the 40 elections for New Jersey General Assembly, the state’s lower chamber, that were also held on Tuesday. General Assembly districts elect two legislators each, and all candidates in the district run in the same race; the top two vote-getters are elected. This irregular arrangement makes Assembly races too different from typical elections to reliably analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> — and they exhibited a clear pattern of Republican overperformance. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On average, the current<a data-footnote-id="5" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> margins in those state-legislative races<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more specifically, those where both a Democrat and a Republican were active candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> are 7 percentage points better for Republicans than their districts’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight partisan leans</a>.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall.

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> Specifically, Republicans overperformed by an average of 7 points in the Virginia House of Delegates:</p>

 <p>Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.</p>

</div>


<p data-paragraph="main">This overperformance was consistent — Republicans outran partisan lean in almost every district. It was also the biggest overperformance we’ve seen in the three times that we’ve done this analysis for odd-year legislative elections — although, in fairness, that’s still a pretty small sample size. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2017-elections-suggest-incumbency-wont-save-republicans-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2017</a>, Democrats overperformed in the Virginia House of Delegates by 2 points and in the New Jersey Senate by 5 points; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-virginia-mississippi-and-kentucky-can-tell-us-about-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a>, Democrats overperformed in the Virginia state Senate by 4 points and in the Virginia House by 3 points. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since partisan lean represents our best guess of how a district would vote in a neutral political environment, this implies that the nation currently leans toward Republicans by 6 or 7 points. If that holds true a year from now, the 2022 midterms would be a veritable red wave. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, we don’t yet know the partisan leans of all the House districts that will be on the ballot next year, because most <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still haven’t been drawn</a>. But just for illustrative purposes, if Republicans won every district in the current House map<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e., the one used in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> that has a partisan lean redder than D+7, they would flip 47 seats en route to a 260-175 majority. And if every state with a partisan lean redder than D+7 votes Republican for Senate next year, the GOP would flip five seats: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado. (This obviously ignores other potentially important factors like candidate quality; it’s just meant as an illustration of how impressive Republicans’ performance was on Tuesday.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be clear, this is probably the <em>worst-case</em> scenario for Democrats, just as this 7-point Republican overperformance in 2021 legislative elections is the worst for Democrats of the handful of midterm indicators we currently have at our disposal. The most obvious piece of counterevidence: Democrats still lead polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> by an average of 2.3 points.<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But if I were the Democratic Party, I’d be feeling less comforted by that number after Tuesday. While polls are usually in the right ballpark, they are still subject to a margin of error, as Democrats themselves discovered in 2020, when the generic-ballot polls <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overestimated their margin</a> by 4.2 points. Plus, there was already good reason to think that generic-ballot polls right now are overestimating Democrats: Almost all so far have surveyed registered voters rather than likely voters, who tend to be a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Republican-leaning group</a>, especially in a midterm election when the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-republicans-really-have-a-big-turnout-advantage-in-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president is a Democrat</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Nothing about 2022 is written in stone, and there’s no guarantee that a red-wave election will come to fruition. But the historical expectation with a Democratic president has always been that Republicans would have a good election cycle, and the evidence for that is mounting. The Republican overperformance in the 2021 elections is simply a reminder of how bad things could get for Democrats.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">This is a tale of two pastors and two mass shootings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a balmy June evening in 2015, a young man with a blunt bowl haircut walked into the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/south-carolina-mother-emanuel-ame-church.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in Charleston, South Carolina, to join a Wednesday night Bible study. As the worshipers closed their eyes in prayer, the man fired at least 70 shots, killing nine people. Among the dead were Ethel Lee Lance, the mother of the Rev. Sharon Risher, and two of Risher’s cousins.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Two years later, on a bright Sunday morning in November, a man in a skull face mask fired some 700 rounds outside and inside the <a href="http://ssfb.net/site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs</a>, Texas, leaving at least 20 people injured and 26 dead. A pregnant woman, her unborn baby and the 14-year-old daughter of the church’s pastor, Frank Pomeroy, were among those killed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is also a tale of two very different responses to tragedy and trauma. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both pastors buried their dead, mourned their incalculable losses, read their Bibles, prayed and eventually returned to their ministries. But Risher, a nondenominational Christian pastor, dedicated herself to gun-law reform and reducing access to weapons. Pomeroy, a Southern Baptist, armed and trained his church members and routinely wears his weapon in the pulpit.</p>

Sharon Risher, flanked by Democratic senators at the U.S. Capitol, joins other survivors of gun violence to call for gun control. <p>Win McNamee / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“To me, being a follower of Jesus means that I will always advocate for nonviolence,” Risher told me from her home in Charlotte, North Carolina, just a few days after the sixth anniversary of her mother’s murder. “My thinking is, I don’t condemn anyone for owning a gun, but I want people to realize the power of the violence they hold in their hand when they have a gun. And that just because you have a right to own a gun does not mean you have to exercise the right to use it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pomeroy, who has a military background and grew up hunting, sees carrying a gun as an extension of his responsibility to protect his flock. He is both licensed and trained to use a handgun and often carried one before the shooting at his rural church.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“God has endowed some of us with the capability to be a warrior and others not,” he said, sitting at his dining room table during a video interview. “Some are on the frontline, and some are in the supply room. Both are equally important, but they’re gifted in different ways. And that’s why it’s important that we go to the Lord and seek what we’re supposed to do individually. And then if he says, yes, carry that firearm, I have no problem carrying that firearm.”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg" alt="Pastor Frank Pomeroy" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302756572515.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who wears a gun in the pulpit, preaches to his Sutherland Springs, Texas, congregation in 2020. <p>Josie Norris / The San Antonio Express-News via AP</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">How did these two Christian leaders come to such opposite conclusions? Both read the same Bible, worship the same God and have suffered unfathomable losses to unspeakable violence at the hands of disturbed individuals who managed to acquire legal firearms. Yet on the issue of guns, there is a gulf between them. And, perhaps what’s most important, Risher’s and Pomeroy’s dividing paths highlight two very different relationships between guns and God in America today.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans’ passion for the right to bear arms has a long and well-known history. But the relationship between religion and guns is often obscured by the horror and tragedy of mass shootings like those that terrorized the Charleston and Sutherland Springs congregations. However, activists, scholars and pastors now point to a shift in the relationship between religion and guns, with more people of faith realizing that despite a range of views on the proliferation and use of guns, they have a theological and moral imperative to speak out on the issue. Even so, security-training companies say houses of worship make up the fastest-growing segment of their business as more churches, synagogues, mosques and temples are arming their congregations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The cross and the gun give us two really different versions of power,” said Shane Claiborne, a Christian activist and co-author of “<a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/beating-guns/388781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beating Guns: Hope for People Who Are Weary of Violence</a>.” “One of them says, ‘I’m willing to kill,’ and the other one says, ‘I’m willing to die.’”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As a pastor who owns and carries a gun, Pomeroy is not an outlier. Few studies examine gun ownership and religion, but scholars who have explored the subject see a definite link.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Religion does matter to gun ownership, but not in any one simplistic way,” said David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University who found that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312410212_Awash_in_a_Sea_of_Faith_and_Firearms_Rediscovering_the_Connection_Between_Religion_and_Gun_Ownership_in_America_FAITH_AND_FIREARMS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evangelical Protestants were more likely to be gun owners</a> compared with mainline Protestants, members of other religions and people with no religious affiliation. “The connection between gun ownership and religion is different depending on whether you are talking about religious behaving, belonging or believing.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yamane found, for instance, that Americans who hold more theologically conservative beliefs are more likely to own guns, but those who are more actively involved with their house of worship’s congregation are less likely to own guns. “These differences are essential to keep in mind if we want to have an accurate understanding of the connection between religion and guns,” he said.</p>

Today, only three states and Washington, D.C., prohibit firearms inside places of worship, according to the Giffords Law Center.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Overall, shootings in houses of worship are rare, but they are becoming more frequent. According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database published by The Washington Post</a>, 95 people have died in a mass shooting at a place of worship in the U.S. since 1966, and more than half of those people were killed in the past five years.<a data-footnote-id="10" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures are up-to-date as of May 12 and represent shootings where four or more people were killed and exclude shootings connected to robberies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a> The impetus for these rampages ranged from domestic disputes — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tessa-brennaman-devin-kelley-sutherland-springs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the motivation of the Sutherland Springs killer</a> — to religious- or race-based hatred — the Mother Emanuel shooter <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dylann-roof-confesses-church-shooting-says-he-wanted-start-race-war-344797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped to start a race war</a>.

A member of the church’s security team, licensed to carry, shot and killed the perpetrator. The incident was captured during live video streaming of the service and has been watched on YouTube and Twitter millions of times.</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">After every shooting, religious leaders appear in the media and call for peace and unity. Some, like Risher, call for “common-sense gun laws,” a term proponents of these measures prefer over “gun control,” which they say has a negative connotation. Others, including the Rev. Robert Jeffress, a member of former President Donald Trump’s faith advisory board, have no problem with their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/11/06/after-texas-church-massacre-a-push-for-armed-guards-and-gun-packing-parishioners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flock bringing guns to church for greater safety</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">"I'd say a quarter to a half of our members are concealed-carry — they have guns and I don't think there's anything wrong with that,” <a href="https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/927532536175009792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffress said on “Fox and Friends”</a> after the Sutherland Springs shooting. “They bring them into the church with them ... if somebody tries that in our church, they might get one shot off or two shots off, and that's the last thing they'll ever do in this life.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="http://ryanburge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Burge</a>, a professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University and an American Baptist Church pastor who has studied guns and religion, finds that political affiliation is a stronger indication of one’s views on guns than religion is, with Republicans more likely to support less legislation and Democrats in favor of more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gun control is a fascinating issue in American faith, because the data points to a clear conclusion,” <a href="https://religionunplugged.com/news/2020/7/2/party-politics-more-than-religion-drives-views-on-gun-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he wrote in 2020</a>. “Religious leaders are, by and large, not guiding the views of their congregations on this topic ... Americans of all religious faiths are less supportive of gun control now than at any point in the last two decades.” </p>

Cory Booker to speak about gun violence and its connection to white nationalism. <p>Randall Hill / REUTERS</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">On the organizational level, most denominations have made statements against gun violence — and sometimes, against guns themselves — especially after mass shootings. But only the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has ordained a “<a href="https://www.presbypeacefellowship.org/first-minister-of-gun-violence-prevention-ordained-in-the-united-states-presbyterian-rev-deanna-hollas-of-dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minister of gun violence prevention</a>,” the Rev. Deanna Hollas, who lives in a religious community outside Dallas.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hollas felt called to this role when her daughter attended a Texas college that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/us/texas-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-guns-on-campus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows students to carry weapons on campus</a>. Now she visits mainline Protestant churches across the country to speak out against gun violence and perform “disarmings” — the dismantling of firearms per Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives guidelines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Not everyone is going to lay down their guns,” she said. “But we are going to say there is a different way.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While Hollas is the only known minister exclusively assigned to work on gun violence, she believes that more people of faith are taking up the issue.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The good news is people are waking up to this,” she said. “Sight is being restored to the blind. The tools we have been using — that we are going to read and think our way out of gun violence — have not been effective. We are in the process of deconstructing that and realizing that we need to return to spiritual practices and embrace the faith of Jesus instead of the church of empire that we have inherited.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Increasingly, religious leaders in favor of gun reform are framing their argument as anti-violence rather than anti-gun. Among these are Claiborne, the Philadelphia-based leader of <a href="https://www.redletterchristians.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Letter Christians</a>, a faith-based organization that emphasizes the words of Jesus — which are printed in red letters in some Bibles — to oppose gun violence and other societal ills. Clairborne was raised in a hunting and gun-owning family but now travels the U.S. literally beating surrendered guns into garden tools and other implements.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We're worshipping the Prince of Peace on Sunday and packing heat on Monday, sometimes even packing heat on Sunday,” he said a few days before traveling to Houston to dismantle guns collected by a local congregation. “Some of our idolatry of individual rights is at the heart of this too.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Claiborne knows Christians who carry guns and bring them to church — <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/guns-in-public/location-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 states have no restrictions on doing so</a>. He said he understands Pomeroy’s decision to arm himself and his congregation but added that this doesn’t align with his understanding of the same faith.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It's very reasonable to do what the pastor at Sutherland Springs did,” he said, noting that he does not know Pomeroy and does not want to judge him. “In fact, it's exactly what [Jesus’ disciple] Peter wanted to do when he picked up a sword to try to defend Jesus, and Jesus says, ‘<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18:10-11&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Put your weapon away</a>.’ For me, as a Christian, there’s no way that I can reconcile Jesus’ call to love our enemy with this idea that we’re going to stand our ground or kill our enemy.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That is Risher’s conclusion, too. She said she has forgiven her mother’s murderer. “If I did not, it was going to eat me alive,” she said. “And I wanted to live. And I did not want to live as a victim.” Now she travels the country to encourage other people of faith to put down any weapons they may own.</p>

Yes, God gives us prayer, but he gives us the motivation and the willingness to take action.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Claiborne’s actions have included organizing a <a href="https://www.redletterchristians.org/death-be-not-proud-the-easter-gospel-of-non-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peaceful protest and demonstration</a> outside a Philadelphia gun store. Risher volunteers with <a href="https://www.everytown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everytown for Gun Safety</a> and <a href="https://momsdemandaction.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>. Catholic priests, <a href="https://isna.net/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muslim imams</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RabbisAgainstGunViolence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jewish rabbis</a> and other <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/opinion/kaur-oak-creek-anniversary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religious leaders</a> have walked the streets of cities plagued by gun violence in the hope of interrupting the violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.pastormikemcbride.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rev. Michael McBride</a> is one of those pastors. As director of the <a href="http://www.livefreeusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Free Campaign</a>, an anti-violence and anti-mass-incarceration activist group, he and a cadre of San Francisco-area clergy routinely walk the streets of Oakland and other Bay Area cities where gun violence is routine. They do not focus on gun legislation, but on actions they hope will “interrupt” the cycle of violence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Gun control is one part of the conversation, but too many people in the gun-control community want gun control to be the lion’s share of the conversation,” he said. “I think at best it should be 25 percent of the conversation.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McBride, who grew up in Hunter’s Point, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Troubling-trend-in-San-Francisco-32-jump-in-15585017.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a hot spot for gun crimes in the Bay Area</a>, came to this work after seeing the results of gun violence up close. “Once you do a dozen funerals … it changed me,” he said. “I asked, ‘Is this the most that I could do?’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now his group holds “call-ins” — mediated conversations between gun offenders, faith leaders, crime victims, ER nurses and police — and organizes 12-month programs for gun offenders, or “peace cohorts,” that focus on working them into their communities. Gun-control legislation, he said, rarely comes up as a viable solution to urban gun crimes, especially when he is facing an anguished mother who wants to know why her son or daughter was shot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The church, McBride said, should be an advocate for “common-sense gun legislation,” but it cannot end there. People of faith must also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675720305507?casa_token=fLGjlYBOxMMAAAAA:_0PBeCWDM99QcYDnSe1vHJz4YFrrHAIlUVyTXTXckYwyiL6jqoNnldTlOAWF50wdTNIc6cqe_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look at the causes of the violence</a> — income inequality, mass incarceration, mental-health issues and trauma, among them.</p>

We have to scale up intervention to change lives.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s a tall order for anyone, clergy or layperson. Shani Buggs, a professor at University of California, Davis’s <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/vprp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violence Prevention Research Program</a>, said while some clergy are involved in violence-interruption programs, very few actively promote gun-reform laws.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s a complicated issue for them,” she said. “It has become increasingly political.” And politics is often considered taboo in houses of worship, which can lose their tax-exempt status if they engage in campaigning — not to mention lose members who may disagree.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No one knows this better than <a href="https://www.revrobschenck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rev. Rob Schenck</a>. Schenck spent 20 years as a very public activist for <a href="https://www.operationrescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Rescue</a>, the conservative Christian anti-abortion-rights group known for their graphic protests at women’s health clinics. He was also the president and founder of <a href="https://faithandlibertydc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faith and Action</a> (now Faith &amp; Liberty), a Washington, D.C., organization, which according to Schenck had 55,000 donors and a $2 million annual budget; the group’s aim was to increase Christianity’s influence on the U.S. government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But in the 2010s, Schenck had a change of heart on abortion, same-sex marriage and guns — three issues central to evangelical identity. In 2018, he resigned from Faith and Action over differences about his anti-gun mission. He then founded <a href="http://www.tdbi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dietrich Bonhoeffer Institute</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to the German cleric’s theology and ethics, which Schenck says has 4,000 donors and a $400,000 annual budget.</p>

Rob Schenck speaks at a press conference ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings to call on the Senate to pass gun-reform legislation. <p>MANDEL NGAN / AFP via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Schenck is not daunted by the change. Instead, he uses his experience inside the evangelical world to talk to conservative pastors and congregations about their affinity for guns. Drawing on his time in Operation Rescue, he frames his argument as an extension of the pro-life movement.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I’m not the first one to have this thought, but the right to life does not end when the baby is born,” he said from his office in Washington, D.C. “That’s the way to find common ground with Catholics, with Jews, with Muslims, with conservatives, with liberals, with conservative Christians, progressive Christians, mainline Christians.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s still a hard sell. Schenck was the main subject of the 2015 documentary “<a href="https://www.armoroflightfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Armor of Light</a>,” which shows him trying to convince a room full of white evangelical clergy to join his side of the gun issue. They stare back at him as if he had asked them to fly to the moon and back.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“When I look into the eyes of those folks, I think they really genuinely believe that God wants them to own a gun,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Schenck has hope. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young evangelicals like Claiborne are more open to questioning and reframing the church’s relationship with guns than their parents or grandparents were. “They’re more skeptical about the Second Amendment and the pro-gun culture and more serious about what Jesus literally said,” said Schenck. “They think this question is worth looking at.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/gun-ammunition-stores-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBISWorld</a>, an industry analyst, Americans spend $15 billion in gun stores annually. That includes everything from firearms and ammunition to cases, safes, apparel and accessories.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many of these products link religion — most often Christianity — to the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. Go to Amazon, Etsy, Walmart or any major retail chain and you will see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raised-Protected-Glory-Pullover-Hoodie/dp/B08LM9B9Z3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothes</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1084793373/god-guns-trump-flag?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=flag+God+and+guns&amp;ref=sc_gallery-1-1&amp;plkey=a6cebffcb82cbe09b2ca445123b431fa4bf27135%3A1084793373&amp;frs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flags</a>, <a href="https://shopgodandguns.com/products/signature-charm-bracelet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charm bracelets</a>, <a href="https://www.hobbylobby.com/Home-Decor-Frames/Mirrors-Wall-Decor/Quote-Wall-Art/God-Guns-Guts-Metal-Wall-Decor/p/80826976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wall plaques</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/130566652931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license plate holders</a> and just about everything else available with symbols and slogans declaring fidelity to God and guns. One company called Tactical Baby Gear sells a patch emblazoned with <a href="https://tacticalbabygear.com/products/god-gods-diaper-patch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“God, Guns &amp; Diapers”</a> under the outline of an AR-15-style assault rifle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Schenck likes to bring out a black-bound, leather Bible cover that opens up to reveal not the usual tissue-thin pages but a 9mm Glock — a gun literally wrapped in the word of God.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In our defense of the Second Amendment,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrTkCPw1CQY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schenck asks in a video</a> as he holds the Bible-as-gun-case, “are we in fact violating the Second Commandment?” In Protestant faiths, that commandment is “Thou shalt not make any graven image.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And dozens of companies, from small mom-and-pop outfits to national organizations, offer security and firearms training specially tailored for pastors, ushers and greeters, and for teams of armed “guardians” or “gate keepers.” Agape Tactical offers a “<a href="https://agapetactical.com/services/warrior-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warrior Women</a>” class for armed women in the pews and quotes the biblical book of Proverbs on its website: “A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.” One pastor <a href="https://circuit-magazine.com/church-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Circuit Magazine</a>, “Church security is becoming the business of the church.” </p>

In 2015 — the year of the Mother Emanuel shooting — he said Strategos did church training sessions in 30 houses of worship. Now they do 300 annually, a number that spiked dramatically after the Sutherland Springs massacre<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/mass-shootings-church-synagogue-temple.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Strategos, which is Christian in its mission and has since conducted training at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, approaches its work like a ministry. Instructors and trainees pray and sometimes worship together.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We believe humility breeds capability,” he said in a phone interview from Kansas City, Missouri, where he is based. “I think you can tell how powerful somebody is by how gentle they are.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In its two-day church training workshops, Strategos teaches that the use of guns is a sort of last resort, Young said. First, they focus on awareness and prevention — strategically placing greeters in the parking lot, training ushers to spot erratic behavior, reconfiguring the church’s locks and other existing safety measures and — most importantly, Young said — verbal de-escalation methods.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We choose who we certify to carry, not the church,” Young said. “They must have a mindset for safety. If they don’t exhibit the right frame of mind” — for example, if they are too eager to shoot or too nervous to shoot — “then we won’t certify them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Young said Strategos declines to certify 2 to 5 percent of trainees because they do not pass this kind of “spiritual gut check.” And the majority — 85 percent — of its church workshops do not include guns, Young said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We will do it [gun training] if they ask,” Young said. “But I would rather a church have an unarmed security team that is trained than an armed security team that is untrained.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Like everyone else in this story, Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs looks at the relationship between guns and religion through the prism of his own experience. And that extends to losing members of his own congregation, including his daughter, to a disturbed man with a semi-automatic rifle.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the media frenzy that descended on his white-walled church after the violence, Pomeroy feels he and other licensed, gun-carrying Christians have been unfairly portrayed as “ignorant hillbillies.” The decision to carry a gun in the pulpit, put about 20 of the church’s 187 members through security training and ensure 10 of them are armed every Sunday morning was made after prayer and reflection, he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He thinks it is a mistake to spiritualize a gun — an inanimate object — and likens his <a href="https://www.kimberamerica.com/pistols/micro-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kimber Micro 9 handgun</a> to the automated external defibrillator that hangs on the church wall. The spiritual question isn’t whether it should be there, but how it should be used.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The only spiritual aspect of this is the human condition,” Pomeroy said. “A person who wrongfully uses firearms to take a life has deeper issues than the firearm. They have sin problems and issues that need to be addressed on a spiritual level. The firearm itself is not the problem, it's the people holding those firearms.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Today, First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs meets in a brand-new building. The old church was clapboard, and the shooter shot through its walls. The new building, which opened its doors in May 2019, is fortified limestone with sanctuary doors that can be locked at the press of a button.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pomeroy hopes he never has to use his gun inside his church (he was away in Oklahoma City on the day of the shooting). Today he speaks publicly in other churches and on panels about church security. Sometimes people on the panel oppose him, which he welcomes as a means to de-escalate the political polarization in America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When told about the Rev. Sharon Risher and how she came to a completely different understanding of guns through the lens of their shared Christianity, he said he would be open to talking to her about their shared experience as grieving survivors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“If we don’t have an open mind and come to the table to have a conversation about it, then there’s no way to ever win,” he said. “And it isn’t about winning. It’s about doing what is best for people.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“And I would pray for her,” Pomeroy adds. “Not to change her mind so much as that hopefully myself or someone like me is there to protect her when we’re needed because she wouldn't be able to protect herself.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Despite what you may have heard, Virginia can still be a purple state. Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-glenn-youngkin-projected-win-virginia-governors-race/story?id=80864529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia’s gubernatorial contest</a> on Tuesday, becoming the first Republican to win a statewide office in Virginia since 2009. As of Wednesday morning, Youngkin led by around 2.5 percentage points — pretty much in line with <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what pre-election polls showed</a> and good enough to become the Old Dominion’s next governor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Coming into the election, FiveThirtyEight put together benchmark margins in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_counties_in_Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all 133</a> of Virginia’s counties and independent cities based on <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2020 election result</a> to provide a road map to show which way the race was trending as the votes came in.<a data-footnote-id="13" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, we uniformly adjusted the 2020 margins to comprise a tied, 50-50 race &lt;em&gt;statewide&lt;/em&gt;. That way, the county-level margins marked what Youngkin or McAuliffe needed to beat in any particular county or independent city to win overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>13</sup></a> And we can use those now, with almost all the votes counted, to unpack how Youngkin won. In the near-final analysis, Youngkin prevailed by outperforming those benchmarks in most parts of the commonwealth — and beating former President Donald Trump’s performance in every locality in the state. The map and table below lay out how each county and city voted compared to the benchmarks, and they show the relative breadth of Youngkin’s gains.</p>

 <p>Vote margin calculated based on the two-party vote, which uses just the Democratic and Republican vote totals. Together, the share of the statewide vote and the benchmark margins produce a 50-50 tie, so performance relative to these benchmarks could signal which party is performing better on election night.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Performing well in the suburbs, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/trump-broke-suburbs-gop-virginia-516412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump struggled</a>, is key to unlocking Virginia, and Youngkin made serious inroads in those parts of the state. Take Loudoun and Chesterfield counties, two of the largest suburban counties in the state. Loudoun, which sits outside of Washington, D.C., still went for McAuliffe by about 11 percentage points, but that marked a huge deterioration for Democrats in comparison to Biden’s 25-point edge there last November. This was an example of Youngkin not necessarily needing to win a fairly blue municipality, but doing enough to cut the margins to help his cause overall. Chesterfield, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/election-2020/democrats-flip-chesterfield-blue-for-first-time-in-72-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditionally been a Republican-leaning county</a> that sits just south of the state capital of Richmond. Biden won it by about 7 points in 2020, but Chesterfield returned to its formerly red ways as Youngkin carried it by close to 10 points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Conversely, the main areas where Youngkin didn’t improve as markedly (and ran behind our benchmarks) tended to be very red localities in the western part of the state. But Youngkin still won all those strongly Republican places by huge margins anyway, outperforming Trump. And as land, rocks and trees can’t vote, Youngkin’s tremendous showing in the more populous parts of Virginia really gave him his victory on Tuesday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With the sizable shifts toward the GOP across the commonwealth, Virginia’s result wasn’t just about Youngkin, however. One inescapable fact about this election is that it took place in an environment that was favorable to Republicans. There’s no better indicator of that than President Biden’s poor approval rating, which stood at about 43 percent coming into Election Day in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>. Republicans were already more likely to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show up in reaction</a> to having a Democratic president, and Biden’s struggles likely turned off some independent voters, too, as the exit poll found they went for Youngkin by 9 points, 54 percent to 45 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Youngkin improved on Trump’s performance with white voters (both men and especially women), who also made up a bigger share of the electorate this year compared to 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia exit polls</a>. White Virginians accounted for 74 percent of voters, up from 67 percent last year. In particular, Youngkin did significantly better than Trump among white women with “some college or less,” per the exit polls: He carried that group 75 percent to 25 percent, greatly improving on Trump’s 56 percent to 44 percent performance with them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The simplest way, though, to describe how Youngkin won is basically that he just performed better across the board, and did so via both turnout and vote choice. At least according to the exit polls (which aren’t always reliable, so we’ll be looking at this question in other ways in the coming days), the electorate that turned out in 2021 was older and whiter than the one that turned out in 2020, and more friendly to Republicans in other ways. And Youngkin improved on Trump’s performance with a host of demographic groups across that electorate.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, just over 3.3 million Virginians cast a ballot, which works out to around 52 to 53 percent of the voting-eligible population -- record turnout for a modern Virginia governor’s race. If the competitiveness of the 2020 presidential election with <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTIONS/oakvendenpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest turnout</a> since women got the right to vote didn’t convince you that Republicans can benefit as much or even more from high-turnout elections than Democrats, perhaps the Virginia election will be the nail in the coffin for the belief that high turnout is only good for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The support Youngkin attracted also materialized down the ballot at a similar rate, too, as the Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/statewide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won nearly identical shares of the vote to Youngkin</a> (as of this writing, only the lieutenant governor race <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/winsome-sears-voted-virginias-next-lieutenant-governor-first-woman-to-hold-position" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been projected for the GOP</a>). The similarity in results is unsurprising in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarized age</a> with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wasnt-that-much-split-ticket-voting-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little ticket-splitting</a>, and those factors appear to have potentially given <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans the edge in the Virginia House of Delegates</a>, too, as they led 51 seats to 49 seats in still-to-be-finalized results.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the wake of this victory, many Republicans are sure to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2021-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embrace the campaign strategy and chief issues</a> that Youngkin used in his victorious effort. That means trying to straddle being pro-Trump but not so Trump-y that you repel suburban voters, while also talking about “education” and the economy. (For a discussion of how education became an umbrella term that includes race, racism, COVID-19 school closures and more, please <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2021-elections-live-updates-and-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our election live blog</a>.) The exit polls in Virginia found those were the two most important topics for voters, with Youngkin winning voters who prioritized those issues by a little more than 10 points. This approach is not guaranteed to work for every Republican candidate in 2022, but it could be a useful road map for them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-virginia-governors-race-is-not-a-good-political-barometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t know with absolute certainty</a> that the Virginia race is a harbinger of things to come in the 2022 midterm elections, but the result does show how damaging an electoral environment like the current one could be for the Democrats next year. History suggests they, as the party that holds the White House, have a hard road to keep control of Congress in 2022, but the Virginia race demonstrates how even seemingly winnable races could be lost if Biden remains as unpopular as he is now. How much Biden rights the ship of state in the coming months will be critical to determining just how ripe of an environment Republicans have next year.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On Wednesday, gun rights is <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-bruen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back at the Supreme Court</a> for the first time in over a decade. The justices will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/us/supreme-court-gun.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighing the constitutionality of a New York law</a> that imposes limits on carrying guns outside the home, setting up a showdown over just how far the Second Amendment goes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Depending on what the justices do, this case could have a <em>much</em> bigger impact on Americans’ lives — and the fate of gun regulations more broadly — than the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-second-amendment-didnt-protect-your-right-to-own-a-gun-until-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court’s last blockbuster gun rights decision</a>. Although that decision, released in 2008 as part of a case called <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, profoundly shifted the law around the Second Amendment by determining that the amendment covered the personal right to own a gun, it directly affected only a handful of gun restrictions. And <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research conducted over the past 10 years</a> hasn’t found a big shift in how lower courts are interpreting the Second Amendment; few gun laws have been struck down as a result.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That could change this time. At a minimum, striking down the New York law would likely result in changes to concealed-carry regulations in at least <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2021/05/supreme-court-gun-rights-concealed-carry-new-york-corlett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six other states</a>, which could mean more guns on the streets of the nation’s two biggest cities. And if the court’s conservative majority decides to issue a more sweeping decision, this case could also open the door for a flood of challenges to other gun restrictions.</p>



<h2><strong>The last big gun rights ruling left lots of restrictions in place</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Supreme Court’s ruling in Heller was undeniably a big deal, at least symbolically. For more than 200 years, the federal courts had approached the Second Amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-ii/interps/99" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a right that belonged to a “well-regulated militia”</a> as outlined in the Constitution — not an individual person’s right to own a gun. But colonial-era militias faded away relatively quickly, which made it pretty much impossible for anyone to successfully argue that their Second Amendment rights were being violated, according to <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/dmiller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darrell Miller</a>, a professor at Duke University School of Law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That changed after 2008. In the Heller ruling, a five-justice Supreme Court majority said that focusing on the militia was a misunderstanding of the core meaning of the Second Amendment. Americans did possess an individual right to carry guns in defense of their home, much as gun rights advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/nra-second-amendment-guns-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been arguing</a> for the past few decades. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In his dissent</a>, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens called it a “law-changing decision” and a “dramatic upheaval in the law.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stevens was right — and wrong. Heller <em>was</em> a fundamental change in constitutional rights. “It was a big deal to have the Supreme Court of the United States say to gun rights advocates, ‘Yes, actually, you have a meritorious argument about a Second Amendment right to have a gun in the home,’” Miller said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on a practical level, Heller’s impact was quite limited. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the majority opinion</a>, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stressed that there were still plenty of circumstances in which gun regulations were constitutional. “Nothing in our opinion,” he wrote, “should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/amendment-didnt-protect-gun-2008-fivethirtyeight-80824464</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And over the next 10 years, the decision didn’t revolutionize gun laws. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a study</a>, law professors Eric Ruben and Joseph Blocher analyzed over 1,000 lower-court decisions involving the Second Amendment between June 26, 2008 — when Heller was decided — and February 1, 2016. They found that very few of those cases were successful. In many cases, judges quoted Scalia’s caveat in their opinion, underscoring the fact that they saw plenty of room for regulation within the Heller decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Many people feared or hoped that gun laws would fall like dominoes [after Heller],” Ruben said. But that hasn’t proved to be the case. In fact, Ruben added, “judges of all ideological stripes have been upholding gun laws.”</p>



<h2><strong>But this gun rights case could change regulations across the country</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The case the justices will hear this term, though, directly addresses one of the most important questions left open by Heller: Can states put restrictions on Americans’ ability to carry guns in public for self-defense? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Specifically, they’ll be weighing a New York law that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/26/22364154/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment-new-york-state-rifle-corlett-shootings-kavanaugh-barrett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires applicants for gun licenses to show</a> “proper cause,” <a href="https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-klenosky-v-ny-city-police-dept" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally understood to mean</a> a heightened need for self-defense in the public sphere. At least six other states, including California, have similar laws, which means that striking down the New York regulation would have far-reaching implications. Those states would likely need to modify their restrictions in ways that would allow a lot more people to obtain guns. And that would have an impact on a lot of people, since it’s currently extremely difficult to get a concealed-carry permit in large cities like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-does-it-really-take-to-get-a-concealed-carry-permit-in-new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/los-angeles-sheriff-expand-concealed-weapons-permits-crime-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Gun rights advocates argue that looser regulations on concealed weapons <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-843/184422/20210720153608584_20-843%20tsac%20Arizona%20Missouri%20et%20al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would actually make those cities safer</a>, since everyday people would be in a better position to defend themselves. But there’s a lot of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence suggesting that’s not true</a>. Multiple <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31361355/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> have suggested that a heavily armed populace doesn’t increase safety — in fact, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one study found</a> that relaxing permit requirements was associated with an increase in violent crime.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just the fate of concealed-carry restrictions that could hang in the balance in this case, though. The Supreme Court could issue a far-reaching ruling that not only strikes down New York’s law but also sets out a whole new way of evaluating whether gun regulations are constitutional — calling many kinds of gun laws into question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are clues to how the court could do this <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/07/judge-kavanaugh-and-the-second-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a sequel case to Heller</a> that was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2011, when now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a circuit court judge on the panel. <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DECA496973477C748525791F004D84F9/%24file/10-7036-1333156.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavanaugh dissented</a> from the majority opinion, which upheld a D.C. ban on semiautomatic weapons. He argued that when considering the constitutionality of gun regulations, judges should use an approach that weighs the “text, history, and tradition” of a given kind of law. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the other conservatives could be open to that line of thinking. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-confirmation/2020/10/13/923215778/barrett-an-originalist-says-meaning-of-constitution-doesn-t-change-over-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a self-proclaimed textualist</a>, was skeptical of gun restrictions as a lower-court judge, too, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-barrett-gun-laws/2020/10/10/3845995e-0976-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going so far as to argue</a> in a 2019 dissent that some felons shouldn’t be stripped of their rights to own guns. Justice Clarence Thomas has also been outspoken about his desire to take on more gun cases. In 2018, he dissented from the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear a case about a California gun law, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/thomas-dissents-from-supreme-court-decision-not-to-review-california-gun-law/2018/02/20/342c378e-164d-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling the Second Amendment a “constitutional orphan.”</a> And the third Trump appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has less of a paper trail on gun rights, but <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2017/03/neil-gorsuch-gun-rights-advocates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocates expect him to be sympathetic to textualist arguments</a> — much as Scalia was.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s hard, of course, to predict how the justices will come down in this specific case, and even Kavanaugh’s approach wouldn’t necessarily spell the end of gun regulation, since as Ruben pointed out, gun regulation has existed for a long time in the United States — in fact, the New York law that’s being challenged <a href="https://nypost.com/2012/01/16/the-strange-birth-of-nys-gun-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is more than 100 years old</a>. But it could lead to a lot of complications, since <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/20/opinions/supreme-court-gun-rights-case-lethality-tucker/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guns are much deadlier now</a> than when the Second Amendment was written, and the mass violence that gun regulations are designed to combat <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-09-01/mass-shooting-data-odessa-midland-increase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is itself a modern phenomenon</a>, which could make a historical approach pretty challenging.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as Ruben pointed out, this approach could leave plenty of room for discretion on the part of judges trying to figure out whether gun laws are constitutional, which is important because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-made-the-federal-courts-whiter-and-more-conservative-and-that-will-be-tough-for-biden-to-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the federal judiciary is much more conservative</a> than it was 10 years ago. “Trying to decide whether a modern taser law is sufficiently similar to historical laws on muskets or other weapons — there’s so much subjectivity in that,” he said. More broadly, Americans’ gun rights are also still being worked out in real time. “It’s being articulated and developed for the first time in our lifetimes, and that makes it unique among constitutional rights,” Ruben said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means there’s a lot of room for the new conservative majority to shape gun rights in America going forward — if they can get on the same page about what that should look like.</p>]]></description>

			<title>The U.S. Has A Lot Of Guns Involved In Crimes But Very Little Data On Where They Came From</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In August, police in Pennsylvania and New Jersey <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/acting-ag-bruck-and-ag-shapiro-announce-arrests-of-three-men-charged-with-trafficking-untraceable-ghost-guns-from-pennsylvania-into-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested three men</a> they said were smuggling untraceable guns across state lines.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Prosecutors have charged the men with several crimes related to a scheme in which they allegedly bought unfinished gun parts in Pennsylvania, assembled them into untraceable firearms with no serial numbers and sold them in New Jersey. Police used a confidential informant to buy nine handguns, six semi-automatic rifles, nine large-capacity magazines and a silencer, according to one of the men’s arrest affidavits.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unfinished gun parts that don’t meet the legal definition of a firearm <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/are-%E2%80%9C80%E2%80%9D-or-%E2%80%9Cunfinished%E2%80%9D-receivers-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t regulated</a> under federal law, which <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-individual-need-license-make-firearm-personal-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows</a> people who can legally own guns to build these kinds of untraceable firearms for personal use. But <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/state-laws/ghost-guns-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> is one of a <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/hardware-ammunition/ghost-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handful of states</a> that require privately made firearms to be registered. The men now face multiple charges of breaking that law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The case highlights the problem of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/us/politics/ghost-guns-explainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so-called “ghost guns,”</a> untraceable homemade weapons that can be assembled from kits bought online, in stores or at gun shows — or even 3D printed using plans available online.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re seeing a big increase in them,” Frank Vanore, chief of detectives for the Philadelphia Police Department, said of these homemade weapons.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2019, police in Philadelphia recovered 95 ghost guns, according to data the department shared with FiveThirtyEight. Last year, it was 250. This year is on track to double that, with 389 recovered as of Sept. 10.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That rise tracks with a broader national trend, experts say. But it’s still just roughly 9 percent of the 4,190 guns that Philadelphia police recovered during the same time period this year. Most guns involved in crimes took more well-worn routes, like straw purchasing or theft, Vanore said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vanore said the ways guns were trafficked made it hard to answer basic questions like how many might be stolen each year. Often, he said, police found trafficked guns only after they were used in a crime. Experts who spoke with FiveThirtyEight said there was no clear, national data on how crime guns go from manufacturers and dealers to the black market, how trafficking differed from state to state or even the street price of trafficked firearms in different markets. The <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/following-gun-enforcing-federal-laws-against-firearms-traffickers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent federal report</a> on gun trafficking dates from 2000, and it used data from 1996 to 1998.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden’s administration is looking to change that with a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initial-actions-to-address-the-gun-violence-public-health-epidemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trafficking report</a>, due out next year, that the administration says will be updated annually. Still, Congress has strictly limited what gun data can be released. And even then, federal officials may not have a complete picture of how many crime guns local police recover, nor where they come from, experts say.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Ideal world, what we do is every time a gun is connected to a crime or a violent crime, there’s an exhaustive investigation that connects the dots and sort of traces the path of that gun to that criminal or crime scene,” said Daniel Webster, director of the Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy at Johns Hopkins University. “And the truth is, that almost never happens.”</p>



<h2><strong>Lots of guns but little data</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Any gun can become a crime gun — it just has to be used in a crime. In 2012, Webster and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins looked at 2004 data on where people in state prisons had obtained the gun(s) they used to commit their most recent crimes. And <a href="https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/19/1/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the researchers found</a> that in the 13 states with the most lenient gun laws, about 60 percent of the inmates had been legal gun owners.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies in other states and cities</a> have found that most guns used in crimes were purchased illegally.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are about 400 million guns and about 100 million gun owners in the United States, according to Tom Chittum, the number-two official at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. But Chittum was quick to add, “The vast majority of those [firearms] are never going to be used in a crime.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When a gun is used in a crime, local law enforcement can submit it to ATF for tracing. The bureau then uses the gun’s unique serial number to trace it to the original dealer, which must maintain records of every sale for at least 20 years. In 2019, the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/146976/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average time</a> from when a gun was first purchased to when it was traced by ATF — a metric the bureau calls “time to crime” — was 8.29 years. But that metric comes with a big caveat. Since ATF traces only to the first retail sale, it can’t see if someone bought a preowned gun at a pawnshop and then used it in a crime the next day, for example. The same goes for private sales and trafficked weapons. Any tracing beyond the first sale is up to local law enforcement. In other words, the time-to-crime metric is limited in what it says about where crime guns originate from.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There are some gaps in there, and it’s hard for us to always identify when these things occur,” Chittum said. “But we do what we can with what we have.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The same is true of the handful of <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local, state and federal prison surveys</a> that asked people convicted of crimes involving guns where they got their weapons. Often, Webster said, their answer was “on the street.” But that doesn’t say much about how a weapon got from a legitimate dealer to the street in the first place.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[The surveys] only ask about the most immediate transfer,” Webster said. “And it doesn’t tell you the path which that gun took to get to that individual.”</p>



<h2><strong>How a legal gun becomes a crime gun</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">No expert who spoke with FiveThirtyEight would put a number on the different ways guns wound up on the street, but they did give a breakdown of the major categories. Two of the most prominent are straw purchases and thefts — although ghost guns, the secondary market and failures in the background check system also contribute to the problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The ways that guns are trafficked, though, can make it difficult to know how a firearm wound up in the wrong hands, often by design.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a straw purchase, for example, someone buys a gun on behalf of someone else — either because the real buyer can’t legally own a gun or because they don’t want the gun traced to them. Straw purchasing is <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/10-people-indicted-scheme-%E2%80%9Cstraw-purchase%E2%80%9D-firearms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal under federal law</a>, but it can be tricky to spot since it’s legal to buy a gun as a legitimate gift for someone else — as is selling a gun you own, so long as you’re not “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged in the business</a>” of dealing guns.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Because straw purchasing can be so hard to spot, law enforcement often detects it only once a gun has been used in a violent crime, according to Chittum. “The straws, by their very nature, don’t have any criminal history or any serious criminal history — at least no criminal history that would prohibit them [from legally owning a gun],” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Theft is another major way that guns move to the illegal market. Criminals have been known to use vehicles to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22smash+and+grab%22+%22gun+store%22+truck+OR+car+OR+vehicle&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=896&amp;tbs=sbd%3A1&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=v5Z5YbmrHoH2-gTWkoeYCg&amp;oq=%22smash+and+grab%22+%22gun+store%22+truck+OR+car+OR+vehicle&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i10i160k1.30311.35204.0.35396.12.12.0.0.0.0.316.1658.0j5j2j1.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.7.1485...33i299k1j33i160k1.0.56I4Cj5D7kQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smash through the fronts of gun stores</a>, and ATF said it now had a 100 percent response rate when there was a burglary at a licensed firearms dealer. But thefts from dealers are “a drop in the bucket” when compared to thefts from individuals, Chittum said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Data from the Philadelphia Police Department shows 1,009 guns stolen in 2019 and 1,244 stolen in 2020. This year, the department had recorded 855 gun thefts as of Sept. 10 — on track to meet or exceed last year’s total.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vanore said the city saw a decline in thefts from residences because more people stayed home during the pandemic, yet thefts from cars skyrocketed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other experts say it’s not uncommon for criminals to break into cars outside events that ban weapons — at a stadium, for example — or to target vehicles where there’s some visible indication that the owner might be a gun enthusiast.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Peter Gagliardi is a law enforcement consultant who spent more than two decades as an ATF special agent. He said people sometimes telegraphed that they were gun owners, which allowed criminals to “know where the fish are.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They throw a line in,” he said. “Maybe they catch one, maybe they don’t.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Things get messy when law enforcement sees the same person reporting several thefts over a period of time. Sometimes, straw purchasers will report the guns they buy for other people as stolen to cover their tracks. Those false reports can muddy the data on gun trafficking, but they can also help law enforcement uncover straw-purchasing schemes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As you start to dig into these, you kind of see that the same person reported multiple guns stolen over the last year or two, and that’s when it starts to become somewhat suspicious and we begin to look at it a little more closely,” Vanore said.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/amendment-didnt-protect-gun-2008-fivethirtyeight-80824464</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Then there are ghost guns. Building one isn’t trivial, and 3D printing one can take special skill, as Vice News showed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4dBuPJ9p7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent video documentary</a>. But companies sell kits online that allow people to make fully functional handguns and rifles from their homes with just a few tools, some know-how and a little time. Step-by-step instructions are easy to find on YouTube.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The weapons have been showing up at crime scenes with increasing frequency, too, according to experts — including at least <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/ex-con-who-killed-california-cop-used-homemade-ghost-gun-n1042811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two mass shootings</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/us/saugus-shooting-ghost-gun/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one school shooting</a> in California. ATF is finalizing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-ghost-guns/2021/05/07/0d20ef86-af74-11eb-acd3-24b44a57093a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new federal regulations</a> that would change the definition of a “firearm” under federal law, potentially making it much harder to build an untraceable weapon. But a federal appeals court also <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-lifts-ban-on-3d-printed-gun-blueprints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loosened restrictions</a> this year on digital blueprints for 3D-printed guns, which could make ghost guns more readily accessible.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some crime guns also come from the secondary market — gun shows, online classifieds sites that specialize in firearms as well as other private sales that don’t require a background check under federal law.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, private sales can be hard to distinguish from straw purchases. As Chittum explained, if you meet up with someone in a gas station parking lot to transfer a gun you just bought on their behalf, that’s an illegal straw purchase. But if you buy a gun, decide it was a waste of money half an hour later and offer to sell it to the person at the next gas pump for cash, that’s legal in <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/#footnote_6_4119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most states</a> — federal law doesn’t require a background check for private sales.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, problems with the gun background check system sometimes let people who can’t legally own a gun buy one from a licensed dealer. It’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-people-are-buying-guns-fewer-people-are-getting-background-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impossible to know</a> how many times that happens each year because of how the FBI stores gun background check records. But there have been several high-profile shootings where the shooter bought their weapon because the background check system failed, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/714921726/20-years-on-the-background-check-system-continues-to-miss-dangerous-gun-buyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including</a> the 2017 shooting at a church in Texas, the 2015 shooting at a church in South Carolina and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/714921726/20-years-on-the-background-check-system-continues-to-miss-dangerous-gun-buyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2007 shooting</a> at Virginia Tech.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2019, <a href="https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last year for which data is available</a>, every state and territory was its own biggest source of crime guns that were traced by ATF, with just three exceptions — <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/147311/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puerto Rico</a>, the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/147351/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> and <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/146976/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington, D.C</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That doesn’t mean interstate trafficking isn’t a problem with crime guns, though. In <a href="https://www.atf.gov/file/147286/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, for example, more than twice as many guns involved in crimes came from southern states as came from in-state, following a route known as the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQiKrzUsZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iron pipeline</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During Gagliardi’s time as special agent in charge of ATF’s New York Division, many of the crime guns he saw came from southern states with less restrictive gun laws, he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Heat flows from hot to cold,” he said.</p>



<h2><strong>The gun industry’s role</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">ATF’s 2000 report found that licensed gun dealers were involved in less than 10 percent of its trafficking investigations from July 1996 to December 1998. But that small percentage was responsible for <em>nearly half</em> of all the trafficked firearms the bureau investigated during that period.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, in 2003, Congress <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RS22458.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed an appropriations rider</a> known as the Tiahrt Amendment — named after its sponsor, then-Rep. Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, a Republican — that blocks ATF from releasing gun trace data, except for some official purposes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There hasn’t been a trace report since. The bureau can still release aggregate statistics but not detailed data that could identify corrupt gun dealers, for example.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A lot of this information is hard to get [now], and that’s precisely the intent of the gun industry,” said Rob Wilcox, federal legal director for the gun control group Everytown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The gun industry, though, says it has worked with ATF and individual dealers to crack down on gun trafficking. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the industry, runs a training program for gun dealers and an advertising campaign to discourage straw purchasing, and it provides dealers with resources to prevent thefts. The group also <a href="https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/atf-nssf-offer-reward-gun-store-burglary-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matches ATF’s rewards</a> for information on gun-store burglaries.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Lawrence Keane, the foundation’s senior vice president of government and public affairs, said his group supported increased funding to ATF and the gun background check system, which is operated by the FBI.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You walk into a Republican appropriator’s office and say you want more money for ATF, you get kind of a strange look,” he said. “But we have, and we’ve been successful.”</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Keane said he was skeptical about whether there was indeed a rise in the use of ghost guns for crimes. He’s “never seen the data,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s emblematic of the larger gun debate, where the two sides can barely agree on what the facts are — much less what policies could change them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in Philadelphia, Frank Vanore, the police detective, is worried about how many young people are carrying weapons. The city recently surpassed 400 homicides for the second year in only two decades, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/crime/philadelphia-homicides-record-400-gun-violence-20210926.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. One of those victims, 15-year-old Simone-Monea Rogers, died in August after being <a href="https://www.phillytrib.com/news/local_news/girl-15-who-was-shot-at-north-philly-basketball-court-dies/article_76c48cc3-01f6-5ad6-be58-dabc6673734c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot in the face</a> by a stray bullet while playing basketball on a playground.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Vanore said the incident showed the human cost behind the muddled data and policy debates around gun trafficking — and the need to get more weapons off the street.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They use that gun, their life’s done,” he said. “You know what I mean? They fire that gun, there’s no bringing that bullet back.”<br></p>

<h2>Is Virginia truly a blue state?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Tuesday’s main event will happen in Virginia, where Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin are vying to be the commonwealth’s next governor. And the race is pretty much tied, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s Virginia polling average</a>, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if either candidate comes out on top.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1766" height="1234" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-6.55.57-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">On one hand, the competitiveness of the race is a bit surprising as Virginia has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaned Democratic in recent years.</a> It <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2020&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted for President Biden by 10 points in 2020</a>, and it has elected a Democrat in every statewide election dating back to 2012.<a data-footnote-id="14" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President and U.S. Senate in 2012; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2013; U.S. Senate in 2014; president in 2016; governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2017; U.S. Senate in 2018; and president and U.S. Senate in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> But on the other hand, this D+5 state, according to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean</a>,<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partisan lean is the average margin difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall. This version of partisan lean, meant to be used for congressional and gubernatorial elections, is calculated as 50 percent the state or district’s lean relative to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a> is still very susceptible to shifts in the national environment. And thanks to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unpopular Democratic president in the White House</a>, the electoral environment currently favors the GOP. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Headed into the election, Biden’s approval rating sits at about 43 percent and his disapproval rating at about 51 percent, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker</a>.<a data-footnote-id="16" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a> It’s underwater in Virginia, too. Recent polls from <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2021/10_26_2021_marginals.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=C18DD5B48B481336D2DC949F917376F13E0F8BE2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today/Suffolk University</a>, <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-24-27_Virginia_Topline_October-28-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/29/virginia-governors-race-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post/Schar School</a> found Biden’s approval rating in the mid-to-low 40s. This may galvanize Republicans — who were already more likely to show up at the polls <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2014.944286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in reaction to having a Democratic president</a> — while also potentially <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/10/18/biden-approval-rating-virginia-gubernatorial-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repelling some independents</a> who backed Biden last November. It’s also dampened enthusiasm among Democrats. <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-10-27.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The final poll</a> from Christopher Newport University’s Wason Center found that 80 percent of Republicans were “very enthusiastic” about voting, compared with just 65 percent of Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, this is hardly new territory for McAuliffe. He was in the same position in 2013 when another unpopular Democratic president, Barack Obama, was in the White House. Obama’s approval numbers were nearly identical to Biden’s right now, yet McAuliffe <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2013&amp;fips=51&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still managed to win</a>. In fact, McAuliffe’s victory <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-surprisingly-dramatic-terry-ken-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the first for the president’s party</a> in a Virginia gubernatorial race since the GOP won in 1973, during Richard Nixon’s presidency.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Thanks to Virginia’s one-term limit for elected governors, McAuliffe wasn’t able to seek reelection in 2017, but it’s plausible that McAuliffe should be in an even stronger position this time around, as <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2018-02-07.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he left office popular</a>. Virginia is also <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Democratic-leaning now</a> than it was in 2013. Yet Youngkin looks more formidable than McAuliffe’s 2013 foe, then-state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2013/11/06/terry-mcauliffe-three-reasons-why-he-is-the-new-governor-elect-of-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy to cast as a right-wing ideologue</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-trounces-cuccinelli-in-late-donations-in-virginia-governors-race/2013/10/31/f0749b7a-423a-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t keep pace with McAuliffe</a> in fundraising. Youngkin, meanwhile, is leaning into his appeal as an outsider — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/virginia-republicans-just-gave-themselves-a-chance-to-win-back-the-governorship/2021/05/11/574c545a-b281-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s never run for office before</a> — and <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/amount-raised-statewide-candidates-oct-25-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’s kept up</a> with McAuliffe in fundraising, thanks in part to self-funding from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governors-race-financial-disclosures/2021/07/01/b697b70e-da9c-11eb-9bbb-37c30dcf9363_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immense personal wealth</a> he accrued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/glenn-youngkin-fortune-carlyle-virginia/2021/08/02/aeeebab4-efc5-11eb-81d2-ffae0f931b8f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the finance industry</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Youngkin has also homed in on education in an attempt <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/virginia-governor-youngkin-education-gop-516625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to capitalize on</a> debates over <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how race is taught in schools</a>. His campaign has <a href="https://youtu.be/zafXDPCDsTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run ads criticizing McAuliffe</a> for saying in a recent debate that he didn’t “think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” McAuliffe was defending his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-vetoes-bill-that-would-have-allowed-parents-to-block-sexually-explicit-books-in-school/2016/04/04/8b969316-fa75-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 veto of legislation</a> that would have allowed parents to have their children “opt out” from reading school books with sexually explicit content, but McAuliffe is clearly concerned about Youngkin’s line of attack, as he’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaaavis/status/1450199344863399939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countered with his own ad</a> in which he says he’s “always valued the concerns of parents.” But in an effort not to give McAuliffe the final word on the matter, Youngkin closed his campaign with <a href="https://theweek.com/book-list/1006408/virginia-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-glenn-youngkin-runs-attack-ad-against-toni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ad featuring a woman criticizing</a> McAuliffe’s veto because her son had to read an explicit book in a college-level high school English course. (The ad doesn’t mention the title, but it was Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer-Prize-winning “Beloved,” a novel dealing with the horrors of slavery.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This could pay off for Youngkin, too, as USA Today/Suffolk found that 50 percent of likely voters thought parents should have more influence on school curricula than school boards, while 39 percent said school boards should have more influence. Fox News’s recent poll also found likely voters trusted Youngkin more on education, a shift from <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-10-13_Virginia_Topline_October-14-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two weeks earlier when its poll found</a> McAuliffe narrowly ahead on the issue, while the Washington Post/Schar School survey found the candidates running even on the issue even though voters had previously trusted McAuliffe more than Youngkin in their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-post-schar-poll/2021/09/17/11c4d042-164f-11ec-a5e5-ceecb895922f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early September poll</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, McAuliffe has continued to score better on COVID-19. Virginians are <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_VA_092721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to support vaccine requirements</a> for professions such as teachers and health care workers, and in most polls have said McAuliffe <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_va_102021.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would handle the pandemic best</a>. However, The Washington Post/Schar School’s final survey suggested — to Youngkin’s potential benefit — that the coronavirus has become a less pressing issue since September, as education and the economy clearly led the way as the top issues for likely voters, while the pandemic faded to a distant third.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But McAuliffe isn’t just campaigning on the pandemic; one of his chief approaches has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/virginiagovernortrumptake/2021/10/23/a1975068-340f-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to link Youngkin to former President Trump</a> to motivate Democrats and keep independent voters at an arm’s length from Youngkin. McAuliffe has played up <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-election-ef10f05ada241421ed40e1d1fbf355cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s endorsement of Youngkin</a> and used <a href="https://youtu.be/4eaDAX29ogM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youngkin’s opposition</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mask-vaccine-mandates/2021/08/12/05eb7d70-fad4-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine and mask mandates</a> and the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/mcauliffe-youngkin-virginia-ads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican nominee’s support</a> for supposed “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-race-trump-2020-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election integrity</a>” efforts that question the validity of the 2020 election as evidence that Youngkin is a chip off the old Trump block.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Having won only 44 percent of the vote in Virginia in both 2016 and 2020, Trump has a fairly toxic brand in the commonwealth. And in California’s recent election, Democrats’ efforts to link radio host Larry Elder to Trump do <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-californias-recall-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appear to have helped turn out Democrats</a> to defeat the attempt to recall Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. However, Youngkin doesn’t have Elder’s history of controversial, Trump-esque statements to attack, and California is a far bluer state than Virginia, so <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/politics/analysis-democrats-virginia-governor-election-trump/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-based attacks may not be enough</a> for McAuliffe to edge out Youngkin.</p>

<h2>Is New Jersey’s gubernatorial race competitive?</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It may be positioned in a smaller typeface below Virginia on the Election Day marquee, but the New Jersey gubernatorial election could prove more interesting than we might have expected a few months ago. The contest between incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, had mostly simmered on the backburner as Murphy held polling leads <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/fdu-poll-murphy-leads-a-mostly-unknown-ciatterelli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of more than 10 points</a> in nonpartisan polls <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_081821.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up through August</a>. However, as Biden’s ratings have tumbled, polls suggest <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the New Jersey contest might be a bit closer</a> than it was before, although Murphy remains a substantial favorite to win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, a survey from <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_nj_102721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University</a> — which calls New Jersey home — found Murphy leading by 11 points among registered voters, with the incumbent leading by 8 to 14 points in its likely voter model — a smaller advantage than in Monmouth’s previous polls (9 to 19 points). Additionally, a <a href="https://stockton.edu/hughes-center/polling/documents/2021-1028-stockton-poll-shows-murphy-maintains-lead-over-ciattarelli.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockton University poll</a> found Murphy ahead by 9 points among likely voters, while a <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/news/murphy-retains-lead-builds-momentum-among-independents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairleigh Dickinson University survey</a> of registered voters put Murphy up by 9 points, but the pollster didn’t release a likely voter figure. But another recent nonpartisan survey, from <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/new-jersey-2021-gov-murphy-with-six-point-lead-over-republican-challenger-ciattarelli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIX 11/Emerson College</a>, found a closer contest with Murphy ahead by about 4 points among likely voters.<a data-footnote-id="17" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including undecideds who leaned toward a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a> The latest Monmouth and Emerson polls found Murphy remains more popular than not, however, as Monmouth put his approval at 52 percent and his disapproval at 39 percent, while Emerson found 49 percent had a favorable view of the governor versus 47 percent who had an unfavorable impression.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/buy-us-political-forces-aligned-climate-change-silver-80888230</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Those surveys suggest that Murphy retains a meaningful edge, but they also contain some warning signs for the Democrat. Monmouth’s poll found Biden’s approval rating among New Jerseyans had fallen to 43 percent, while his disapproval rating stood at 49 percent — this in a state Biden carried by 16 points in 2020. And while Monmouth’s polling has consistently found Murphy with strong ratings regarding his handling of COVID-19, the latest poll showed the issue has become less pressing to voters, whereas issues like taxes, as well as jobs and the economy (mirroring a similar trend in Virginia), have become more important. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Murphy doesn’t really have an edge over Ciattarelli on those issues either, as the two candidates ran even on whom voters trusted more to handle jobs and the economy in Monmouth’s polling, with more voters saying they trusted Ciattarelli than Murphy on taxes. Emerson’s poll also showed that 51 percent of voters felt taxes should be the top priority for the next governor, which could work to Ciattarelli’s advantage.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Ciattarelli has an uphill battle ahead of him to actually win, not only because Murphy remains relatively popular and New Jersey is a blue state, but also because his side has fewer resources to work with. Although both candidates took public funding, <a href="https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/gubernatorial/GubPublicFinPP_112020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which severely limited</a> the <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2020/11/we-poured-through-gov-phil-murphys-sprawling-tax-returns-heres-what-we-found.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally wealthy</a> Murphy’s ability to self-fund, outside groups supporting the incumbent governor <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/nj-governor-race-spending-soars-to-nearly-46m-almost-double-from-4-years-ago.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have vastly outspent those backing his GOP opponent</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the campaigns of Murphy and Ciattarelli have each spent around $12.5 million, pro-Murphy independent committees have spent $18.4 million, compared with just $2.7 million by pro-Ciattarelli groups. Most of the spending on Ciattarelli’s behalf comes from the Republican Governors Association, but notably the RGA hasn’t spent much more than it did on behalf of the Republican nominee for governor in Murphy’s initial race back in 2017. That, along with the polling data, still shows Ciattarelli is an underdog — but perhaps he’s not quite as far out of the race as it once seemed.</p>

<h2>What else is at stake in Virginia and New Jersey</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Virginia and New Jersey have more on the line on Tuesday than just their governor’s races, though. Virginians will also be voting for lieutenant governor and attorney general, and what happens at the top of the ticket in the gubernatorial contest will likely have a strong effect on the results in those races. That’s because recent elections have seen very little split-ticket voting, so the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/democratic-domination-in-the-old-dominion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two parties have won similar vote shares</a> across all three contests. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the party that wins the governorship will likely also win the other two positions, both of which Democrats currently hold, although an extremely tight election could produce a split-ticket result. We have limited polling to work with for the lieutenant governor and attorney general races, but the numbers we have seen suggests they are also quite close.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But regardless of the results, some history will be made in Virginia’s statewide down-ballot contests. For starters, its lieutenant governor race will produce the state’s first female lieutenant governor, as Democrat Hala Ayala, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/hala-ayala-lieutenant-governor-virginia/2021/10/15/c10aac82-1d81-11ec-bcb8-0cb135811007_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member of the House of Delegates</a> from northern Virginia, faces Republican Winsome Sears, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/winsome-sears-virginia-lieutenant-governor/2021/10/15/002d1004-26b9-11ec-8831-a31e7b3de188_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">herself a former delegate</a> from the southeastern part of the state. And the pair constitute a historic matchup, as Ayala <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/democrat-hala-ayala-seeks-virginias-first-latina-female-lieutenant-gov-rcna4013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a woman of color</a> who identifies as Afro Latina and works in cybersecurity, while the <a href="https://www.nycaribnews.com/articles/jamaican-born-winsome-sears-vies-for-win-in-virginia-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamaican-born Sears</a> is a Marine Corps veteran and remains the only Black Republican woman to ever be <a href="https://www.localdvm.com/news/capitol-review/one-on-one-with-winsome-sears-republican-candidate-for-virginias-lt-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elected to the House of Delegates</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, the race for attorney general will either produce the state’s first AG to win three consecutive terms <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1929/year_to:2021/office_id:12/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the 1940s</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/miyares-virginia-attorney-general-race/2021/10/22/08da03e4-32c4-11ec-a1e5-07223c50280a_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first Latino to hold the office</a>. Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring is seeking his third consecutive term after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mark-herring-run-attorney-general/2020/09/02/d36714f4-ed41-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandoning an anticipated gubernatorial run</a> following the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-no-one-should-be-surprised-by-democratic-calls-for-northams-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Party of Virginia’s turbulent 2019</a>, when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/virginia-attorney-general-blackface/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herring admitted</a> that he’d worn blackface at a party as a college student in 1980. (This came out after reports revealed Gov. Ralph Northam <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/article_67fdd682-2662-11e9-a7d1-c7ed70e09b50.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had posed in a racist photo for his medical school yearbook</a> in the 1980s and Lt.

But in order to pull this off, he’ll first have to defeat Republican state Del. Jason Miyares, who is Cuban American and a lawyer by trade.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Virginians will also elect the 100 members of the House of Delegates, the lower chamber of the state legislature. (The 40-seat Virginia Senate isn’t up again until 2023.) As things stand now, Democrats hold a 55-to-45 edge in the House, but <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZRfFiCDBEYB7M18fDGLH8IrmyMQGdQKqpOu9lLvmdo/edit#gid=1838276900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Democratic-held seats</a> that the party captured in 2017 and 2019 are competitive and <a href="https://projects.cnalysis.com/21-22/state-legislative/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could now flip back to the GOP</a> in a more Republican-leaning environment. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furthermore, because of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-delayed-census-has-affected-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the delayed release of census data</a> due to COVID-19, Virginia is holding its state House elections <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/census-delays-virginia-redistricting-november-2021-election/291-96095d24-f19c-44f0-80a9-d94f463323df" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under the lines drawn after the 2010 census</a> instead of a new map <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/will-virginia-delegates-have-to-run-again-in-2022-a-judge-could-decide-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflecting the population changes</a> in the 2020 census.

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, New Jersey also has its legislative elections on Tuesday, but there’s not much drama there. Democrats hold a 25-to-15 advantage in the state Senate and a 52-to-28 edge in the General Assembly. <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/the-entire-nj-legislature-is-up-for-grabs-on-election-day-here-are-the-races-to-watch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s little reason to think</a> their majorities in either chamber are under threat.</p>

<h2>The parade of special elections continues</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are also three special elections for Congress taking place on Tuesday. The two general elections in Ohio — one in the dark-blue <strong>11th District</strong>, one in the solidly red <strong>15th District</strong> — are uncompetitive,<a data-footnote-id="18" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-18" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primaries, which you might remember from August, were &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ohios-two-special-primary-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;much more interesting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a> although the winning candidates’ margins will give us more data about whether Democrats or Republicans are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-new-mexico-1st-special-election-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperforming expectations</a> so far in the 2022 election cycle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the primary phase of the special election in <strong>Florida’s 20th District</strong> looks like a jump ball. The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/FL/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Florida district</a>, left vacant by the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-alcee-hastings-civil-right-impeached-judge-congress-obituary-20210406-lnjgt4hokrh3zdzacufao4erqm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of former Rep. Alcee Hastings</a> in April, is extremely blue, so the winner of the Democratic primary is all but guaranteed to win the January general election. However, 11 Democrats are on the ballot, and at least six could plausibly win the nomination. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">No polls have been conducted since July, but health care executive Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is leading the money race, having raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H8FL20032/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.8 million</a> through Oct. 13 — $3.7 million of it from her own pockets. Broward County Commissioner Barbara Sharief has pulled in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20134/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$895,000</a> and has also been <a href="https://friendsofbarbarashariefforcongress.com/press-and-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> by neighboring Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel and a former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Broward County Commissioner Dale Holness, a <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-dale-holness-alcee-hastings-congress-20210412-56aj375pm5g3lacvkduoma6pgi-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close ally of the late Hastings</a>, has also raised <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20159/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$584,000</a>. State Sen. Perry Thurston (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20183/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$458,000</a>) and state House Minority Leader Bobby DuBose (<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20209/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$419,000</a>) round out the top five fundraisers. Finally, state Rep. Omari Hardy has pulled in only <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/H2FL20217/?cycle=2022&amp;election_full=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$172,000</a> but has earned a national following online for his progressive activism.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As always, there are <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/10/06/liberal-moderate-rift-not-a-factor-in-crowded-florida-primary-to-succeed-alcee-hastings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some ideological divisions in the race</a>: For instance, Cherfilus-McCormick (who has the endorsement of 2020 presidential candidate and author Marianne Williamson) and Hardy (who has the endorsement of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee) are pitching themselves as progressives, while Sharief has called herself a “fiscal moderate and a social progressive.” But the race has largely avoided devolving into a proxy war between the left and the establishment. Instead, issues such as <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/08/biden-haiti-migration-refugee-democrats-backlash-state-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. policy toward Haiti</a> (the district is home to many Haitian Americans) have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/23/us-house-races-election-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken center stage</a>.</p>

<h2>Several mayoral races are progressive-moderate showdowns</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you’re looking for left-vs.-establishment proxy wars, though, the nation’s mayoral races have you covered. At least five major cities will choose between a progressive and a more moderate Democrat to be their next mayor.</p>



<ul><li>In <strong>Boston</strong>, <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/massachusetts2/2021/10_19_2021_marginals.pdf">polls</a> have put City Councilor Michelle Wu around <a href="https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2021/10/Crosstabs-2021-10-Boston-Mayor-Mayor-City-Council.pdf">30 points</a> ahead of City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George. Wu, a protegée of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is a <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/18/michelle-wu-boston-city-councilor-mayor-election-chicago">dyed-in-the-wool progressive</a>, while Essaibi George is <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/21/annissa-essaibi-george-mayor-boston-electon">more closely aligned</a> with Biden and former Mayor Marty Walsh (who left city hall to become Biden’s secretary of labor). Either Wu or Essaibi George would be the first woman and the first person of color to be elected mayor of Boston, a city with a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-boston-busing-crisis-was-never-intended-to-work/474264/">sordid history of racism</a> but that has become <a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/32e9b68a-ce1b-41c7-808c-0395cb4f4d19">majority-minority</a>.</li><li>The mayor’s office is also open in <strong>Seattle</strong>, where former City Council President Bruce Harrell is going head-to-head against current City Council President Lorena González. Progressives like <a href="https://lorenaforseattle.com/endorsements/">Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal</a> have lined up behind González, while Harrell was regarded as <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/former-council-president-bruce-harrell-touts-community-roots-strength-and-unity-in-bid-for-seattle-mayor/">more business-friendly</a> during his <a href="https://crosscut.com/politics/2021/10/what-gonzalez-and-harrells-council-votes-say-about-their-mayoral-bids">time on the council</a>. Harrell has taken the <a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2021/seattle-mayor-candidates-mayoral-general-election-guide/">more moderate (though still pretty liberal) positions</a> in this race, too, and he led González in the <a href="https://www.nwprogressive.org/weblog/2021/10/as-voting-begins-in-the-2021-seattle-mayoral-race-bruce-harrell-has-a-sixteen-point-lead.html">most recent poll</a>, 48 percent to 32 percent. González also stumbled in the home stretch when she put out an ad in which a white rape survivor accused Harrell, who is Black and Japanese, of not taking sexual-abuse allegations in city government seriously. Harrell denounced the ad as racist, and González eventually <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/m-lorena-gonzalez-pulls-ad-against-bruce-harrell-that-many-criticized-as-racist-in-final-weeks-of-seattle-mayoral-race/">agreed to stop airing it</a>.</li><li>By contrast, there’s no clear favorite in the race to be the next mayor of <strong>Cleveland</strong>; the <a href="https://www.bw.edu/news/2021/fall/10-justin-bibb-leads-kevin-kelley-in-bw-cri-mayoral-poll-40-still-undecided">two</a> <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/justin-bibb-kevin-kelley-kick-off-general-election-with-endorsements-poll">polls</a> we’ve seen have both been within the margin of error, with around 40 percent of voters undecided. The <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/door-to-door-getting-to-know-justin-bibb-and-kevin-kelley">contrasts in the race are sharp</a>: City Council President Kevin Kelley is a 53-year-old white moderate with the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Frank Jackson, and nonprofit executive Justin Bibb is a 34-year-old Black progressive who has never before run for office. One of the biggest issues in the race has been <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/elections/cleveland-mayoral-election/cleveland-police-reform-proposal-issue-24-still-fueling-debate/95-6f0802e1-2be8-43e6-a84a-f9b9d3001cba">Issue 24</a>, a ballot measure to create a civilian commission to oversee the Cleveland police. Bibb supports it, while Kelley opposes it.</li><li>Passions over policing are still high in <strong>Minneapolis</strong>, too, where Mayor Jacob Frey will face voters for the first time since the murder of George Floyd and the ensuing protests that engulfed the city. With Minneapolitans also voting on local ballot measures to give the mayor’s office more power or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-reform-is-on-the-ballot-in-minneapolis-but-its-about-more-than-defunding-the-police/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-reform-is-on-the-ballot-in-minneapolis-but-its-about-more-than-defunding-the-police/">take the police department out from under its control</a>, the campaign has become a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/public-safety-debate-dominates-mayoral-race/600107324/">referendum on the best way to ensure public safety</a>. Frey has opposed <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/26/minneapolis-council-puts-plan-to-dismantle-police-in-motion">previous efforts to defund the police</a> and attempted to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/20/veto-threat-is-the-latest-wrinkle-in-controversial-mpls-public-safety-ballot-proposal">keep the police-reform ballot measure off the ballot</a>, while his two most prominent opponents, community organizer Sheila Nezhad and former state Rep. Kate Knuth, support the measure and say Frey didn’t do enough to reform policing before Floyd’s death. Nezhad and Knuth have even <a href="https://www.startribune.com/divided-left-field-of-minneapolis-mayoral-hopefuls-have-unified-message-don-t-rank-frey/600107813/?refresh=true">formed an alliance</a>, encouraging their supporters to rank the other second under Minneapolis’s ranked-choice voting system (and not to rank Frey at all). The <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2021/10/an-internal-poll-showed-frey-with-a-19-point-lead-in-the-minneapolis-mayoral-race-but-in-an-rcv-election-he-could-still-lose/">only poll of the race</a> gave Frey 44 percent, Nezhad 25 percent and Knuth 10 percent in the first round, but the poll was conducted by Frey’s supporters, so it’s very possible the race is closer than that.</li><li><strong>Buffalo</strong> is smaller than the other cities here, but its mayor’s race has big drama. Back in June, union representative and democratic socialist India Walton shockingly upset four-term Mayor Byron Brown, 52 percent to 45 percent, in the Democratic primary. But Brown refused to give up his campaign: After a <a href="https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/politics/elections/mayor-byron-brown-loses-court-decision-india-walton-mayoral-race/71-e5ca91fc-610b-4a1a-9b92-226f3b5d6530">failed attempt</a> to make the November ballot as an independent, he is <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/byron-brown-launches-write-in-campaign-for-mayor-as-others-eye-the-race/article_4e459acc-d83f-11eb-b7cb-cb943e248a2a.html">waging a write-in campaign</a> to keep his job. As Walton’s only opponent, Brown is getting support from <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/26/democrat-gets-gop-support-as-write-in-over-socialist-in-buffalo-mayors-race/">local conservatives</a>; some prominent Democrats, such as Gov. Kathy Hochul, have also conspicuously <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2021/10/prominent-new-york-democrats-who-have-not-endorsed-india-walton/186221/">failed to endorse Walton</a>, although <a href="https://www.audacy.com/wben/news/politics/walton-racking-up-major-endorsements-ahead-of-election">she’s received backing</a> from others, such as Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand. As hard as winning a write-in campaign is, Brown may be forming a winning coalition: A recent <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/buffalo-ny-incumbent-mayor-brown-continues-to-lead-mayoral-race-with-write-in-campaign">Emerson College poll</a> of likely voters put Walton at just 36 percent, while 54 percent volunteered that they were voting for Brown. </li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">It doesn’t break down cleanly along ideological lines, but the campaign for mayor of <strong>Atlanta</strong> is also worth your attention. With Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/breaking-atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-wont-run-for-reelection/AOC6CO6TKRGXDLQAZ33XWE2OEQ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shockingly forgoing a second term</a>, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/exclusive-ajc-poll-reed-and-moore-continue-to-lead-in-mayors-race-but-heap-of-voters-still-undecided/WUCSFFNDC5GLTDN6PYMFBRXEVU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling shows</a> former Mayor Kasim Reed and City Council President Felicia Moore leading a 14-person field. Concern over rising crime has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/us/atlanta-mayoral-election-kasim-reed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided an opening for Reed</a>, whose administration was marked by low crime rates but also several scandals, to make a political comeback. But while Reed is the best-known candidate in the race, he is also the <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2021/10/25/atlanta-mayoral-election-polling-sprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most unpopular</a>, and Moore has also <a href="https://www.wabe.org/city-council-president-felicia-moores-plan-to-get-more-atlanta-police-on-the-street/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">echoed his pledge</a> to <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/kasim-reed-we-have-got-to-stop-that-foolishness-in-atlanta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire more police officers</a>, so he is hardly the only choice for voters looking for someone tough on crime. The campaign has also gotten <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/the-race-for-city-hall-the-biggest-issue-facing-atlanta-it-may-depend-on-your-age/N7IXS45WBBC6VMMKWQPG5AUW4Q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exceptionally nasty</a>, with Moore opponents sending anonymous text messages with her personal phone number and Reed opponents accusing him of corruption by photoshopping him into a prison jumpsuit. (Reed’s attorneys have claimed he is not the subject of the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/ajc-exclusive-kasim-reeds-attorneys-say-the-former-mayor-is-not-under-federal-investigation/EMBMXQBFLBDMZDIENEFNP4DHQY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal investigation into city hall corruption</a>.) If no candidate receives a majority on Tuesday, the top two finishers would face off in a Nov. 30 runoff.</p>

<h2>Ballot measures are the icing on the cake</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In odd-year elections, ballot measures are often some of the most interesting races to watch. Unfortunately, 2021 is a bit of a down year for them — perhaps the lingering effects of the pandemic, which also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coronavirus-upends-elections-ballot-access-point-concern/story?id=70288113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowed ballot-measure campaigns in 2020</a>. But there are nevertheless a few worth watching — most obviously, three constitutional amendments over voting rights in <strong>New York</strong>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Proposal 1</strong> would change the state’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex redistricting process</a> to make it easier for the ruling party to pass its desired maps. New York has a bipartisan redistricting commission, but it’s only advisory in nature: The legislature has the final say in either approving the commission’s proposals or simply imposing its own. Under current law, when the legislature is controlled by a single party (as it is currently, by Democrats), a two-thirds supermajority is required to pass any maps. Proposal 1, however, would <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/capital-region/politics/2021/09/24/new-york-s-november-ballot-questions---1---amending-the-state-s-redistricting-process-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower this threshold</a> to a simple majority to pass one of the commission’s maps and a 60 percent majority to impose its own.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Practically speaking, this may not make a huge difference to the current redistricting process, since Democrats already enjoy two-thirds supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. But it could be the difference between a minority party having a seat at the table in future redistricting cycles, and it could also allow current Democrats to gerrymander the state even if they have a few dissenters within their ranks. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Further down the ballot, New Yorkers will find <strong>Proposal 3</strong>, which would <a href="https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2021/09/27/new-york-s-2021-ballot-questions---3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate the requirement</a> that people register to vote 10 days before an election, and <strong>Proposal 4</strong>, which would <a href="https://nystateofpolitics.com/state-of-politics/new-york/politics/2021/09/27/new-york-s-2021-ballot-questions---4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminate the requirement</a> that voters provide an excuse to vote absentee. With voting access increasingly a hot-button partisan issue, New York has gotten a lot of attention for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/nyregion/early-voting-reform-laws-ny.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how restrictive its voting laws are</a>, especially for a blue state. Democrats have been working to liberalize them since taking full control of state government in 2018, but because many of New York’s voting restrictions are enshrined in the state constitution, they couldn’t eliminate them right away. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If these amendments pass, the legislature would be able to pass a law allowing people to register to vote on Election Day (which is one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/opinion/graphics-an-excitingly-simple-solution-to-youth-turnout-for-the-primaries-and-beyond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most powerful election reforms</a> for increasing turnout) and would not need to renew a temporary law (expiring at the end of the year) that added “risk of contracting … a communicable disease like COVID-19” to the list of <a href="https://www.elections.ny.gov/VotingAbsentee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acceptable excuses for voting absentee</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Almost exactly two months after the Supreme Court <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-texass-abortion-law-may-go-too-far-for-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed a novel abortion ban to go into effect in Texas</a>, making it functionally impossible to obtain abortions in the state, the law is back in the justices’ laps. Today, though, the justices won’t directly consider the constitutionality of the ban, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/18/texas-heartbeat-bill-abortions-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which prohibits abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected</a> — often before women know they’re pregnant. Instead, they’ll be grappling with the law’s unique structure, which raises some thorny questions about the federal courts’ power over the states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What Texas did wasn’t noteworthy because of <em>at what stage</em> it banned abortion. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plenty of other states</a> have already passed laws restricting abortion after six weeks, or banning it outright. The Texas law’s innovation was <em>how</em> it banned abortion: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/us/politics/texas-abortion-law-facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Private citizens who successfully sue an individual</a> for helping a woman get a prohibited abortion are eligible for a $10,000 reward, putting responsibility for enforcing the law in the hands of vigilante plaintiffs — and, crucially, taking it out of the hands of state officials, like prosecutors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not clear at this point whether the conservative justices have changed their minds about the Texas law since September. After all, the court recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/us/supreme-court-abortion-texas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose once again</a> to leave the law in place while the legal battle plays out — although it did add the case to its docket at lightning speed, suggesting the justices are looking to make a decision soon. There are signs, though, that the law’s unusual enforcement mechanism may be its undoing: While a majority of justices on the Supreme Court may be willing to reconsider the constitutional right to abortion, giving states the power to pass laws like Texas’s might be a bridge too far even for the court’s conservatives. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It may have dawned on the justices that there’s nothing stopping a state like Massachusetts from passing a similar law on a different issue, like the right to bear arms or free speech on college campuses,” said <a href="https://law.fsu.edu/faculty-staff/mary-ziegler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ziegler</a>, a law professor at Florida State University. And, she added, there are cleaner ways to overturn or limit Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion — including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a case involving a more straightforward Mississippi law</a> that will be heard by the court in December.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At its core, the Texas law is a solution to a dilemma that anti-abortion advocates have struggled with for years. Increasingly, Republican-controlled state legislatures <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2019/03/surge-bans-abortion-early-six-weeks-most-people-know-they-are-pregnant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been willing to pass laws</a> — like a six-week ban on abortion — that openly violate Roe. But with the exception of the Texas ban, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none of those laws are actually in effect</a>, because federal courts <a href="https://time.com/5866714/georgia-heartbeat-abortion-law-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put them on pause</a> while legal challenges played out. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Texas’s innovation was to make it exceptionally difficult for the courts to get involved. Normally, abortion providers sue a state official in charge of enforcing a given abortion law. But by making individuals responsible for enforcement, Texas changed the game — leaving abortion providers with no one to sue, and no obvious way for the federal courts to intervene. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was, as Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/21a24_8759.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in his dissent</a> from the court’s September decision to let the Texas law go into effect, an “unprecedented” approach that was apparently designed to cut the federal courts out of the loop. And it was successful, at least provisionally, since the law is in effect in Texas and, as a result, abortion is currently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-lifestyle-health-travel-texas-fbc505c3db4a08af51ba409a91ea161c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtually impossible to obtain</a> in the state.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But now, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-asks-us-supreme-court-block-texas-abortion-law-2021-10-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced with reviewing a separate lawsuit from President Biden’s administration</a>, the justices have given themselves an opportunity to untangle some of the knottiness of the Texas law — specifically, what role the federal courts have to play. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/22/1047619075/the-supreme-court-keeps-texas-abortion-law-in-place-but-agrees-to-review-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They’re looking at two different questions</a>: whether the federal government can even bring a lawsuit in federal court to stop the law from being enforced, and whether states, such as Texas, can try to create an end-run around the federal courts when constitutional rights are at stake. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to Ziegler, the structure of the Texas law could be a deal-breaker even to justices open to stricter abortion laws, since the law allows a state to functionally override a Supreme Court precedent. That approach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-06/op-ed-how-texas-abortion-law-could-threaten-other-constitutional-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could extend far beyond abortion</a> and be used with other constitutional rights. “Before, Texas looked to be in the clear with this court, and that isn’t the case now,” she said. “That doesn’t mean the state will definitely lose, but the law is in real jeopardy now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, too, this case adds a new layer of complication at a moment that was already very busy and high-profile for the justices. In a few days, they’ll hear oral arguments in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-bruen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the court’s first big gun rights case</a> in over a decade. And then, in early December, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’ll weigh another abortion restriction</a> — a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which could give them the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade. So the back-and-forth over the Texas law might be an unwelcome distraction for the conservative justices, who didn’t need another chance to reconsider whether abortion is constitutional. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s also not a done deal. After all, the Texas law is still in effect, which signals that five of the court’s conservative justices are still unconcerned about abortion’s availability in one of the country’s biggest states, even while Roe v. Wade is still on the books. And in that sense, whatever happens next, anti-abortion advocates in the state have already scored a big victory. By allowing the restriction to go into effect, the Supreme Court permitted the state to effectively ban abortion, forcing women to flood neighboring states to obtain the procedure. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the conservative justices’ willingness to let that happen could signal that anti-abortion advocates are about to win a much bigger victory — even if the Texas law doesn’t ultimately survive.</p>

			<title>Police Reform Is On The Ballot In Minneapolis. But It’s About More Than Defunding The Police.</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">On June 7, 2020, in the wake of the high-profile murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, nine members of the City Council made a public statement: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The police department couldn’t just be “reformed”</a> — public safety in the city would have to be drastically altered. On that summer afternoon, large white letters leaning against the stage spelled out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLWgl-lb9pI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Defund Police.”</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since Floyd’s murder, “defund the police” has become a political catchphrase used to rally supporters and opponents of a policy that is far more complex than the rhetoric suggests. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-like-the-ideas-behind-defunding-the-police-more-than-the-slogan-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unpopular among the American public</a>, it has been used as a bogeyman by Republicans — and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/defying-defund-police-calls-democrat-adams-leads-nyc-mayors-race-2021-06-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some moderate Democrats</a> — to scare voters away from electing progressives as violent crime rates have risen nationwide. (Despite the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/23/defund-the-police-democrats-477609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fears of some Democrats</a>, though, it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/rp_griffin/status/1367950877634535424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unclear</a> whether it has actually <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurt the broader party</a> at the ballot box.) But the slogan can <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/3/21276824/defund-police-divest-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take many forms in practice</a>, from <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-26/lapd-funds-reallocation-george-floyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reallocating part of the police budget to social services</a> to <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/elections/cleveland-mayoral-election/cleveland-police-reform-proposal-issue-24-still-fueling-debate/95-6f0802e1-2be8-43e6-a84a-f9b9d3001cba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting up accountability structures</a>. Often it’s an outright misnomer, simply a way for criminal-justice activists to express their anguish and frustration with the repeated killings of people of color at the hands of police.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Such is the case now in Minneapolis, where on Tuesday voters will decide the fate of City Question 2, a municipal ballot measure that would replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety under the City Council’s control. The debate leading up to the vote shows just how much one idea can take on wildly different meanings. Just like “defund the police,” Question 2 is more than the sum of its parts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Black activists who want to protect their communities from violence look at Question 2 and don’t always see the same risks and opportunities. The Rev. JaNaé Bates, director of communications for Isaiah, a faith-based nonprofit that advocates for social and economic justice, is working with the nonprofit coalition that got Question 2 on the ballot. She’s frustrated that Black Minneapolitans are consolidated into neighborhoods that are underserved and overpoliced and wants to see both of those problems change.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Audua Pugh, the board chair of the Jordan Area Community Council, a neighborhood association on the city’s predominantly Black Northside, said she saw the City Council’s announcement back in the summer of 2020 as a betrayal. To her, Question 2 amounts to a signal that her neighborhood, long ignored by the city and denied infrastructure common in other parts of town, would lose more and not gain anything new. Since Floyd’s death, she has successfully sued the city to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/judge-orders-minneapolis-hire-more-132100293.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demand more police</a> and is a fierce advocate against the ballot question. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That Bates and Pugh — two Black women who share very similar concerns about the dangers posed to their community by both police and criminal gun violence — could end up on opposite sides of a public safety plan says a lot about the divisiveness of Question 2 and the “defund the police” movement generally. The question has roughly split the city in half: Major figures on the left, such as <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ellison-and-omar-support-minneapolis-policing-ballot-question/600092577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Ilhan Omar and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison</a>, support it; major figures of the establishment, such as <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2021/10/21/minneapolis-mayor-jacob-frey-on-major-issues-facing-the-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayor Jacob Frey</a> and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, oppose it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the debate around it has less to do with the actual content of the question than it does with the symbolism. Question 2 is a “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/22/minneapolis-reckoning-defund-the-police-513568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defund the police</a>” proposal that doesn’t actually defund the police. Instead, it hopes to make police more accountable by creating a broader approach to public safety. Except it might not do that either, depending on how other city races pan out. In a contentious election year marked by a citywide increase in gun violence, the proposal has become a way for citizens to express their feelings on a whole range of issues. As Pugh put it, “It’s not what you say. It’s what people hear.” </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At its core, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/31/the-yes-4-minneapolis-charter-amendment-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question 2</a> wouldn’t eliminate the police department, but the city would no longer be required to have a formal police department or minimum police staffing levels that have been mandated <a href="http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/67/v67i05p226-238.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 1961</a>. The question would also create a new Department of Public Safety that could include both police and other kinds of safety officers, such as therapists, social workers or violence interrupters. And the city’s hierarchy would change, too. Right now the MPD is accountable to their chief and the mayor; the new system would have police answering to the head of the Department of Public Safety, who would answer to both the mayor and City Council. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those are the broad strokes, but the fine details remain difficult to pin down, said Jon Collins, a senior reporter for Minnesota Public Radio who has been covering the question and debates around it. The City Council has not been able to publicly discuss plans for implementing the question should it pass, in part <a href="https://twitter.com/KendalKillian/status/1453450195648327686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because the city attorney</a> has <a href="https://m.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-warned-against-using-city-resources-to-advocate-for-policing-ballot-questio/600056497/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned that doing so would violate campaign laws</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, other elections may affect the way the initiative is enacted if it passes. If a lot of the current City Council members lose their seats, that could result in a Department of Public Safety that’s really just the police department, unchanged, under another name. Meanwhile, a separate proposal, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/31/what-to-know-about-the-strong-mayor-ballot-amendment-in-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City Question 1</a>, would give the mayor more power than the City Council. These measures are incompatible, because the council wouldn’t be able to be in charge of the Department of Public Safety under the so-called “strong mayor” system. But it’s very possible both could pass. If so, the issue would likely have to be settled by the state Supreme Court, Collins said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is all intensely technical and wonkish, but it has inspired equally intense division. A <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-poll-public-safety-minneapolis-police-crime-charter-amendment-ballot-question/600097989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September poll</a> conducted by Mason-Dixon on behalf of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Minnesota Public Radio, KARE-TV and the PBS series “Frontline” found that, at the time, 49 percent of likely voters supported Question 2, while 41 percent were opposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The poll gave supporters a lead to go along with their financial advantage — as of Oct. 19, they had raised <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Minneapolis,_Minnesota,_Question_2,_Replace_Police_Department_with_Department_of_Public_Safety_Initiative_(November_2021)#Campaign_finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.0 million versus opponents’ $1.6 million</a>. But the poll also showed opponents within striking distance and showed Question 2 still doesn’t have majority support in the city. That’s important because support for ballot measures often <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/california-election-2020/2019/10/ballot-california-polling-trend-slump-fact-check-myth-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decreases over the course of a campaign</a>, as change-averse voters default to the status quo.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, it also showed that divisions over the question are particularly strong within the Black community. The poll oversampled Black voters in an effort to get a more accurate read on their feelings about public safety in the city. Black voters said they opposed replacing the MPD with a Department of Public Safety, 47 percent to 42 percent (white voters supported it 51 percent to 40 percent). Bates, Pugh and Collins all said they had seen divisions within the Black community along generational lines, with younger people being more likely to support the question and older people (even individuals who have <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/10/14/some-critics-of-mpd-not-sold-on-proposal-to-overhaul-public-safety-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been involved in campaigns for police reform and accountability</a>) opposing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those numbers reflect years of problems between the MPD and Black and brown Minneapolitans. A decade ago, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/02/26/clean-up-strike-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the city shut down its Metro Gang Strike Force</a> after discovering misconduct by police in the elite unit that <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/08/25/strike-force-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included theft</a> and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-third-precinct-served-as-playground-for-renegade-cops/571076562/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battery</a>. Over the past 20 years, the city has paid out <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/investigations/minneapolis-police-misconduct-payouts-top-70-million/89-489d102d-43cc-457e-9f7f-2ce471ccd2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $70 million</a> in misconduct settlements, even as city records show that <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of misconduct complaints against MPD results in no internal discipline</a>. Officers killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of-force.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three other Black men</a> in the five years leading up to Floyd’s death. And in 2007, five high-ranking Black police officers, including the current Chief Medaria Arradondo, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/high-ranking-black-cops-sue-minneapolis-police-department/12081986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the city over racism within the department</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The city, particularly the Northside, is also in the midst of a rapid increase in gun violence. As in most of the country, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/07/27/violent-crime-surges-across-minnesota-with-record-murders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violent crime rose</a> across the state of Minnesota in 2020. There were <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/minneapolis-bloody-summer-puts-city-on-pace-for-most-violent-year-in-a-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">48 murders in Minneapolis in 2019 and 84 in 2020</a>, with some parts of the Northside seeing a 200 percent increase in gunfire. <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/crime/witnesses-say-child-shot-in-north-minneapolis/89-4f5294f1-4d26-41e7-8911-220b9a6609f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Black Northside children have died</a> and one remains critically hospitalized after surviving a head wound. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Both Pugh and Bates told me they see their community trapped between these two dangers. “This is two sides of the same coin,” Bates said, explaining why she was advocating for Question 2. “What folks are feeling in terms of the uptick in violence and also not feeling protected by police officers … watching the response time from police get slower and slower and slower. There has to be an off ramp to that.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Pugh, in explaining why she opposed the question, echoed the same ideas: “The system that was made wasn’t designed for us, for Black people. Make sure you put that. Because the system wasn’t made for us, and it continues to oppress us.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a whole, the polling shows Minneapolis voters have seemingly paradoxical feelings about their police force. It found that voters have an unfavorable opinion of the MPD, 53 percent to 33 percent — but oppose reducing its size, 55 percent to 29 percent. The message is as clear as it is conflicting: Police are not doing a good job, and people are worried about what happens if there are fewer of them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That dynamic is especially pronounced among Black voters. They view the department unfavorably by a 58 percent to 28 percent margin, yet they oppose reducing its size by a whopping 75 percent to 14 percent. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/election-day-2021-virginia-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80913077</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a messy pile of conflicting feelings that can’t really be clarified by science. There’s never been a similar measure anywhere to study in order to understand the likely outcomes of Question 2, said Aaron Chalfin, a professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. And while <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/chalfin_mccrary2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research shows that the presence of police</a> and spending on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police decreases crime</a>, the question doesn’t actually call for<em> fewer</em> police. Likewise, the research also suggests the availability of good, legal jobs reduces crime and doesn’t show a connection between the severity of punishment and crime reduction. It’s not clear how non-police public safety officers — their presence and spending on them — would fit into these documented trends. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When we spoke to Bates and Pugh, they both talked about their own hope and cynicism, but they put those feelings in different places. Pugh had hope that the police department could be reformed into something that did serve the Black community, and she had a hard time believing the City Council could create a completely new and effective safety program. Bates, on the other hand, had a lot of hopes for the Department of Public Safety and reserved her cynicism for the possibility of change within the MPD culture. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Which leaves another big question besides just “will the question pass?” After this much division, can people who agree on nearly everything come back and work together again? “We all want the same thing,” Bates said. “We all want people in Minneapolis to be safe. We all want people in Minneapolis to be able to have the resources they need. And in the event that a crisis happens, that they can pick up the phone and trust that the right response will show up.”</p>]]></description>

<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Former President Donald Trump ended his presidency <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more unpopular than any of the last 12 presidents</a> at the end of their first terms and he is still unpopular post-presidency according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight’s new average of Trump’s favorability numbers</a>. Currently, 41.4 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the former president, while 53 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1539" height="664" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.00-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Overall, Trump’s unfavorability — now that he’s out of office we’re tracking his favorability numbers rather than his approval rating, both of which capture popularity — has remained steady just as his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low approval numbers mostly did</a> during his presidency. His popularity took a dip following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which meant that his overall favorability was quite low when we began tracking those numbers in February. But as you can see in the chart above, Trump’s favorability numbers have more or less returned to where his approval rating was before the insurrection.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Trump is still more unpopular than popular with the American public as a whole. Yet, despite Trump’s overall unfavorability, as my colleague Nathaniel Rakich wrote about last week, the majority of Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">want Trump to run for president again</a>, with polls suggesting that Republicans overall thought Trump <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/06/two-thirds-of-republicans-want-trump-to-retain-major-political-role-44-want-him-to-run-again-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a positive impact on politics</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We’ve never tracked former presidents’ favorability before, but Trump’s continued influence on the Republican Party is unusual. As such, we’ll be monitoring his popularity in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms and beyond. If he remains a key player in the party and Republican voters remain enthusiastic about his candidacy, that all could prove beneficial to a potential 2024 presidential bid.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On that note, we’re also launching <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new average of Vice President Kamala Harris’s job approval numbers</a>. That’s because Joe Biden, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-inauguration-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-ronald-reagan-pennsylvania-48d1659d4469999be87fbd87d560a52c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s oldest sitting president</a>, isn’t necessarily going to run for reelection in 2024. He even called himself a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-pick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“transition candidate”</a> on the 2020 campaign trail, which is why it’s important we track what Americans think of his No. 2, as it’s possible Harris runs for president in 2024. Harris’s approval rating currently sits at 42.7<strong> </strong>percent while her disapproval rating is at 52.5<strong> </strong>percent. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1527" height="675" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png" alt="" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-2.55.13-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Notably, though, Harris’s standing is not as good as Biden’s. Both her approval and disapproval ratings are worse than his. The president’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval rating</a> currently sits at 43.7 percent and his disapproval rating at 51 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Harris’s numbers aren’t <em>all</em> that different from Biden’s — her overall job approval seems to be largely tied at this point to his — but <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/kamala-harris-approval-rating-polls-vs-biden-other-vps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Los Angeles Times’s Harris favorability tracker has found that</a> the VP’s net favorability (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) is lower than former Vice Presidents Mike Pence, Biden, Dick Cheney and Al Gore. They also note in their analysis that Harris’s favorability began to decline in June after she was tasked with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/vice-president-kamala-harris-unveils-strategy-to-address-illegal-immigration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tackling immigration</a>, a thorny issue for Democrats.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible, as Peter Nicholas <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/kamala-harris-interview/619657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in The Atlantic in August</a>, that racism and sexism could be to blame for Harris’s low numbers. At FiveThirtyEight, we’ve written how <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-say-they-would-vote-for-a-woman-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women politicians, and especially women of color like Harris</a>, are often held to a different standard than men. And as Nicholas noted in his article, Harris has a high unfavorability margin among men (now 17 percentage points according to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/kamala-harris-approval-rating-polls-vs-biden-other-vps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Los Angeles Times</a>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, though, it’s still very early at this point, and a lot will likely change between now and the 2024 presidential election. But in the meantime, we’ll be tracking Trump’s favorability numbers and Harris’s approval ratings to get a better sense of how Americans think of them — especially if either, or both, are on the ballot in 2024.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Election Day is next Tuesday and one of the closest races to watch is the Virginia governor’s race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin. While McAuliffe has remained consistently in the lead, the race is now narrowing. <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/virginia-2021-poll-points-to-photo-finish-in-governor-s-race">A recent Emerson College/Nexstar Media poll</a> shows a tied race with 49 percent of likely voters supporting McAuliffe and 49 percent of likely voters supporting Youngkin. FiveThirtyEight’s polling average of the Virginia race now has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/">McAuliffe at 47.6 percent and Youngkin at 46.1 percent</a>.</li><li>New Jersey will also host a gubernatorial race on Tuesday. There, New Jerseyans will decide on whether to keep Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in office or replace him with Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. Some <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/new-jersey/">recent polls have suggested a close race</a>, but a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_NJ_102721/">Monmouth University poll</a> released on Wednesday found Murphy with an 11-point lead over Ciattarelli, 50 percent to 39 percent among registered voters. This marks a double-digit lead for Murphy, but his lead is down 2 points since Monmouth last asked voters in September.</li><li>More Americans now say they want an increase in police spending, per <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/">a recent Pew Research Center poll</a>. The poll found that 21 percent of Americans want to see police spending “increased a lot,” which is up 10 points from 2020. Even the share who want to see spending “increased a little” has risen 6 points from last year to 26 percent. To be sure, a plurality of Americans, 37 percent, want police spending to stay the same, but this has decreased 5 points since 2020.</li><li>A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has approved <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/things-covid-19-vaccination-kids-age-12/story?id=80126470">Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for children</a> ages 5 to 11, making it likely that kids could receive the shot as soon as November. Yet among Americans, support for vaccinating children against COVID-19 is split along familiar party lines. A majority of Democrats, 81 percent, support COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, while 54 percent of Republicans oppose it, according to a recent <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/10/27/voters-want-young-children-to-be-vaccinated-against-the-coronavirus">Data for Progress poll</a>.</li><li>Some parents are also concerned about the potential side effects of the vaccine, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/parents-vaccinating-children-age-5-11">recent Ipsos/Marketing for Change poll</a>. The poll found that 48 percent of parents with kids in the 5 to 11 age range were weighing vaccine side effects while 40 percent said protecting their child from getting sick with COVID-19 was a factor. Another 36 percent said their children’s ability to participate in school activities that require vaccination is a factor when weighing the decision to vaccinate their children. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a>, 43.7 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 51 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -7.3 points). At this time <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-majority-of-republican-voters-actively-want-trump-to-run-for-president-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, 43.7 percent approved and 50.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -6.4 points).

Climate Change Conference in Glasgow this weekend to demonstrate where the country stands on addressing climate change. If they wanted to make a blanket statement at the summit about how Americans view climate change, they could say most of us <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/dramatic-increase-in-public-beliefs-and-worries-about-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think it’s happening</a> (76 percent, according to a September survey from Yale Program on Climate Change Communication) and<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355427/americans-concerned-global-warming.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> most of us <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355427/americans-concerned-global-warming.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry about it at least a fair amount</a> (65 percent, according to a March survey from Gallup). Everything else about climate change, much like <em>everything else</em>, depends on your political affiliation, age, race and education. Zoom in again, however, and where you call home may just be the deciding factor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As my colleagues Alex Samuels and Mackenzie Wilkes <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-want-the-government-to-act-on-climate-change-whats-the-hold-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote earlier this month</a>, Democrats and Republicans are deep in a squabble over a budget bill containing a number of climate provisions — <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_100421/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actions that Americans broadly want</a>. But Americans are a lot more divided on how important it is to fight global warming: In a January 2020 survey from the Pew Research Center, 78 percent of Democrats said <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/16/u-s-concern-about-climate-change-is-rising-but-mainly-among-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dealing with climate change should be a top priority</a> for the executive and legislative branches, while only 21 percent of Republicans said the same. Instead of favoring government regulations to solve climate change, a majority of Republicans are hoping private businesses and technology will help combat climate change — now and into the future.</p>

That goes for younger Republicans, too, who are more likely than older Republicans to support government regulations <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/06/PS_2020.06.23_government-and-climate_00-015.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to shift the country toward renewable energy sources</a>, according to a 2020 survey from Pew. Those with at least some college education are also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/06/PS_2020.06.23_government-and-climate_00-09.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to believe our activity contributes to climate change</a>. And women — Republican and Democrat — are more concerned about and are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2019/11/PS_11.25.19_climate.energy-00-03.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to change their lifestyle</a> to protect the environment than men.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we’re divided in all the ways we normally are, yet there is some space for unity in thinking we ought to do something about our warming earth. Let’s take a look at what role geography plays in how Americans experience climate change and how they want their government to act. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a study</a> from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication,<a data-footnote-id="21" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data from the survey was taken from a dataset of representative climate surveys with a sample size over 25,000 U.S. adults.

&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>21</sup></a> exactly <em>who</em> wants the government to act depends on <em>where</em> you ask.</p>

</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As the map above shows, Americans in Coastal, Southern Border and Mountain West communities are the most likely to argue that climate change needs to be a high priority for the government. What these communities have in common is that they’re the most likely to feel the effects of a warming world.</p>



<h2><strong>Where Climate Change Hits The Hardest</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults said climate change <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2019/11/PS_11.25.19_climate.energy-00-013.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was affecting their local communities</a> at least “some,” according to an October 2019 Pew survey. At a more granular level, Americans from different regions say that climate change is affecting their neighborhoods in disparate ways. For example, Americans living in the Pacific West<a data-footnote-id="22" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>22</sup></a> and Mountain West<a data-footnote-id="23" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Utah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> were more likely than Americans in the Northeast and Midwest to say wildfires and threatened water sources are some of the major ways climate change is affecting their lives. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pew survey from 2020</a> found that 70 percent of Americans who lived within 25 miles of a coastline <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said climate change was directly affecting them</a> at least “some” — that included 45 percent of Republicans, a higher share compared to Republicans living further from the coast.</p>

Americans from those regions also stand out in their support of climate change legislation, such as fossil fuel regulations and carbon taxes. </p>



<h2><strong>Where Americans Support Climate Action</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the key elements initially in the budget bill would have rewarded utility companies that increase their share of energy from renewable energy sources, known as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/biden-climate-ambitions-die-in-the-senate/ba212f50-5e4f-407b-b3ec-99229c52981d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Energy Performance Program</a> (CEPP). While the CEPP is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/10/28/biden-spending-plan-what-is-in-it/#3CJGSH646VHETHIC4KK66XI3XE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all but assured to be dropped from the bill</a> due to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/key-senator-presented-an-alternative-power-plant-program-will-it-stick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of support from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin</a>, 66 percent of Americans <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/9/30/voters-support-the-clean-electricity-performance-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported it</a> when provided with a brief description of the program, according to a September survey from Data for Progress. Along the same lines of the CEPP, the Yale study asked Americans whether they would support requiring utilities to produce electricity from renewable energy sources, even if it would cost them an extra $100 per year. The share of residents in metropolitan areas who said they would support such a policy ranged from 7-to-13 percentage points higher than the national average. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><iframe title="Large cities lead the push for renewable energy" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0sh5G/10/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="759" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Moving away from the big U.S. cities, the Texas counties along the U.S.-Mexico border lean Democratic, though they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw some of the biggest swings to the right in 2020</a>, and demonstrate above-average support for climate change policies. Though most of these counties are considered rural, they display levels of support for climate legislation on par with those of major metropolitan areas. Looking at the map below in the border counties in the southernmost part of Texas, the share who said global warming will harm them personally ranges from 4-to-17 percent higher than the national average. </p>

<div><iframe title="Border counties worry about climate change" aria-label="map" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ufndm/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="653" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">And when it comes to supporting strategies addressing climate change like taxing fossil fuel companies or setting strict carbon emission limits, we see a similar pattern for Texans living in the southernmost counties.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1162" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wiederkehr-americans-on-climate-02-onemore.png" alt="Two maps of Texas counties showing the estimate share of adults who support taxing fossil fuel companies and setting strict CO2 limits on coal-fired power plants.

<p data-paragraph="main">America is physically and ideologically diverse, and that's reflected in how different parts of the country experience a warming planet. And when it comes to Americans’ feelings about addressing climate change or whose responsibility it should be, where they live just might trump their political affiliations. But Biden needs the<em> </em>Americans in<em> Congress</em> to bridge the divide to meet his goal <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to cut greenhouse gases in half by 2030</a> — movement on which would be nice to present in Scotland. That future isn’t so far off, but it remains to be seen how much longer we’ll be kicking the can down the road. </p>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">In early January 2021, then-President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to persuade</a> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state’s election results. Raffensperger rejected Trump’s requests as well as his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Now, Raffensperger is facing a primary in 2022 from Rep. Jody Hice, whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/politics/jody-hice-raffensperger-trump-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has endorsed</a> for Georgia secretary of state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-adam-schiff-is-worried-about-american-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue our conversation</a> about challenges to democracy in America by talking with Raffensperger, whose new book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Integrity-Counts/Brad-Raffensperger/9781637630334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrity Counts</a>,” comes out in November. He describes his experience being targeted by Trump and his supporters. Raffensperger also criticizes fellow Republicans in Georgia for not speaking out against Trump’s false claims of election fraud and for removing him as the chair of the Georgia Board of Elections this year. And he explains why he largely supports the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/big-changes-under-georgias-new-election-law-2021-06-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new voting laws</a> that Georgia Republicans passed since the 2020 election. We ask him what it all means for democracy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can read select, lightly edited excerpts below.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Galen Druke, host of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast:</strong> Were you or your family afraid [because of the threats directed at you after the 2020 election]?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Brad Raffensperger:</strong> I think that we’re getting concerned. Obviously, we left our house for a few days because they were talking about having a big rally up front. And that was just ginned up by people in positions of power, including the president.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Have things abated on your end? Are people no longer threatening elections officials or administrators?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> We’re not seeing that. In the book, the last text — the sexualized texts that Tricia has gotten was probably around Easter day. In the name of Jesus — yes, in the name of Jesus — someone sent her threatening “every day that we pray for your death” … </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> And that’s your wife? So that continued after January 6?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Oh, yeah, that continued well after January 6.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> I know that you supported overall the election changes in Georgia this year. But those laws included making you no longer chair of the state election board, which is responsible for overseeing elections in Georgia. That chair is now selected by the state legislature. Does that make Georgia’s elections more susceptible to meddling from the legislature?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Well, what it really does is it diminishes accountability of the state election board right now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Well, accountability for potentially doing screwy things? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Exactly. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Why even do this?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Well, and that’s one aspect that I did not support. Because when the secretary of state chairs the state election board, I am held accountable by the voters. And so I understand that I report to the voters. Now the chair of the state election board actually <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-voting-law-9-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports to the General Assembly</a>. So if you don’t like the decision that’s being made, who do you call? How do you have accountability? It’s so diffuse that everyone can start pointing fingers and it becomes like Washington, D.C. “Oh, I didn’t do that. It was this person, it was that person…” How do you hold anyone accountable? But when the state election board is chaired by the secretary of state, like it has been since the beginning of time here in Georgia, then all of a sudden, you know that you have accountability.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Did you view that as personal retribution?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Oh, yeah, [inaudible]. You know it was. It was really a blame-shifting. People didn’t know who and what had happened, and no one wanted to take responsibility and really speak truth to everyone and say here are the facts: President Trump did not get any votes from 28,000 voters. They skip. 28,000 people skip the presidential ballot.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Why won’t Republicans in Georgia speak that truth?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Moral courage. Lack of moral courage. And General Patton said that is probably one of the most lacking aspects of humankind.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> I mean, that’s a pretty big indictment of the Republican lawmakers in your party, that they lack moral courage. Does that make you question whether it’s the party for you?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Oh, no, it doesn’t. It’s both parties. And we have to be honest about that. People don’t stand up on the left side to a lot of the diatribes that they hear from their hard left, and people don’t want to stand up to the hard right. I’m a capital-C conservative. But sometimes you have to say to people, I think with kindness and gentleness, but you need to speak the truth.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> In some sense, it sounds like there are tradeoffs in terms of the way that election and voter laws get written. In Georgia, for example, Republicans had originally proposed doing away with mail voting for no-excuse absentee voting. They also were thinking of banning voting on Sundays, which is, of course — a lot of the Souls to the Polls programs function on Sundays because that’s when people go to church. And that specifically applies to Black Georgians in particular. Do you understand why Democrats had such a negative response to this bill out of the gate when provisions like that were included?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> And as it went through the process and calmer heads prevailed, thoughtful people spoke into that, what you saw, and they also had a multitude of committee hearings, so that everyone could be heard, including Democrats, and all that stuff that you just mentioned was stripped from the bill and what came out —</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> But where are they even going with that?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> Well, I think in some cases, they were really filing bills just to placate angry people. But at the end of the day, it never saw the time of day because people realized that we’re not going to go ahead and actually do some of the measures that were proposed.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Do you think that would have disenfranchised people? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR: </strong>Well, we ended up with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-voting-law-9-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more additional days of early voting</a>. We kept Sunday voting available for any county that wants to keep Sunday voting. So now, all 159 counties have to have 17 days of early voting, and any county can have Sunday voting that would like to have that. So that’s actually made it more accessible. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> What was going on there? Are there people in the Republican Party in the state legislature who did set out to try to make it harder for Democrats to vote at the start?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> There were a lot of thoughtful, solid, serious legislators that their voices were brought to bear. And what came through at the end of the day was a solid piece of legislation. And a lot of that other stuff, that chaff, was separated from the solid wheat that was proposed.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>GD:</strong> Is that stuff that you would speak out against if it were ever proposed again?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>BR:</strong> It died on the floor. I don’t think we’ll be seeing it again.<br></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Democratic leaders, activists and strategists spend a lot of time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing — and arguing about — policy</a> under the assumption that the policies the party prioritizes affect whether they will win the next election. It’s been a big part of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/bidens-plan-for-getting-big-things-done.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s governing strategy so far</a>, and one need look no further than Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-2020-autopsy-midterms/2021/05/18/6114af82-b80d-11eb-a5fe-bb49dc89a248_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blaming talk of defunding the police for losses in the House in 2020</a> or, conversely, citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/health-care-democrats-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health care in the 2018 midterm elections</a> as the reason they did so well to understand the role they think policy plays in their electoral success.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the research on whether choosing the right policy actually helps parties win elections is far less clear. How Democrats talk in 2021 and 2022 and what they prioritize <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/curse-presidents-second-year-biden/620391/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may — or may not — help them win the 2022 midterm elections</a>, but it will shape the policy and political landscape for the future in potentially profound ways. And that, perhaps, is what Democrats should be more worried about.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In political science, there’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716219860108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large body</a> of research that <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2950710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examines</a> how <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716219871222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy shapes politics</a>. The broad takeaway is that <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psj.12328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy matters</a> — <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/when-and-how-new-policy-creates-new-politics-examining-the-feedback-effects-of-the-affordable-care-act-on-public-opinion/D6AB7C1731CC530B5674473642C21E45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot</a> — but not in the ways that political pundits often think it does. Rather than helping parties win the <em>next </em>election, research suggests that major policies remake the political landscape in ways that reverberate far into the future — including changing expectations of government and creating new voter constituencies. This, in turn, can shape future elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Although controversial when they were first enacted, social programs like <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Security</a> and <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315133997/politics-medicare-theodore-marmor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicare</a> are classic examples of this phenomenon; they’ve become so popular and entrenched in our politics that parties perpetually <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/few-americans-support-cuts-to-most-government-programs-including-medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign to protect</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/18/5-facts-about-social-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strengthen them</a>. These programs have also essentially created a new political coalition of <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1022900327448.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired beneficiaries that actively mobilizes against any threats</a> to them. The survival of those programs is further aided by the fact that retired seniors are largely viewed as a group “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2939044.pdf?casa_token=zXplqaeFvBcAAAAA:j2qsqQFMghbLCYpje-TlkF-MCJYAl1_cV0oiwr81X_kevdZ4rO5xDqPRI3D7pRmrIhyijnVYgJOHXjCJXDzUTUBovrNBoo9kOsV6Y2dHP3ZXbE0kRS0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deserving</a>” of social welfare benefits. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Truly transformative policy has been rarer in recent decades, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-longer-can-this-era-of-political-gridlock-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan gridlock has stymied ambitious legislation</a>. But with Democrats advancing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-business-environment-medicare-cf3703ba7070447dfae7eca304a0b29d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investments in social spending</a> at levels not seen since former <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/02/how-bidens-economic-plan-compares-to-the-great-society-and-new-deal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society in the 1960s</a>, the potential long-term consequences of major policy changes are once again a key consideration. Those ramifications will almost certainly be more significant than any short-term electoral impacts.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On this, the Affordable Care Act is instructive. As the most consequential expansion of the social safety net in the 21st century (thus far), it did reshape our politics, but its complicated design and highly partisan implementation mostly just <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-democrats-have-an-ambitious-agenda-heres-what-they-should-learn-from-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinforced existing political divides</a>, making it harder for new voter constituencies to emerge. Moreover, the government’s role in providing health care benefits was obscured through its patchwork of insurance exchanges. As political scientist Suzanne Mettler has documented in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/opinion/our-hidden-government-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Submerged State</a>,” this is a major design flaw of many government programs: Indirect benefits are very commonplace, which can make it hard for voters to understand the role government plays in the benefits they receive. Policies that feel invisible don’t transform politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Additionally, because the Affordable Care Act, with its health exchanges and subsidies and limited sign-up windows, is <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article-abstract/43/4/651/134453/After-Defeat-Conservative-Postenactment-Opposition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very complicated</a>, Democrats had a hard time explaining its benefits, while Republicans had an easy time attacking it. This reflects a broader point political scientist Jamila Michener has argued in “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fragmented-democracy/9A69DF1567190EF38883D4766EBC0AAC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragmented Democracy</a>”: Many government benefits are made intentionally difficult to obtain, in a process that’s both bureaucratic and demeaning to those seeking the benefits. That’s especially true for means-tested programs aimed at helping lower-income voters and communities of color, run by Republican-controlled state governments. The consequences, Michener writes, are that recipients think less of the government and become less engaged in politics. Thus, rather than creating new constituencies and clear benefits, many government programs disappear into the ether of anonymity or bolster alienation from the government.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In an earlier, more bipartisan era, such policy design choices were arguably the price of political compromise, with Democrats generally more supportive of social spending and Republicans more inclined to change the tax code rather than provide direct subsidies that would require new government agencies. The ACA is illustrative of that. In 2009, when Democrats wrote the bill, they had every intention of getting Republican support and designed a policy around market exchanges to win bipartisan blessing. Twelve years later, leaders in Congress <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bipartisanship-in-the-senate-is-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are far less likely</a> to pursue bipartisanship. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats’ ambitions for social spending — though scaled back over the last several weeks — are still far larger than they have been since the 1960s, largely because they are now liberated from trying to find Republican support. And what’s key here is that many of these programs could create constituencies with beneficiaries, who will become mobilized to sustain the program. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, if implemented, government-funded child care is a benefit that many working parents will come to depend on. It is unlikely to break through in time for the 2022 midterm elections, but over time, it is a benefit that Democrats may be able to campaign on protecting. This would also have been true of free college tuition for community college, another program Democrats contemplated but did <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-abandon-free-community-college-white-house-warns-social-safety-n1281939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not include in the latest round of negotiations</a>. Policies like these — if designed to be clear, easy to access and visibly associated with government — stand a real chance of assembling durable, supportive coalitions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, the shorter-term risk is that any new government program yields an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716219862511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immediate backlash</a>. It’s far easier for opponents to play up the costs and demonize the program when no voters have come to rely on the benefits. Moreover, since many social spending programs are likely to benefit communities of color, Republican opposition is likely to play on racial tropes, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00577.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as it did with the ACA</a> and other social programs before that.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/guess-americans-democrats-spending-bill-80782414</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">The potential electoral risk is why some Democrats and Democratic strategists want the party to <a href="https://www.vox.com/22338417/james-carville-democratic-party-biden-100-days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus more on bread-and-butter issues, like economic policy.</a> The concern is that if Democrats make race and racial justice too much of their agenda, they risk <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4330.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alienating voters</a>, especially white voters without a college degree, who are geographically important. But what this misses is that Republican messaging is going to focus on <a href="https://gen.medium.com/shor-is-mainly-wrong-about-racism-which-is-to-say-about-electoral-politics-77692910255c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious conflicts over race and identity</a> regardless of what Democrats do. So if the Biden administration and Democratic Party leaders think they can duck having these conversations, they are mistaken, especially <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/01/24/u-s-media-polarization-and-the-2020-election-a-nation-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given that a few outlets exercise a stranglehold over the media ecosystem on the political right</a>. Moreover, spending on expanded social programs might actually help Democrats win over some of these voters in the long run, especially since they tend to be lower-income and are also <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/on-the-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to be women</a>, who would benefit most directly from free child care.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even adopting such programs doesn’t mean Democrats will win the messaging wars of 2022 — or even 2024. Midterm elections generally go against the party in power. And arguably, for at least the next two election cycles, the basic rules of who can vote and how votes are counted will be far, far more consequential. Social spending policy, by contrast, is unlikely to have a huge effect on 2022 — even if Democrats do pass popular programs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some backlash is inevitable; even policies that eventually poll well take time to become popular because voters must experience them and actually value them. Partisanship is also sticky and slow to change. Most voters evaluate policy and programs through partisan media and judge programs by whether the programs are <em>Democratic </em>programs or <em>Republican </em>programs. But on the margins — and especially over time — policies shape both identities and party coalitions. Citizens recognize the policies they support or oppose as part of who they are, and the policies and issues that different parties “own” in the present can shape the terrain of future elections. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Abortion is one of the thorniest political issues in America, and it’s been that way for years. But it’s also an area where Americans’ views are complex and often contradictory. What people really think about abortion access is notoriously difficult to capture in a poll. And how people feel about the issue is influenced by all kinds of hard-to-quantify factors — their own personal experiences, the political landscape and more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So we want to capture some of that complexity by talking to you. Think you have a perspective on abortion that’s not represented in the news? Believe we should be talking or thinking about abortion differently? Not sure when you think abortion should be legal or under what circumstances? Fill out the form below to tell us a little about your perspective on abortion, and we might follow up to hear more.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The United States is in the middle of a once-in-a-decade process: redistricting. And although it’s early yet — 19 states aren’t expected to finalize their maps until next year — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of states have proposed maps</a>, and there are debates happening all across the country over which ones to pass. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six states have finalized maps</a>.<a data-footnote-id="15" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. on Oct. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Americans aren’t necessarily confident that the process will be a fair one. Just 16 percent of U.S. adults said they thought their states’ congressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44 percent said they thought the maps would be drawn unfairly, per an August <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/83q2toal17/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/Economist poll</a>. Another 40 percent of adults said they were unsure if the maps will be fair. That might be one reason why independent commissions, which aim to empower ordinary citizens to draw map lines, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mo-state-wire-ut-state-wire-supreme-courts-wa-state-wire-ia-state-wire-4d2e2aea7e224549af61699e51c955dd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have grown in use</a> since the last redistricting cycle. In that same YouGov/Economist poll, 50 percent of Americans said they thought independent commissions should be responsible for the redistricting process in their state.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s unclear whether independent commissions will be enough to help build trust in the redistricting process. For some, the redistricting process is simply “the most political activity in American politics,” according to Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College and author of “Redistricting and Gerrymandering in North Carolina: Battlelines in the Tar Heel State.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And Bitzer doesn’t see that changing anytime soon.</p>



<h2><strong>The problem</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many Americans think maps that intentionally favor one party is a serious issue in U.S. elections. According to an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/public-supportive-of-many-voting-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC</a> poll conducted in March, 67 percent of Americans thought that states drawing such maps was a “major problem.” In fact, respondents to that survey thought gerrymandering was a bigger problem than disenfranchisement or voter fraud. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Redistricting has been a problem in a number of states, to the extent that the court has had to intervene. According to the nonpartisan redistricting website <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Court%20Action&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All About Redistricting</a>, the courts rejected all or part of the maps in five states and drew new maps in 12 other states. And there is already <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Plan%20Status&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one lawsuit pending this year</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In states like North Carolina, where gerrymandering has particularly been an issue, trust in the redistricting process is extremely low. In the past decade, the state has had to draw its congressional districts three different times. After the initial drawing in 2011, the courts found in a 2016 ruling that the state’s map had been racially gerrymandered to disadvantage Black voters in the state, a decision that was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upheld by the Supreme Court</a>. Following the lower court’s decision, Public Policy Polling found in a 2017 survey that <a href="https://democracync.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NorthCarolinaRedistrictingPollResults2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86 percent of North Carolina voters</a> were either “somewhat” or “very” concerned about the effect of partisan politics on the state’s maps. Then, in 2019, a state court panel threw out North Carolina’s 2016 map because it was ruled <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/court-throws-out-north-carolina-s-congressional-district-maps-n1073081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partisan gerrymander</a> that gave Republicans an upper hand.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bitzer stressed that perceptions of fairness in states like North Carolina have a lot to do with the political nature of the process. “Then you also add in the hyper-partisanship, the intense polarization and the lack of trust from one side of the political aisle to the other — I think all of those factors come together and probably make us even more intensely cynical, more intensely questioning the process of redistricting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even North Carolina’s third map, drawn ahead of the 2020 election, wasn’t entirely fair — we found in our analysis, for instance, that the median district in the state was still <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/north-carolinas-new-house-map-hands-democrats-two-seats-but-it-still-leans-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 points more Republican-leaning than the state as a whole</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Why ensuring a fair map is so hard</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s difficult, though, for states, like North Carolina to rectify unfair maps. That’s because in 2019, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court ruled</a> that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/731847977/supreme-court-rules-partisan-gerrymandering-is-beyond-the-reach-of-federal-court?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partisan gerrymandering is a political question</a> that the federal courts can’t resolve. This has meant that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-gerrymandering-isnt-the-supreme-courts-problem-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states</a> get to determine whether a map is fair or unfair — and that process can vary a lot depending on the state. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/02/wisconsin-gerrymandering-case-dismissed-after-high-court-ruling/1634244001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a panel of federal judges</a> threw out a partisan gerrymandering case in Wisconsin involving the state’s 2011 map following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision, leaving that map in place. Wisconsin is now, of course, redrawing its map, but given that the government is divided — the governor is a Democrat, but Republicans control the state legislature — and there are already <a href="https://www.wpr.org/democrats-file-first-wisconsin-2021-redistricting-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two lawsuits</a> over <a href="https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-legislature-asks-us-supreme-court-intervene-federal-redistricting-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the redistricting process</a>, it’s possible that the courts will need to draw the lines if Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on a map.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s why in some states, voters are trying to address redistricting themselves in the form of independent redistricting commissions.</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/adam-schiff-worried-american-democracy-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-80716056</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Independent commissions are designed to keep partisan politics out of the redistricting process by putting the power to draw lines in the hands of ordinary citizens — although in some states, these commissions comprise a bipartisan group of lawmakers. And research has found that independent commissions can improve voters’ trust in the redistricting process. For instance, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bSI442jvLJrndLT6waMZ_48QyrAobqxn/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers at the University of Southern California</a> found that when California voters were told the state uses independent commissions (which it does) and the process was explained to them, 73 percent of respondents thought the process was fair. But when they were told the state legislature draws the lines (which it doesn’t) just 32 percent thought the process was fair.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“[T]he ability to explain to voters how [commissions] actually work might improve their perceptions of trust, and it definitely improves their perceptions of fairness,” said Christian Grose, a political science professor at USC and co-author of the paper.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2010, just <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four states</a> had an independent commission of citizens, but that total is now <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&amp;level=Congress&amp;cycle=2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight</a> in the 2020 redistricting cycle.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Yet it’s possible that independent commissions aren’t a panacea for the lack of faith in the redistricting process. In March, just 41 percent of Michigan voters said they <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/micrc/MICRC_Market_Research_722339_7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a positive view of the state’s commission</a>, according to a survey conducted the Glengariff Group. And the Colorado <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/colorado/final_plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commission’s map</a> will likely displease Democrats, as it opens the possibility of a 4-4 Democratic-Republican seat split in a state that has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trended reliably blue in recent years</a> — even though the map is better than the old map in that it encourages more competitive elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a risk The Atlantic’s Russell Berman <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/democrats-redistricting-gerrymandering-majority-midterms/620403/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out earlier this month</a>. Democrats, in particular, have long advocated for more independent commissions, but better governance is often at odds with political gain. And of course, Republicans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-states-won-and-lost-seats-in-the-2020-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will draw 2.5 times as many maps as Democrats</a> in the 2020 redistricting cycle. Meanwhile, states with independent commissions or split partisan control will be responsible for drawing lines in just 38 percent of districts. But even if the playing field were more level, it’s not clear that voters would trust the redistricting process more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Bitzer told me, voters’ perceptions of a fair map often boils down to their own partisan leanings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They will know if something is fair or unfair by how many Republicans get elected, how many Democrats get elected and what their political party affiliations [are],” Bitzer said. </p>]]></description>

<p data-paragraph="main">With just over a week to go before state elections in Virginia and New Jersey, recent polling shows that the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/new-jersey-2021-gov-murphy-with-six-point-lead-over-republican-challenger-ciattarelli">races for governor are close</a> in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_VA_102021/">both states</a>. Each election will be a test for the national political environment, especially as Democrats in Congress try to finalize their multi-trillion-dollar economic and social-programs bill.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On this episode of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses the gubernatorial races and how Americans feel about the potential provisions in the Democrats’ big bill. They also talk about the major sticking points among Democrats as the bill is put together, the ways to poll Americans on these policies and which provisions are most likely to survive the cut.</p>
