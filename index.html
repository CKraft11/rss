	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">The 2022 midterm elections will determine whether President Biden still has congressional backing during the final two years of his first term. Only twice since the Great Depression has a newly elected president’s party <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/seats-congress-gainedlost-the-presidents-party-mid-term-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gained seats in the House</a> in the midterms. In this installment of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses which indicators are worth watching to get a sense for how the parties will perform in 2022. They also ask whether <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/351932/americans-life-ratings-reach-record-high.aspx">a recent Gallup poll</a> reporting that a record number of Americans say they are “thriving” is a “good or bad use of polling.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[
<p data-paragraph="main">Donald Trump is still the undisputed leader of the Republican Party. But you probably already knew that. The medley of conservative voters, politicians, activists and political commentators that descended on Dallas this past weekend for this year’s second <a href="https://cpac.conservative.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservative Political Action Conference</a> certainly did. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some things are less clear. Namely, ahead of the midterm elections, GOP voters seem to be casting about for the best path forward and debating whether their energy would be better utilized by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/10/ken-paxton-donald-trump-election-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relitigating the results of last year’s presidential race</a> (again) or chugging forward to what’s expected to be a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republican-trump-2022-midterms-election-falsehoods/2021/07/04/3a43438c-d36f-11eb-ae54-515e2f63d37d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grueling midterm cycle</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This schism amongst Republicans was on display throughout the weekend. Take, for example, a conversation I had with James Scott, a once-reluctant Trump supporter who’s now all in. After retrieving a hot coffee on the second day of CPAC, he sheepishly admitted to me that, back in 2016, he “held his nose” before voting for the now-former president. Standing across from me with a “<a href="https://thechosengifts.com/products/come-and-see-chosen-hat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Come and See</a>” baseball cap, the bespectacled retiree described his past self as a “Marco Rubio aficionado” who joined Team Trump only after Trump announced an ultra-conservative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/politics/donald-trump-supreme-court-nominees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court shortlist</a> ahead of the 2016 general election. And now, Scott is so devoted that he believes assessing Trump’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseless lies</a> about rampant election fraud is critical to the GOP’s future. “We must have election integrity,” he told me. The truth, he added, “must be brought out because the future depends on it.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Compare that, though, to 20-year-old Aaron Genus, a college student, Instagram personality and restaurant worker who came to the conference from Michigan. Genus made clear that he, too, believed the 2020 election was “an absolute joke;” but unlike Scott, he’s ready for the party to move on. “In America, there’s no such thing as an election do-over,” he said. “Once Trump got in that helicopter and waved goodbye, it was over. There’s no way to undo what happened. All we can do is fight for our election integrity come the next two cycles.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into CPAC, I was curious where voters’ heads were at. How preoccupied would attendees be with rehashing 2020 versus looking ahead to 2022? In years past, CPAC has been a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cpac-brief-history-conservative-movement-120815471.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful barometer</a> for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/25/donald-trump-cpac-republicans-allies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base of the Republican Party</a> and its most fervent activists — even if it <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/cpac-straw-poll-winners-dont-always-become-gop-nominees/448083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t always indicative</a> of the party’s future. This year was no exception, although the choice of whether to press on from the previous election is arguably a new one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A bevy of speakers decried claims of a stolen election (though they are false), and <a href="https://cpac.conservative.org/agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least two events</a> were devoted exclusively to how to spot and guard against election fraud. Other panels focused on how to expand the party’s base, and ahead of Trump’s culminating speech, an emcee declared that “2022 starts right here.” What I found, though, is that only a small handful of attendees were actually ready to move on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/democrats-republicans-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing the U.S. House in 2018</a> and the Senate and White House in 2020, Republicans are eager to identify candidates who can help them successfully reclaim Congress in 2022 and the presidency in 2024. But if this weekend’s CPAC conference is any indication of the party’s priorities, some of the staunchest Republicans are more concerned about challenging the last election than winning the next. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I still feel we were so cheated in 2020 and I don’t think that’s been resolved,” attendee Pat DeLange, who turned 63 on Saturday, told me. “So when there is cheating involved it needs to be exposed. I think we need to get the rightful president back in office so he can fix this and wake people up.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump, for his part, seemed more concerned with the past, too. If nothing else, it’s one way for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/07/trump-post-presidency-plans-434324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">him to maintain relevance</a> as the party’s de facto leader while he irons out his future plans. During a roughly 90-minute speech on Sunday, he mentioned — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/12/politics/analysis-trump-election-lies-blog-post-presidency/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar to prior interviews and appearances</a> — a “rigged election” and sarcastically quipped that he “lost” last year’s race. (The crowd went wild at these bits, repeatedly booing at claims of fraud.) But perhaps most notably, he continued to tease supporters on whether he’ll run again. (“I will never stop fighting for you,” he told a brimming crowd, which chanted back, “Four more years!”)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, considering Trump’s grip on the party — 53 percent of self-identified Republicans said in a May <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/53-republicans-view-trump-true-us-president-reutersipsos-2021-05-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> opinion poll that they believe he is the “true president”  — it’s not surprising that supporters are still overwhelmingly taking cues from the former president. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent polls on who won the 2020 election confirm</a> that much of the party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-republicans-distrust-this-years-election-results-than-democrats-after-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t over last year</a>, either. In November, roughly three in four Trump supporters said Biden’s win was due to voter fraud, per a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_111820.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University poll</a>. And those numbers have barely budged. According to that May Reuters/Ipsos <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-05/Ipsos%20Reuters%20Topline%20Write%20up-%20The%20Big%20Lie%20-%2017%20May%20thru%2019%20May%202021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>, 56 percent of Republicans still believe the election was rigged. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Experts I spoke to ahead of the convention said they’ve never seen a past president maintain his position as head of a political party as Trump has, but they weren’t shocked with the crowd’s obsession with the past either. “It’s not a real future-oriented crowd. I’d say they’re more interested in what they see as [a] fraudulent election and litigating all that,” said <a href="http://hs.umt.edu/polsci/people/default.php?s=Saldin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Saldin</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Montana. “But it’s always been a backwards looking thing. ‘Make America Great Again’ is casting a tide to the past, so I think, in a way, there’s always been a backwards focus there that’s been relatively rare in American politics.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, fealty to Trump (and, by virtue, his false claims of fraud) were a key theme of the weekend. Not only were attendees there wearing a sea of red, white and blue outfits and accessories bearing Trump’s face and name, they overwhelmingly selected Trump as their preferred candidate for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/562472-trump-desantis-lead-cpac-straw-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the CPAC straw poll</a>. He captured 70 percent of the ballots in the anonymous survey — a boost from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/02/28/trump-wins-cpac-straw-poll-with-florida-gov-ron-desantis-his-closest-contender/?sh=f67a23934ea9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 percent</a> he won in a similar poll at the Orlando CPAC conference in February. Also during the conference, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbraddock/status/1413904794335420417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attendees circulated</a> a seven-point plot to reinstate Trump as president in a matter of days. (There’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-trump-cant-be-reinstated-as-president-by-august-2021-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no constitutional mechanism</a> for reinstating a former president.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, those who want to leave 2020 behind were at the conference, too, but they were a minority. On the last day of CPAC, I found Grizzly Joe, a Trump supporter who received national attention <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/07/10/cpac-trump-supporters-dallas-osullivan-sot-nr-vpx.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for telling CNN</a> he believed Biden was the true winner of the November election. (While he had media credentials for the event, he told me he was half there for coverage and half there as an attendee.) “Looking in the rearview mirror isn’t going to help us move forward,” he told me. When I asked him whether there’s too much focus right now on debunked claims of fraud, he told me that, “some people are like a dog with a bone. If there’s fraud let’s find it, root it out and fix it. … But people jumping up and down bellyaching about Trump being the real president isn’t going to put Trump back in the White House.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A second conversation with Barbara Lewis, 65, who wore a Trump 2024 shirt and blue leggings with red and white stars, yielded much of the same sentiment. “They fought the [last] election enough, and the fight kind of just needs to end. I don’t think they can go any further with the fight.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too early to say where the Republican Party will go from here, but at least for now, it’s clear that Trump and the 2020 election are still very resonant in voters’ minds. And that makes perfect sense considering Trump himself has a foot in both the past and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-endorsements-republicans/2021/06/26/86228924-d465-11eb-ae54-515e2f63d37d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the future</a>. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
<p data-paragraph="main">In the 1960s and 70s, conservatives were waging a war against what they considered an existential threat infiltrating America’s public schools. Pamphlets were circulated by the John Birch Society, a right-wing extremist group, declaring it a “<a href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2613&amp;context=open_access_etds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filthy Communist plot</a>.” And then-Governor Ronald Reagan of California decried it as a “moral crisis” that needed to be eradicated. What was poisoning the minds of America’s youth? Sex education.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These days, sex ed is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more widely accepted</a>, especially <a href="https://time.com/3578597/aids-sex-ed-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the HIV/AIDS epidemic</a> (though conservatives have still managed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/conservatives-propose-revised-sex-ed-rules-lgbtq-pushback-77073959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to beat back more progressive school curricula</a> when it comes to sexual health), but the Republican Party’s habit of identifying a bogeyman in America’s education system hasn’t wavered. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then it was sex ed. Now, it’s critical race theory.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Critical race theory is <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a legal scholarship framework</a> that has been around in academia for four decades and asserts that racism is systemic and embedded in many American institutions. But over the past few months, the term has been co-opted by Republicans as a catch-all buzzword to signify <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/06/what-is-critical-race-theory-is-it-really-taught-in-schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the perceived threat</a> of anti-white indoctrination in American schools. This has motivated a slate of proposed legislation outlawing a wide range of teachings. Since the start of this year, at least six states have enacted bans on the teaching of critical race theory or discussions of racism in the classrooms, according to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/07/02/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brookings Institute</a> analysis, while almost 20 other states have introduced similar bills. Moreover, <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/republicans-in-5-states-seek-to-keep-1619-project-curriculum-out-of-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of states</a>, like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-race-and-ethnicity-government-and-politics-education-74d0af6c52c0009ec3fa3ee9955b0a8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/15/abbott-critical-race-theory-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a>, have also successfully banned the teaching of the <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/lesson-plan-grouping/1619-project-curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times’s 1619 Project</a> curriculum, which explores the central role of slavery in the development of the U.S. The project <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/why-conservatives-want-cancel-1619-project/618952/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been harshly criticized</a> by conservatives who have accused its writers of recasting history through a racial lens. To be sure, the bills vary. Some bills mention critical race theory directly, while others only reference bans on “<a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText21/HouseText21/H6070.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divisive concepts</a>” or any teachings that imply “<a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2021-22%20ENR/hB/HB1775%20ENR.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one race or sex is inherently superior</a>.” But this concerted effort to limit what can be taught in our schools isn’t new — it’s the latest chapter in the GOP’s long-standing push to target curricula that goes against its political ideology. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican attacks on cultural issues within America’s public schools follow a familiar pattern. First, they’re usually in response to a vague idea of what <em>might </em>happen — that is, teaching sexual health <a href="https://www.kqed.org/education/534518/sex-education-in-america-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>might</em> lead to more school-aged teenagers having sex</a> (although there’s actually <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/fewer-american-high-schoolers-having-sex-than-ever-before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been a decline</a> in the percentage of American high schoolers having sex since the early 1990s). Second, when there is a debate over teaching often taboo, complex social issues, like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-business-education-government-and-politics-905c354a805cec1785160cf21f04c7ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racism</a>, <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/essay/darwin-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolution</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/28/whats-the-best-way-to-teach-sex-ed-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sex</a>, elected school board members can exert an outsized amount of control. Considering school board members are <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/why-school-board-diversity-matters/2020/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to be white and are often partisan</a>, Republicans’ political agenda <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858418818074" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can get a disproportionate amount of weight</a> in school board decisions. And if the contemporary Republican Party has taught us anything as of late, it’s that “anti-wokeness” is political <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catnip for its base</a>, so it’s unlikely that this crusade goes away any time soon. In fact, because critical race theory deals so explicitly with racism and discrimination, it has arguably <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animated the GOP base</a> in a way that previous education battles haven’t. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One of the oldest education battles revolves around the teaching of evolution. It’s one that until recently didn’t have clearly drawn partisan lines. After all, the most famous example of a legislative attempt to prohibit teaching evolution in schools was actually introduced by a Democrat: a 1925 Tennessee state law to ban teaching evolution in schools. That <a href="https://www.npr.org/2005/07/05/4723956/timeline-remembering-the-scopes-monkey-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law was later challenged in a showy court case</a> (complete with chimpanzees) that same year, where it was upheld, and ultimately not repealed until 1967. (It was also a Democrat who introduced a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/12/10/creationism-case-raises-issues-of-faith-freedom/ce2bf87f-513d-4ea3-95f8-dab73dfc93a8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1981 bill in Louisiana’s state legislature</a> that mandated the teaching of “creation science” — which presents religious beliefs as alternative scientific theories — whenever evolution was taught. The Supreme Court has since banned states from <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-06-20-mn-8487-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring creation science</a> to be taught, but it has remained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/24/bobby-jindal-republican-creationism-2016-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a popular conservative cultural flashpoint</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the last two decades, Republicans at the state level have introduced <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ssqu.12267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 bills</a> aimed at undermining evolution, through tactics such as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/316487-new-wave-of-anti-evolution-bills-hit-states?rl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowing teachers to “question” established scientific concepts</a>. Most of these bills never go anywhere — a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ssqu.12267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 study</a> found just six anti-evolution bills out of 110 introduced between 2000 and 2012 were enacted into law — but the fact that legislatures keep proposing them means one of the U.S. public education system’s oldest bogeyman is still alive and well.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, sex education in public schools has long been a target of Republicans, although once it became clear that sex education programs actually help <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/whatworks/what-works-sexual-health-education.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the risk of teen pregnancy and STIs and delay the age</a> when teens become sexually active, sex ed became more socially accepted. This means that Republicans opposed to sex ed have had to change their strategy to curtailing what’s taught. Sixteen states, for instance, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require educators to “stress” abstinence education</a> and do not require anything be taught about contraception, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advances sexual and reproductive health and rights.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every bill was introduced by Republican lawmakers, but the majority were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Another popular strategy is giving <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/education/florida-parents-can-opt-their-students-out-of-sex-education-with-newly-signed-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents the right</a> to opt their child out of sex ed, or making <a href="https://azednews.com/senate-hears-bill-that-would-require-parents-to-opt-in-not-opt-out-for-sex-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sex ed opt-in</a> to begin with. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And more recently, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/7/18088680/common-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beginning in the late 2000s</a>, a culture war clash emerged following the adoption of the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-debate-over-common-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a> — a set of K-12 academic standards that was aggressively pushed by the federal government. While the initiative was designed to promote a good education by giving students specific guidelines about what they should know, grade by grade, in subjects like math and English language arts, it <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/common-core-education-reform-backlash-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced fierce opposition from Republicans</a> and Democrats alike. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But around 2015, the Core standards became especially politicized by <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/08/gop-education-summit-six-candidates-meet-with-campbell-brown-in-new-hampshire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians on the right</a> who thought curriculum standards should be left to local officials. For instance, when Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/09/25/494740056/donald-trumps-plan-for-americas-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran for the White House in 2016</a>, his early ads argued that “education has to be at a local level.” And in 2018, Trump’s former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos falsely declared the Common Core was “<a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-us-education-secretary-betsy-devos-american-enterprise-institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dead</a>” — even though it’s up to individual states, and not the federal government, whether to ditch the Core standards.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, more than 40 states passed laws adopting the Common Core standards in their schools. But &lt;a href="https://www.achieve.org/files/StrongStandards_032919.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than 20 states&lt;/a&gt; have now revised, repealed or rolled back parts of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s clear culture war issues have always had a place in how Republicans think about education, but as Terry Moe, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank, told us, Republicans also used to advocate for more policy-focused solutions. He pointed to Republican-led initiatives like the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/27/443110755/no-child-left-behind-what-worked-what-didnt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Child Left Behind Act</a>, which, in part, sought to use standardized testing to help improve student achievement. These kinds of initiatives have since <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-child-has-failed/2015/02/13/8d619026-b2f8-11e4-827f-93f454140e2b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received their own criticism</a>, but they represent a very different strategy than the one that currently dominates the Republican Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The Republican Party has really gotten further and further away from being a party of ideas about how to solve social problems — one of them being an education system that does not perform very well — and becoming a party of anger and resentment. That’s what they specialize in now,” Moe said. “They are, for the most part, fighting a culture war against the Democrats and trying to pander to their base.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, critical race theory fits perfectly into the Republicans’ agenda, as it’s a cultural bugbear that conservatives have co-opted to encompass a range of trends they think are unpopular with Americans. (One of the lead architects pushing the anti-critical race theory backlash, Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210609235759/https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1371541044592996352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said as much</a>.) This is particularly true for topics centered specifically around race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They’re worried about what happens when a reckoning takes hold in their kids’ schools where their kids might learn some things about American history — or about themselves or people like them — that are uncomfortable truths,” said Hakeem Jefferson, a FiveThirtyEight contributor and professor of political science at Stanford University. “This is merely another example of white Americans using schools as sites of their racial political projects, which set out to maintain dominance and do so by way of not telling the full truth of American history.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many Americans still don’t know what the debate over critical race theory is really about at this point. Just 24 percent have heard “a lot” about it, 25 percent know “some” and 51 percent know little or nothing at all, according to a June <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017a-36ee-d33b-a37f-3eee757a0000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=2fabe135-eaca-4acf-a36a-a0e8fde3c741&amp;nlid=630318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> poll. But tellingly, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to have seen, heard or read a lot about critical race theory, 30 percent versus 21 percent. What’s more, those Republicans familiar with critical race theory overwhelmingly dislike it — 78 percent have a negative opinion of it compared to 7 percent of Democrats. When asked to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/23/critical-race-theory-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describe</a> critical race theory in that same survey, one Republican respondent called critical race theory “a farce,” while another said it was a “Marxist proposal.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Considering how much more exposure Republicans have had to it — a <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-has-mentioned-critical-race-theory-nearly-1300-times-past-35-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Media Matters analysis</a> shows Fox News has mentioned critical race theory 1,300 times in less than four months, and a query of data on the social media tool CrowdTangle <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinReuning/status/1401166962575749123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from researchers</a> at Miami University and Wright State University found that the share of posts that mention critical race theory on the Facebook pages of local Republican parties has risen exponentially — the blowback among members of the GOP is not entirely surprising. It’s also not just the volume of coverage: The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-joy-reid-conflates-opposing-critical-race-theory-supporting-qanon-radicalized-parent-activists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative media’s coverage</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-critical-race-theory-crazed-ideologues-attack-hurt-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of critical race theory is</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly negative</a>, too, as it’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2021/05/09/the-war-on-critical-race-theory-continues-as-some-call-it-anti-white/?sh=6c0fba1373a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decried by some on the right</a> as anti-white.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have long fought specters within education that they claim threaten the American way of life. The current blowback against critical race theory follows in that tradition, but it also represents a broader transformation of the GOP into a populist party focused on waging culture wars. Though it may seem like a misguided crusade-du-jour, the tumult around critical race theory is both a reflection of the Republican Party’s past — and a glimpse at its future. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been said that women are from Venus and men are from Mars. Broadly speaking, that’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Are_from_Mars,_Women_Are_from_Venus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a laughable bit of pop psychology</a>, but there’s a measure of truth to it when it comes to politics. That’s because women have voted notably more Democratic than men in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-won-the-right-to-vote-100-years-ago-they-didnt-start-voting-differently-from-men-until-1980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every presidential race since 1980</a> — and the 2020 contest between Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-men-stuck-with-trump-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was no different</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study of validated voters from the Pew Research Center</a> suggests, however, that the gender gap — or how women voted compared with men — meaningfully narrowed from 2016 to 2020. Pew found that 55 percent of women supported Biden compared with 48 percent of men, a gender gap of 7 percentage points.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculating the gender gap is tricky, as it &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-gender-gap-was-huge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has been measured&lt;/a&gt; several ways. Sometimes it is calculated in terms of vote share margin (or the distance between the relative advantage one candidate or party has among men and the relative advantage that candidate or party has among women). The &lt;a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender_gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Center for American Women and Politics&lt;/a&gt; at Rutgers University recommends measuring the gender gap by the difference in male and female support for a particular candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> This marked a 6-point reduction from the 13-point gap Pew found in 2016, when 39 percent of women and 52 percent of men backed Trump. And the gender gap seems to have shrunk for two main reasons. First, Biden significantly improved his standing among men — he won 48 percent of men versus Hillary Clinton’s 41 percent. Second, Trump significantly improved his standing among women — he won 44 percent of women in 2020 versus 39 percent in 2016.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s harder to pinpoint exactly <em>why</em> the gender gap shrunk from 2016 to 2020, but Pew’s numbers point to a couple of possible explanations, particularly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the influence that educational attainment has on vote choice</a>. Consider Biden’s improvement among college-educated men. He won 58 percent of this group, a giant leap from Clinton’s 49 percent in 2016. And his performance among college-educated men marked a 10-point advantage over how he did among men overall. Conversely for Trump, his gains among women were largely concentrated among those without a four-year college degree. His support among that group grew from 43 percent in 2016 to 50 percent in 2020. Taken together, this reflects the recent trend of Americans with higher education levels <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifting toward the Democrats</a>, and less-well-educated Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving toward the GOP</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This shift was especially notable among white voters,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we mean non-Hispanic white voters specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> as educational attainment <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing-educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tended to be a larger cleavage</a> for them than for other racial or ethnic groups. Biden won 54 percent of white men with a college degree, up from Clinton’s 47 percent in 2016, while white women without a four-year degree moved in the other direction, as Trump’s support grew to 64 percent, up from 56 percent in 2016. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/best-2020-post-mortem-tells-us-electorate-78700694</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, educational attainment isn’t the whole story, as white men without a college degree also shifted significantly toward Biden in 2020. Although Trump still won that group by a huge margin, Biden won 31 percent of them compared with Clinton’s 23 percent — an improvement that may have been foreshadowed by Biden’s performance in the presidential primary, in which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-is-joe-biden-remaking-the-2016-primary-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he did notably better</a> than Clinton in many parts of the country with higher shares of white voters without a college degree.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, another factor in the narrowing gender gap, especially for men, may have been the nature of Biden’s candidacy. As a white man in his late 70s, he <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-clintons-loss-paved-the-way-for-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have simply come across</a> as <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/09/16/liberal-moderate-conservative-trump-biden-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more moderate</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-say-they-would-vote-for-a-woman-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have also been less likely</a> to elicit sexist reactions among male voters than <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-unconscious-sexism-could-help-explain-trumps-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton did in 2016</a>. This is reflected in the gains Biden made among men — there isn’t one clear pattern. Biden gained among men with and without a college degree. But he also gained among white men overall, winning 40 percent of that group, up from Clinton’s 32 percent in 2016. Additionally, Biden won 44 percent of married men — married voters <a href="http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/127/the-effect-of-marriage-on-political-identification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be more conservative-leaning</a> than unmarried voters — which marked a major improvement over Clinton’s 32 percent in 2016. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, Biden won 52 percent of independents, up from Clinton’s 42 percent, and 16 percent of moderate or liberal Republicans, doubling Clinton’s 8 percent. In other words, in an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-biden-blowout-didnt-happen-and-why-a-2024-blowout-is-unlikely-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">era of political trench warfare</a>, elements of Biden’s identity and political profile may have been just enough for him to appeal to a broad swath of the electorate, narrowing the gender gap <em>and</em> winning the election in the process.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/2020-voter-demographics/619337/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other surveys don’t align as neatly</a> with some of Pew’s findings, and the reality is we’ll never know with absolute certainty how different groups voted last November. Nevertheless, this study offers another look at what happened in 2020 and the broader trends in the American electorate, including the possibility that the longstanding gender gap may have narrowed last November.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>In June, Republican pollster Echelon Insights <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/june-omnibus-quadrants/">examined how cultural and economic attitudes</a> relate to partisanship, and one survey question asked which sort of political party respondents would back if the U.S. had more than two major parties. Twenty-four percent of registered voters said they identified with a Trump-like nationalist party bent on stopping illegal immigration and “putting America first,” while 19 percent said they would support a more traditional conservative party that would “defend” free enterprise and “promote traditional family values.” Tellingly, 83 percent of nationalist party supporters and 78 percent of conservative party supporters backed Trump in the 2020 election. Meanwhile, 26 percent of voters said they would support a labor-oriented party looking to expand the social safety net, while 9 percent would back a green party promoting environmental, social and economic justice. Lastly, 10 percent said they would support a socially liberal but fiscally conservative “<a href="https://www.travel-industry-dictionary.com/acela-corridor.html">Acela</a>” party. At least 80 percent of those who identified with the latter three parties voted for Biden in 2020.</li><li>As vaccinations against COVID-19 become widespread and the economy reopens, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/351932/americans-life-ratings-reach-record-high.aspx">Gallup’s measure</a> of how Americans evaluate their own well-being found a record 59.2 percent “thriving,” according to the pollster’s categorization. This represented a marked shift from the low of 46.4 percent who said the same in April 2020, when the coronavirus was causing shutdowns and thousands of deaths. Notably, though, Americans’ reported life satisfaction and anticipated well-being is higher now than it was even before the pandemic.</li><li><a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/most-americans-now-comfortable-being-unmasked-indoors-public">Newsy/Ipsos found</a> that a large majority of Americans were at least somewhat comfortable behaving as they did before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Overall, 86 percent of employed workers said they were comfortable working outside the home, and 69 percent of all respondents said they were OK with being in a public place indoors without a mask. In terms of personal interactions, 64 percent said they were comfortable hugging another person, and 60 percent said they were comfortable shaking hands.</li><li>The latest weekly survey from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/y4ic1h9zy9/econTabReport.pdf">The Economist/YouGov</a> asked Americans about climate change, and 61 percent said the world’s climate was changing due to human activity, while 30 percent said the climate was changing but not because of human activity (9 percent said the climate wasn’t changing at all). Considering the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-jay-inslee-could-win-the-2020-democratic-nomination/">political divide over climate change</a>, there were notable partisan splits on this question. Eighty-six percent of Democrats, 60 percent of independents and 32 percent of Republicans agreed that human activity was behind climate change, while 50 percent of Republicans, 32 percent of independents and 11 percent of Democrats said the climate was changing but humans weren’t responsible. Overall, though, the pollster didn’t find much movement on this question, as responses were similar back in <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/03/09/westerners-are-most-likely-have-felt-climate-chang">March 2018</a>.</li><li>According to <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/561850-poll-51-percent-of-voters-say-indictment-of-trump-org-cfo">The Hill/HarrisX</a>, Americans are pretty evenly divided over why <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/manhattan-da-charges-trumps-company-cfo-tax-fraud/story?id=78535462">Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg</a> was indicted. Fifty-one percent of registered voters said the charges for tax fraud and other alleged crimes were politically motivated, while 49 percent said that prosecutors had uncovered criminal behavior. Unsurprisingly, 75 percent of Republicans said the indictment was politically motivated versus 70 percent of Democrats, who said the charges were due to criminal behavior.</li><li><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2021/07/07/wedding-traditions-poll">YouGov</a> asked Americans who have been married whether they thought certain marriage traditions should be preserved or dropped. Overall, most traditions were still widely popular, but pluralities of respondents did want to drop two long-standing practices: 50 percent wanted to quit having the bride promise to obey her husband (32 percent wanted to preserve that tradition), and 43 percent wanted to stop having the bride’s family pay for the wedding (25 percent wanted to preserve this). However, women — and not men — seemed to be the ones primarily driving this: 61 percent of women wanted to do away with promising to obey their husbands (versus 38 percent of men), and 52 percent didn’t want the bride’s family to have to pay for the wedding (versus 34 percent of men).</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

	</aside><p data-paragraph="main">This week marks six months since pro-Trump extremists attacked the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the electoral votes in the 2020 election. It was an attempt to overturn a free and fair election, as the people involved in the attack wrongly believed it was not free or fair. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, technology and politics reporter Kaleigh Rogers discusses the influence of conspiracy theories on the events that led to the Jan. 6 riot, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-people-fall-for-conspiracy-theories/">why people believe in conspiracy theories</a> in the first place and what it means for the future of American politics.</p>
