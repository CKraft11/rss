			<description><![CDATA[
<p data-paragraph="main">Donald Trump is still the undisputed leader of the Republican Party. But you probably already knew that. The medley of conservative voters, politicians, activists and political commentators that descended on Dallas this past weekend for this year’s second <a href="https://cpac.conservative.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conservative Political Action Conference</a> certainly did. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some things are less clear. Namely, ahead of the midterm elections, GOP voters seem to be casting about for the best path forward and debating whether their energy would be better utilized by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/10/ken-paxton-donald-trump-election-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relitigating the results of last year’s presidential race</a> (again) or chugging forward to what’s expected to be a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republican-trump-2022-midterms-election-falsehoods/2021/07/04/3a43438c-d36f-11eb-ae54-515e2f63d37d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grueling midterm cycle</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This schism amongst Republicans was on display throughout the weekend. Take, for example, a conversation I had with James Scott, a once-reluctant Trump supporter who’s now all in. After retrieving a hot coffee on the second day of CPAC, he sheepishly admitted to me that, back in 2016, he “held his nose” before voting for the now-former president. Standing across from me with a “<a href="https://thechosengifts.com/products/come-and-see-chosen-hat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Come and See</a>” baseball cap, the bespectacled retiree described his past self as a “Marco Rubio aficionado” who joined Team Trump only after Trump announced an ultra-conservative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/politics/donald-trump-supreme-court-nominees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court shortlist</a> ahead of the 2016 general election. And now, Scott is so devoted that he believes assessing Trump’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baseless lies</a> about rampant election fraud is critical to the GOP’s future. “We must have election integrity,” he told me. The truth, he added, “must be brought out because the future depends on it.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Compare that, though, to 20-year-old Aaron Genus, a college student, Instagram personality and restaurant worker who came to the conference from Michigan. Genus made clear that he, too, believed the 2020 election was “an absolute joke;” but unlike Scott, he’s ready for the party to move on. “In America, there’s no such thing as an election do-over,” he said. “Once Trump got in that helicopter and waved goodbye, it was over. There’s no way to undo what happened. All we can do is fight for our election integrity come the next two cycles.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Heading into CPAC, I was curious where voters’ heads were at. How preoccupied would attendees be with rehashing 2020 versus looking ahead to 2022? In years past, CPAC has been a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cpac-brief-history-conservative-movement-120815471.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful barometer</a> for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/25/donald-trump-cpac-republicans-allies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base of the Republican Party</a> and its most fervent activists — even if it <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/cpac-straw-poll-winners-dont-always-become-gop-nominees/448083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t always indicative</a> of the party’s future. This year was no exception, although the choice of whether to press on from the previous election is arguably a new one.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A bevy of speakers decried claims of a stolen election (though they are false), and <a href="https://cpac.conservative.org/agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least two events</a> were devoted exclusively to how to spot and guard against election fraud. Other panels focused on how to expand the party’s base, and ahead of Trump’s culminating speech, an emcee declared that “2022 starts right here.” What I found, though, is that only a small handful of attendees were actually ready to move on.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/democrats-republicans-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing the U.S. House in 2018</a> and the Senate and White House in 2020, Republicans are eager to identify candidates who can help them successfully reclaim Congress in 2022 and the presidency in 2024. But if this weekend’s CPAC conference is any indication of the party’s priorities, some of the staunchest Republicans are more concerned about challenging the last election than winning the next. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I still feel we were so cheated in 2020 and I don’t think that’s been resolved,” attendee Pat DeLange, who turned 63 on Saturday, told me. “So when there is cheating involved it needs to be exposed. I think we need to get the rightful president back in office so he can fix this and wake people up.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trump, for his part, seemed more concerned with the past, too. If nothing else, it’s one way for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/07/trump-post-presidency-plans-434324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">him to maintain relevance</a> as the party’s de facto leader while he irons out his future plans. During a roughly 90-minute speech on Sunday, he mentioned — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/12/politics/analysis-trump-election-lies-blog-post-presidency/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar to prior interviews and appearances</a> — a “rigged election” and sarcastically quipped that he “lost” last year’s race. (The crowd went wild at these bits, repeatedly booing at claims of fraud.) But perhaps most notably, he continued to tease supporters on whether he’ll run again. (“I will never stop fighting for you,” he told a brimming crowd, which chanted back, “Four more years!”)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, considering Trump’s grip on the party — 53 percent of self-identified Republicans said in a May <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/53-republicans-view-trump-true-us-president-reutersipsos-2021-05-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> opinion poll that they believe he is the “true president”  — it’s not surprising that supporters are still overwhelmingly taking cues from the former president. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent polls on who won the 2020 election confirm</a> that much of the party <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-republicans-distrust-this-years-election-results-than-democrats-after-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t over last year</a>, either. In November, roughly three in four Trump supporters said Biden’s win was due to voter fraud, per a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_111820.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth University poll</a>. And those numbers have barely budged. According to that May Reuters/Ipsos <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-05/Ipsos%20Reuters%20Topline%20Write%20up-%20The%20Big%20Lie%20-%2017%20May%20thru%2019%20May%202021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>, 56 percent of Republicans still believe the election was rigged. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Experts I spoke to ahead of the convention said they’ve never seen a past president maintain his position as head of a political party as Trump has, but they weren’t shocked with the crowd’s obsession with the past either. “It’s not a real future-oriented crowd. I’d say they’re more interested in what they see as [a] fraudulent election and litigating all that,” said <a href="http://hs.umt.edu/polsci/people/default.php?s=Saldin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Saldin</a>, a professor of political science at the University of Montana. “But it’s always been a backwards looking thing. ‘Make America Great Again’ is casting a tide to the past, so I think, in a way, there’s always been a backwards focus there that’s been relatively rare in American politics.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, fealty to Trump (and, by virtue, his false claims of fraud) were a key theme of the weekend. Not only were attendees there wearing a sea of red, white and blue outfits and accessories bearing Trump’s face and name, they overwhelmingly selected Trump as their preferred candidate for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/562472-trump-desantis-lead-cpac-straw-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the CPAC straw poll</a>. He captured 70 percent of the ballots in the anonymous survey — a boost from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/02/28/trump-wins-cpac-straw-poll-with-florida-gov-ron-desantis-his-closest-contender/?sh=f67a23934ea9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 percent</a> he won in a similar poll at the Orlando CPAC conference in February. Also during the conference, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbraddock/status/1413904794335420417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attendees circulated</a> a seven-point plot to reinstate Trump as president in a matter of days. (There’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-trump-cant-be-reinstated-as-president-by-august-2021-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no constitutional mechanism</a> for reinstating a former president.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, those who want to leave 2020 behind were at the conference, too, but they were a minority. On the last day of CPAC, I found Grizzly Joe, a Trump supporter who received national attention <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/07/10/cpac-trump-supporters-dallas-osullivan-sot-nr-vpx.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for telling CNN</a> he believed Biden was the true winner of the November election. (While he had media credentials for the event, he told me he was half there for coverage and half there as an attendee.) “Looking in the rearview mirror isn’t going to help us move forward,” he told me. When I asked him whether there’s too much focus right now on debunked claims of fraud, he told me that, “some people are like a dog with a bone. If there’s fraud let’s find it, root it out and fix it. … But people jumping up and down bellyaching about Trump being the real president isn’t going to put Trump back in the White House.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A second conversation with Barbara Lewis, 65, who wore a Trump 2024 shirt and blue leggings with red and white stars, yielded much of the same sentiment. “They fought the [last] election enough, and the fight kind of just needs to end. I don’t think they can go any further with the fight.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s too early to say where the Republican Party will go from here, but at least for now, it’s clear that Trump and the 2020 election are still very resonant in voters’ minds. And that makes perfect sense considering Trump himself has a foot in both the past and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-endorsements-republicans/2021/06/26/86228924-d465-11eb-ae54-515e2f63d37d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the future</a>. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
<p data-paragraph="main">In the 1960s and 70s, conservatives were waging a war against what they considered an existential threat infiltrating America’s public schools. Pamphlets were circulated by the John Birch Society, a right-wing extremist group, declaring it a “<a href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2613&amp;context=open_access_etds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filthy Communist plot</a>.” And then-Governor Ronald Reagan of California decried it as a “moral crisis” that needed to be eradicated. What was poisoning the minds of America’s youth? Sex education.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These days, sex ed is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more widely accepted</a>, especially <a href="https://time.com/3578597/aids-sex-ed-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the HIV/AIDS epidemic</a> (though conservatives have still managed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/conservatives-propose-revised-sex-ed-rules-lgbtq-pushback-77073959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to beat back more progressive school curricula</a> when it comes to sexual health), but the Republican Party’s habit of identifying a bogeyman in America’s education system hasn’t wavered. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then it was sex ed. Now, it’s critical race theory.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Critical race theory is <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a legal scholarship framework</a> that has been around in academia for four decades and asserts that racism is systemic and embedded in many American institutions. But over the past few months, the term has been co-opted by Republicans as a catch-all buzzword to signify <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/06/what-is-critical-race-theory-is-it-really-taught-in-schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the perceived threat</a> of anti-white indoctrination in American schools. This has motivated a slate of proposed legislation outlawing a wide range of teachings. Since the start of this year, at least six states have enacted bans on the teaching of critical race theory or discussions of racism in the classrooms, according to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/07/02/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brookings Institute</a> analysis, while almost 20 other states have introduced similar bills. Moreover, <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/republicans-in-5-states-seek-to-keep-1619-project-curriculum-out-of-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of states</a>, like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-race-and-ethnicity-government-and-politics-education-74d0af6c52c0009ec3fa3ee9955b0a8d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/15/abbott-critical-race-theory-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a>, have also successfully banned the teaching of the <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/lesson-plan-grouping/1619-project-curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times’s 1619 Project</a> curriculum, which explores the central role of slavery in the development of the U.S. The project <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/why-conservatives-want-cancel-1619-project/618952/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been harshly criticized</a> by conservatives who have accused its writers of recasting history through a racial lens. To be sure, the bills vary. Some bills mention critical race theory directly, while others only reference bans on “<a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText21/HouseText21/H6070.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divisive concepts</a>” or any teachings that imply “<a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2021-22%20ENR/hB/HB1775%20ENR.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one race or sex is inherently superior</a>.” But this concerted effort to limit what can be taught in our schools isn’t new — it’s the latest chapter in the GOP’s long-standing push to target curricula that goes against its political ideology. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republican attacks on cultural issues within America’s public schools follow a familiar pattern. First, they’re usually in response to a vague idea of what <em>might </em>happen — that is, teaching sexual health <a href="https://www.kqed.org/education/534518/sex-education-in-america-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>might</em> lead to more school-aged teenagers having sex</a> (although there’s actually <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/fewer-american-high-schoolers-having-sex-than-ever-before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been a decline</a> in the percentage of American high schoolers having sex since the early 1990s). Second, when there is a debate over teaching often taboo, complex social issues, like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-business-education-government-and-politics-905c354a805cec1785160cf21f04c7ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racism</a>, <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/essay/darwin-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolution</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/28/whats-the-best-way-to-teach-sex-ed-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sex</a>, elected school board members can exert an outsized amount of control. Considering school board members are <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/why-school-board-diversity-matters/2020/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to be white and are often partisan</a>, Republicans’ political agenda <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858418818074" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can get a disproportionate amount of weight</a> in school board decisions. And if the contemporary Republican Party has taught us anything as of late, it’s that “anti-wokeness” is political <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catnip for its base</a>, so it’s unlikely that this crusade goes away any time soon. In fact, because critical race theory deals so explicitly with racism and discrimination, it has arguably <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animated the GOP base</a> in a way that previous education battles haven’t. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">One of the oldest education battles revolves around the teaching of evolution. It’s one that until recently didn’t have clearly drawn partisan lines. After all, the most famous example of a legislative attempt to prohibit teaching evolution in schools was actually introduced by a Democrat: a 1925 Tennessee state law to ban teaching evolution in schools. That <a href="https://www.npr.org/2005/07/05/4723956/timeline-remembering-the-scopes-monkey-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law was later challenged in a showy court case</a> (complete with chimpanzees) that same year, where it was upheld, and ultimately not repealed until 1967. (It was also a Democrat who introduced a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/12/10/creationism-case-raises-issues-of-faith-freedom/ce2bf87f-513d-4ea3-95f8-dab73dfc93a8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1981 bill in Louisiana’s state legislature</a> that mandated the teaching of “creation science” — which presents religious beliefs as alternative scientific theories — whenever evolution was taught. The Supreme Court has since banned states from <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-06-20-mn-8487-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring creation science</a> to be taught, but it has remained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/24/bobby-jindal-republican-creationism-2016-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a popular conservative cultural flashpoint</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the last two decades, Republicans at the state level have introduced <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ssqu.12267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 bills</a> aimed at undermining evolution, through tactics such as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/316487-new-wave-of-anti-evolution-bills-hit-states?rl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowing teachers to “question” established scientific concepts</a>. Most of these bills never go anywhere — a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ssqu.12267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 study</a> found just six anti-evolution bills out of 110 introduced between 2000 and 2012 were enacted into law — but the fact that legislatures keep proposing them means one of the U.S. public education system’s oldest bogeyman is still alive and well.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Similarly, sex education in public schools has long been a target of Republicans, although once it became clear that sex education programs actually help <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/whatworks/what-works-sexual-health-education.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the risk of teen pregnancy and STIs and delay the age</a> when teens become sexually active, sex ed became more socially accepted. This means that Republicans opposed to sex ed have had to change their strategy to curtailing what’s taught. Sixteen states, for instance, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require educators to “stress” abstinence education</a> and do not require anything be taught about contraception, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advances sexual and reproductive health and rights.<a data-footnote-id="1" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every bill was introduced by Republican lawmakers, but the majority were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Another popular strategy is giving <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/education/florida-parents-can-opt-their-students-out-of-sex-education-with-newly-signed-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parents the right</a> to opt their child out of sex ed, or making <a href="https://azednews.com/senate-hears-bill-that-would-require-parents-to-opt-in-not-opt-out-for-sex-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sex ed opt-in</a> to begin with. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And more recently, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/7/18088680/common-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beginning in the late 2000s</a>, a culture war clash emerged following the adoption of the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-debate-over-common-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a> — a set of K-12 academic standards that was aggressively pushed by the federal government. While the initiative was designed to promote a good education by giving students specific guidelines about what they should know, grade by grade, in subjects like math and English language arts, it <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/common-core-education-reform-backlash-obamacare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced fierce opposition from Republicans</a> and Democrats alike. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But around 2015, the Core standards became especially politicized by <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/08/gop-education-summit-six-candidates-meet-with-campbell-brown-in-new-hampshire.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians on the right</a> who thought curriculum standards should be left to local officials. For instance, when Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/09/25/494740056/donald-trumps-plan-for-americas-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran for the White House in 2016</a>, his early ads argued that “education has to be at a local level.” And in 2018, Trump’s former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos falsely declared the Common Core was “<a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-us-education-secretary-betsy-devos-american-enterprise-institute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dead</a>” — even though it’s up to individual states, and not the federal government, whether to ditch the Core standards.<a data-footnote-id="2" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-2" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, more than 40 states passed laws adopting the Common Core standards in their schools. But &lt;a href="https://www.achieve.org/files/StrongStandards_032919.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than 20 states&lt;/a&gt; have now revised, repealed or rolled back parts of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s clear culture war issues have always had a place in how Republicans think about education, but as Terry Moe, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank, told us, Republicans also used to advocate for more policy-focused solutions. He pointed to Republican-led initiatives like the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/27/443110755/no-child-left-behind-what-worked-what-didnt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Child Left Behind Act</a>, which, in part, sought to use standardized testing to help improve student achievement. These kinds of initiatives have since <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-child-has-failed/2015/02/13/8d619026-b2f8-11e4-827f-93f454140e2b_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received their own criticism</a>, but they represent a very different strategy than the one that currently dominates the Republican Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The Republican Party has really gotten further and further away from being a party of ideas about how to solve social problems — one of them being an education system that does not perform very well — and becoming a party of anger and resentment. That’s what they specialize in now,” Moe said. “They are, for the most part, fighting a culture war against the Democrats and trying to pander to their base.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, critical race theory fits perfectly into the Republicans’ agenda, as it’s a cultural bugbear that conservatives have co-opted to encompass a range of trends they think are unpopular with Americans. (One of the lead architects pushing the anti-critical race theory backlash, Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210609235759/https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1371541044592996352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said as much</a>.) This is particularly true for topics centered specifically around race. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They’re worried about what happens when a reckoning takes hold in their kids’ schools where their kids might learn some things about American history — or about themselves or people like them — that are uncomfortable truths,” said Hakeem Jefferson, a FiveThirtyEight contributor and professor of political science at Stanford University. “This is merely another example of white Americans using schools as sites of their racial political projects, which set out to maintain dominance and do so by way of not telling the full truth of American history.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Many Americans still don’t know what the debate over critical race theory is really about at this point. Just 24 percent have heard “a lot” about it, 25 percent know “some” and 51 percent know little or nothing at all, according to a June <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017a-36ee-d33b-a37f-3eee757a0000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=2fabe135-eaca-4acf-a36a-a0e8fde3c741&amp;nlid=630318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult/Politico</a> poll. But tellingly, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to have seen, heard or read a lot about critical race theory, 30 percent versus 21 percent. What’s more, those Republicans familiar with critical race theory overwhelmingly dislike it — 78 percent have a negative opinion of it compared to 7 percent of Democrats. When asked to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/23/critical-race-theory-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describe</a> critical race theory in that same survey, one Republican respondent called critical race theory “a farce,” while another said it was a “Marxist proposal.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Considering how much more exposure Republicans have had to it — a <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-has-mentioned-critical-race-theory-nearly-1300-times-past-35-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Media Matters analysis</a> shows Fox News has mentioned critical race theory 1,300 times in less than four months, and a query of data on the social media tool CrowdTangle <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinReuning/status/1401166962575749123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from researchers</a> at Miami University and Wright State University found that the share of posts that mention critical race theory on the Facebook pages of local Republican parties has risen exponentially — the blowback among members of the GOP is not entirely surprising. It’s also not just the volume of coverage: The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-joy-reid-conflates-opposing-critical-race-theory-supporting-qanon-radicalized-parent-activists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative media’s coverage</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-critical-race-theory-crazed-ideologues-attack-hurt-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of critical race theory is</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly negative</a>, too, as it’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2021/05/09/the-war-on-critical-race-theory-continues-as-some-call-it-anti-white/?sh=6c0fba1373a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decried by some on the right</a> as anti-white.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans have long fought specters within education that they claim threaten the American way of life. The current blowback against critical race theory follows in that tradition, but it also represents a broader transformation of the GOP into a populist party focused on waging culture wars. Though it may seem like a misguided crusade-du-jour, the tumult around critical race theory is both a reflection of the Republican Party’s past — and a glimpse at its future. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong><div><hr><span></span></div>
</strong></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s been said that women are from Venus and men are from Mars. Broadly speaking, that’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Are_from_Mars,_Women_Are_from_Venus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a laughable bit of pop psychology</a>, but there’s a measure of truth to it when it comes to politics. That’s because women have voted notably more Democratic than men in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-won-the-right-to-vote-100-years-ago-they-didnt-start-voting-differently-from-men-until-1980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every presidential race since 1980</a> — and the 2020 contest between Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-men-stuck-with-trump-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was no different</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study of validated voters from the Pew Research Center</a> suggests, however, that the gender gap — or how women voted compared with men — meaningfully narrowed from 2016 to 2020. Pew found that 55 percent of women supported Biden compared with 48 percent of men, a gender gap of 7 percentage points.<a data-footnote-id="3" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-3" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calculating the gender gap is tricky, as it &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-gender-gap-was-huge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has been measured&lt;/a&gt; several ways. Sometimes it is calculated in terms of vote share margin (or the distance between the relative advantage one candidate or party has among men and the relative advantage that candidate or party has among women). The &lt;a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender_gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Center for American Women and Politics&lt;/a&gt; at Rutgers University recommends measuring the gender gap by the difference in male and female support for a particular candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> This marked a 6-point reduction from the 13-point gap Pew found in 2016, when 39 percent of women and 52 percent of men backed Trump. And the gender gap seems to have shrunk for two main reasons. First, Biden significantly improved his standing among men — he won 48 percent of men versus Hillary Clinton’s 41 percent. Second, Trump significantly improved his standing among women — he won 44 percent of women in 2020 versus 39 percent in 2016.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s harder to pinpoint exactly <em>why</em> the gender gap shrunk from 2016 to 2020, but Pew’s numbers point to a couple of possible explanations, particularly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the influence that educational attainment has on vote choice</a>. Consider Biden’s improvement among college-educated men. He won 58 percent of this group, a giant leap from Clinton’s 49 percent in 2016. And his performance among college-educated men marked a 10-point advantage over how he did among men overall. Conversely for Trump, his gains among women were largely concentrated among those without a four-year college degree. His support among that group grew from 43 percent in 2016 to 50 percent in 2020. Taken together, this reflects the recent trend of Americans with higher education levels <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifting toward the Democrats</a>, and less-well-educated Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/in-changing-u-s-electorate-race-and-education-remain-stark-dividing-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving toward the GOP</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This shift was especially notable among white voters,<a data-footnote-id="4" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we mean non-Hispanic white voters specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> as educational attainment <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing-educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has tended to be a larger cleavage</a> for them than for other racial or ethnic groups. Biden won 54 percent of white men with a college degree, up from Clinton’s 47 percent in 2016, while white women without a four-year degree moved in the other direction, as Trump’s support grew to 64 percent, up from 56 percent in 2016. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/best-2020-post-mortem-tells-us-electorate-78700694</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Yet, educational attainment isn’t the whole story, as white men without a college degree also shifted significantly toward Biden in 2020. Although Trump still won that group by a huge margin, Biden won 31 percent of them compared with Clinton’s 23 percent — an improvement that may have been foreshadowed by Biden’s performance in the presidential primary, in which <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-is-joe-biden-remaking-the-2016-primary-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he did notably better</a> than Clinton in many parts of the country with higher shares of white voters without a college degree.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, another factor in the narrowing gender gap, especially for men, may have been the nature of Biden’s candidacy. As a white man in his late 70s, he <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-clintons-loss-paved-the-way-for-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have simply come across</a> as <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/09/16/liberal-moderate-conservative-trump-biden-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more moderate</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-say-they-would-vote-for-a-woman-but/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have also been less likely</a> to elicit sexist reactions among male voters than <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-unconscious-sexism-could-help-explain-trumps-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton did in 2016</a>. This is reflected in the gains Biden made among men — there isn’t one clear pattern. Biden gained among men with and without a college degree. But he also gained among white men overall, winning 40 percent of that group, up from Clinton’s 32 percent in 2016. Additionally, Biden won 44 percent of married men — married voters <a href="http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/127/the-effect-of-marriage-on-political-identification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tend to be more conservative-leaning</a> than unmarried voters — which marked a major improvement over Clinton’s 32 percent in 2016. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">More broadly, Biden won 52 percent of independents, up from Clinton’s 42 percent, and 16 percent of moderate or liberal Republicans, doubling Clinton’s 8 percent. In other words, in an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-biden-blowout-didnt-happen-and-why-a-2024-blowout-is-unlikely-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">era of political trench warfare</a>, elements of Biden’s identity and political profile may have been just enough for him to appeal to a broad swath of the electorate, narrowing the gender gap <em>and</em> winning the election in the process.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/2020-voter-demographics/619337/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other surveys don’t align as neatly</a> with some of Pew’s findings, and the reality is we’ll never know with absolute certainty how different groups voted last November. Nevertheless, this study offers another look at what happened in 2020 and the broader trends in the American electorate, including the possibility that the longstanding gender gap may have narrowed last November.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>In June, Republican pollster Echelon Insights <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/june-omnibus-quadrants/">examined how cultural and economic attitudes</a> relate to partisanship, and one survey question asked which sort of political party respondents would back if the U.S. had more than two major parties. Twenty-four percent of registered voters said they identified with a Trump-like nationalist party bent on stopping illegal immigration and “putting America first,” while 19 percent said they would support a more traditional conservative party that would “defend” free enterprise and “promote traditional family values.” Tellingly, 83 percent of nationalist party supporters and 78 percent of conservative party supporters backed Trump in the 2020 election. Meanwhile, 26 percent of voters said they would support a labor-oriented party looking to expand the social safety net, while 9 percent would back a green party promoting environmental, social and economic justice. Lastly, 10 percent said they would support a socially liberal but fiscally conservative “<a href="https://www.travel-industry-dictionary.com/acela-corridor.html">Acela</a>” party. At least 80 percent of those who identified with the latter three parties voted for Biden in 2020.</li><li>As vaccinations against COVID-19 become widespread and the economy reopens, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/351932/americans-life-ratings-reach-record-high.aspx">Gallup’s measure</a> of how Americans evaluate their own well-being found a record 59.2 percent “thriving,” according to the pollster’s categorization. This represented a marked shift from the low of 46.4 percent who said the same in April 2020, when the coronavirus was causing shutdowns and thousands of deaths. Notably, though, Americans’ reported life satisfaction and anticipated well-being is higher now than it was even before the pandemic.</li><li><a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/most-americans-now-comfortable-being-unmasked-indoors-public">Newsy/Ipsos found</a> that a large majority of Americans were at least somewhat comfortable behaving as they did before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Overall, 86 percent of employed workers said they were comfortable working outside the home, and 69 percent of all respondents said they were OK with being in a public place indoors without a mask. In terms of personal interactions, 64 percent said they were comfortable hugging another person, and 60 percent said they were comfortable shaking hands.</li><li>The latest weekly survey from <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/y4ic1h9zy9/econTabReport.pdf">The Economist/YouGov</a> asked Americans about climate change, and 61 percent said the world’s climate was changing due to human activity, while 30 percent said the climate was changing but not because of human activity (9 percent said the climate wasn’t changing at all). Considering the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-jay-inslee-could-win-the-2020-democratic-nomination/">political divide over climate change</a>, there were notable partisan splits on this question. Eighty-six percent of Democrats, 60 percent of independents and 32 percent of Republicans agreed that human activity was behind climate change, while 50 percent of Republicans, 32 percent of independents and 11 percent of Democrats said the climate was changing but humans weren’t responsible. Overall, though, the pollster didn’t find much movement on this question, as responses were similar back in <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/03/09/westerners-are-most-likely-have-felt-climate-chang">March 2018</a>.</li><li>According to <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/561850-poll-51-percent-of-voters-say-indictment-of-trump-org-cfo">The Hill/HarrisX</a>, Americans are pretty evenly divided over why <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/manhattan-da-charges-trumps-company-cfo-tax-fraud/story?id=78535462">Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg</a> was indicted. Fifty-one percent of registered voters said the charges for tax fraud and other alleged crimes were politically motivated, while 49 percent said that prosecutors had uncovered criminal behavior. Unsurprisingly, 75 percent of Republicans said the indictment was politically motivated versus 70 percent of Democrats, who said the charges were due to criminal behavior.</li><li><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2021/07/07/wedding-traditions-poll">YouGov</a> asked Americans who have been married whether they thought certain marriage traditions should be preserved or dropped. Overall, most traditions were still widely popular, but pluralities of respondents did want to drop two long-standing practices: 50 percent wanted to quit having the bride promise to obey her husband (32 percent wanted to preserve that tradition), and 43 percent wanted to stop having the bride’s family pay for the wedding (25 percent wanted to preserve this). However, women — and not men — seemed to be the ones primarily driving this: 61 percent of women wanted to do away with promising to obey their husbands (versus 38 percent of men), and 52 percent didn’t want the bride’s family to have to pay for the wedding (versus 34 percent of men).</li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

			<title>Whether Republicans Get Vaccinated Has A Lot To Do With If They Watch Fox News … Or OANN</title>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s no secret that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/321116/americans-remain-distrustful-mass-media.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans <em>really</em> distrust the media</a>. In fact, that distrust is increasingly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-being-anti-media-is-now-part-of-the-gop-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an important part of their political identity.</a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For a long time, understanding where Republicans primarily got their news was pretty straightforward, too. Unlike Democrats, Republicans, by and large, turn to <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/01/24/u-s-media-polarization-and-the-2020-election-a-nation-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just one source for all their news</a>: Fox News. But with <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/could-fox-news-lose-its-grip-on-far-right-conservative-viewers-to-newsmax-oan/ar-BB1c6fc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the advent of news networks even further to the right</a> than Fox News — One America News Network and Newsmax — that’s changing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">OANN and Newsmax still <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2021/03/23/large-majorities-of-newsmax-and-oan-news-consumers-also-go-to-fox-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make up just a small sliver of Americans’ overall media diet</a>, and there’s, of course, a lot of overlap in viewership between those two networks and Fox News. But there are some signs that OANN and Newsmax are replacing Fox News as the primary news sources for at least some Republicans. I’m the research director at the Public Religion Research Institute, and <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/prri-ifyc-covid-vaccine-religion-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a March survey we conducted with Interfaith Youth Core on COVID-19 and conspiracy beliefs</a>, we found that Fox News had fallen in popularity among Republicans, with just 27 percent saying it was their go-to news source versus <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/trumpism-after-trump-how-fox-news-structures-republican-attitudes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent last September</a>. What’s more, 7 percent of Republicans listed a far-right news network they preferred instead. That means they took the time to type in an “other” response in our text-box field, as it was not provided as a choice.<a data-footnote-id="6" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some respondents listed other conservative media outlets like The Blaze, The Daily Wire or The Epoch Times, but OANN and Newsmax were by far the most commonly provided outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> Only a handful did this in September 2020.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, this shift is small — Fox News is still king among Republicans. But the growing popularity of OANN and Newsmax is important: According to our research, Republicans’ stances on certain issues might be better predicted by their television news habits than by whether they identify as conservative, moderate or liberal.<a data-footnote-id="7" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, we did find a correlation between ideology and which news sources Republicans trust, with Republicans who turn to far-right news sources identifying as more conservative, but even after accounting for ideology and demographics in our analysis, we found that which media sources Republicans trust explain at least some of the variation we see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We found in our survey, for instance, that Republicans who got their news from OANN or Newsmax were generally more extreme in their beliefs around QAnon and in their refusal to get vaccinated than those who got their news from Fox News. Meanwhile, Fox News Republicans were often more in line with Republicans who got their news from other mainstream outlets.<a data-footnote-id="8" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included all major broadcast (ABC, CBS, NBC), local television, and public broadcast networks (PBS, CSPAN), in addition to CNN and MSNBC in our “mainstream” news category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> Considering<a href="https://www.prri.org/research/trumpism-after-trump-how-fox-news-structures-republican-attitudes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> Fox News Republicans <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/trumpism-after-trump-how-fox-news-structures-republican-attitudes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were once touted as the Republicans with the most extreme views</a>, this signals a real change in the conservative media landscape and suggests that media habits are as important for understanding Republican voters as ideology. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Some of the most substantial daylight we observed between Fox News Republicans and far-right news Republicans was on their beliefs around conspiracy theories — especially the core beliefs of QAnon. Overall, 23 percent of Republicans mostly or completely agree with the core QAnon tenet that “the government, media, and financial worlds in the U.S. are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation.” But Republicans who trust mainstream news sources or Fox News were actually the least likely to believe in the main QAnon conspiracy theory, with just 19 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, Republicans who don’t watch television news, which notably includes those who get news solely from online sources, were considerably more likely to believe in a system run by Satanist pedophiles (27 percent). But by far, the Republicans who were most likely to believe in QAnon were those who trusted far-right news sources (39 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We found a similar gap in Republicans’ willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Overall, Republicans were among those most likely to say they’re hesitant or resistant to getting vaccinated. But 58 percent of Republicans who get their news from mainstream outlets and 54 percent of Republicans who get their news from Fox News said they had either already received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or would get vaccinated as soon as possible. Just 32 percent of Republicans who get their news from far-right news sources said the same. What’s more, 32 percent of these Republicans said they would refuse the vaccine, versus 11 percent of Republicans who get their news from mainstream outlets and 16 percent of Republicans who get their news from Fox News. That said, all three groups of Republicans expressed similar levels of hesitancy about getting vaccinated — 31 percent of mainstream news Republicans and 29 percent of Fox News Republicans said they weren’t sure if they’d get vaccinated, compared to 37 percent of far-right news Republicans who said the same.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">There was also less of a difference between Fox News Republicans and far-right news Republicans when it came to the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. The vast majority of both groups — 86 percent of Fox News Republicans and 96 percent of far-right news Republicans — said the election was stolen, compared to 66 percent of Republicans who do not watch television news and only 44 percent of mainstream news Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This underscores just how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/upshot/republican-voters-election-doubts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">central the “Big Lie” and baseless allegations of election fraud</a> are to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-republicans-still-wont-accept-that-biden-won/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans’ political identity</a>. While media diets explain some differences that Republicans have, there is still an overlap between those who trust far-right news outlets versus Fox News — especially where Trump is concerned. That said, we did find differences in how strongly Republicans believed the election had been stolen from Trump based on their media preferences: Forty-six percent of Fox News Republicans <em>completely </em>agreed that the election was stolen (whereas 40 percent mostly<em> </em>agreed), but among far-right news Republicans, 74 percent completely<em> </em>agreed (22 percent mostly agreed).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Media preferences don’t explain all the differences we see among Republicans; as noted, on the question of the “Big Lie,” Fox News Republicans are very much not in sync with Republicans who get their news from mainstream news outlets, even if they do hold this belief less strongly than Republicans who get their news from far-right outlets. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, though, Republicans are sorting by news sources in a way that independents and Democrats are not,<a data-footnote-id="9" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/espn_verticals/398#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did not find such effects found among the media sources measured for independents and Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> and that’s shaping at least some of their beliefs in ways that ideology and partisanship alone don’t explain. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We don’t yet know whether Republicans are choosing their different media sources based on preexisting views, or whether the media sources are actively shaping those views. It’s likely that both forces are at play. But what we do know is that far-right news sources are attracting a small but growing proportion of Republicans — many of whom either already held or developed extreme views — while Fox News, once the go-to source for many on the fringe of the party, may no longer be a hotbed for some of the GOP’s most extreme beliefs.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong> </strong>Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>



<div><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): Things got a bit harried in the New York City mayoral primary election last Tuesday afternoon after the Board of Elections <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/nyregion/adams-garcia-wiley-mayor-ranked-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accidentally counted 135,000 test ballots</a> and released results including those ballots. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Board removed the results from its website that evening citing a “discrepancy,” but the erroneous results had shown the race between front-runner Eric Adams and his closest contenders, Kathryn Garcia and Maya Wiley, significantly tightening. This, in turn, sparked accusations around the role ranked-choice voting played in this error, as <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/11/21/top-mayoral-candidate-admonishes-new-voting-system-amidst-efforts-to-delay-it-1337593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">candidates such as Adams</a> are not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/nyregion/yang-garcia-endorsement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fans of the system</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But while ranked-choice voting isn’t the culprit for last week’s mishap — it was Board mismanagement — it did serve to expose some of the debates around ranked-choice voting, including whether it’s a fair system of voting and whether voters even want it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s start there. Why <em>is</em> ranked-choice voting such a hot topic of debate?</p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/best-2020-post-mortem-tells-us-electorate-78700694</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Samuels</a>, politics reporter): Well, for one, it’s still a relatively new system in the U.S., and there are <a href="https://www.politicopro.com/blog/2020-ranked-choice-voting-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conflicting theories</a> on whether it is beneficial (i.e., it helps ensure the winner has the approval of the majority of voters) or detrimental (i.e., it is too complicated or expensive).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But right now, at a time when there’s disillusionment with our election system, the Board of Elections error provides fodder for former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/24/republicans-2020-election-poll-trump-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and his supporters</a> that U.S. elections are inherently fraudulent or illegitimate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst): It’s a change to how we conduct elections, and in a country where most elections are won by the candidate with the most votes without any question about secondary preferences, this is a big change! </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.fairvote.org/where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City is also far and away the largest jurisdiction</a> to employ ranked-choice voting, so the system is very much under the microscope because it’s no longer a curiosity used by a few cities and Maine. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Do we have any sense of whether New Yorkers supported making their elections ranked-choice voting?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Well, New Yorkers overwhelmingly backed the referendum to implement ranked-choice voting in 2019 — <a href="https://vote.nyc/sites/default/files/pdf/election_results/2019/20191105General%20Election/00050100000Citywide%20ELECTIONS%20Citywide%20Recap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">74 percent voted in favor</a>. Granted, 2019 was a low-turnout election in New York considering no major offices were on the ballot. Still, that was a pretty overwhelming vote in support of ranked-choice voting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex: </strong>Before the Board of Elections error, <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/decision-2021/2021/06/09/exclusive--80-percent-of-voters-comfortable-using-ranked-choice-voting--ny1-ipsos-poll-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a NY1/Ipsos poll</a> found that 80 percent of likely Democratic voters said they were comfortable using ranked-choice voting. The New York Times also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/nyregion/nyc-voters-ranked-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed dozens of early voters</a> in New York and found that many people were OK with ranked-choice voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And a day before the Board of Elections fiasco, a poll from Common Cause New York and Rank The Vote NYC found <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/06/28/poll-finds-new-yorkers-overwhelmingly-support-ranked-choice-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 75 percent of voters</a> want to use a ranked system again.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> OK, so it seems fair to say that polls show that New Yorkers overwhelmingly support the idea of ranked-choice voting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why then has ranked-choice voting emerged as a flashpoint in the race with Adams speaking out against it?</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich </strong>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, elections analyst): I think it’s as simple as this: Adams would very likely have won under a first-past-the-post system (31 percent of New York Democrats <a href="https://web.enrboenyc.us/rcv/024306_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked him first</a>, while only 21 percent ranked Wiley first and only 20 percent ranked Garcia first), while Garcia came very close to winning under ranked-choice voting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, if Adams’s chances were improved by ranked-choice voting, then I think he’d be singing a different tune.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Adams’s campaign <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/12/democrats-election-ranked-choice-voting-new-york/617461/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has spoken out against ranked-choice voting</a> and even <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-city-leaders-sue-postpone-ranked-choice-voting/story?id=74629165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed a lawsuit seeking to halt its implementation</a> since he has argued that the system disenfranchises both non-English speakers and voters of color, who might not have the time or resources to properly research every candidate or how the new system works. (According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-were-watching-in-the-new-york-city-mayoral-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our previous analysis of 2019 U.S. Census data</a>, 62 percent of New York City citizens of voting age are nonwhite.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s not entirely clear that ranked-choice voting affects voters of color negatively, at least on the ballot. For example, in California, the voting-reform advocacy group FairVote found that in districts with ranked-choice voting, <a href="https://infogram.com/ranked-choice-voting-and-racial-minority-voting-rights-1hxr4zgwmpk52yo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plurality-white districts that were not white-majority elected a nonwhite representative 60 percent of the time</a>. Before ranked-choice voting, it was only 35 percent of the time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> On the question of turnout, though, this <a href="https://news.sfsu.edu/news-story/ranked-choice-voting-linked-lower-voter-turnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 study of San Francisco’s mayoral races</a> found that ranked-choice voting did, in fact, decrease turnout among Black and white voters, younger voters and voters who lacked a high school education, while the same wasn’t true of more experienced or educated voters, perhaps backing up some of Adams’s claims.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">How mixed is the research on whether ranked-choice voting negatively affects voters of color?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> It’s definitely still an open question to whether ranked-choice voting can help or hurt candidates of color. While <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/06/how-ranked-choice-voting-elevates-women-and-people-of-color-seeking-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some experts say the former</a>, others argue the system could lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/us/politics/ranked-choice-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lone candidate of color getting edged out</a> by opponents who conspire against him or her. As far as voters of color go, though, I’m less clear on that.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There is definitely an age gap in who seems to understand how to use ranked-choice voting. A <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/web.sas.upenn.edu/dist/7/538/files/2019/07/McDaniel-RCV-Voter-Turnout-Revised-ESRA-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 research paper</a> from Jason McDaniel, a professor at San Francisco State University, argues that ranked-choice voting leads to lower voter turnout overall. He cites three researchers who looked into the implementation of ranked-choice voting in Minneapolis, and they found that while most voters understood ranked-choice voting “perfectly” or “fairly well,” older voters were less likely than younger voters to understand the system. Higher education levels were also associated with a better understanding of ranked-choice voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, as Alex noted, some research has found a pretty pronounced age effect, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ssqu.12651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other research</a> has <a href="https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/download/3913/3913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a> on the idea that nonwhite voters are more likely to struggle with ranked-choice voting than voting for only one candidate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> What about other research on ranked-choice voting? That is, does it <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/rcvbenefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help reduce partisanship</a> in elections, as proponents claim? Or make elections less acrimonious?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich</strong>: It doesn’t really live up to the promise of making campaigns less acrimonious. The Democratic primary for New York City mayor was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/nyregion/nyc-mayor-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nasty affair</a>, and there was still plenty of negative campaigning in the 2018 Maine gubernatorial primary, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maine-is-trying-out-a-new-way-to-run-elections-but-will-it-survive-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I wrote at the time</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Although as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/nyregion/yang-garcia-endorsement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw with Garcia and Andrew Yang</a>, ranked-choice voting can lead to candidate alliances that <em>could</em> be an indication of less negativity in a way. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>It’s true that ranked-choice voting may encourage minor candidates to play nice with one another in hopes of picking up the others’ supporters, but it ultimately doesn’t remove the incentive to tear down the front-runner. At the end of the day, a lower-polling candidate still needs to overtake the front-runner to win. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> What about this idea that ranked-choice voting boosts some of the non-major-party vote share? That is, by having multiple choices, voters are encouraged to vote for candidates based on their sincere beliefs versus just voting for the candidate they think will win.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Does ranked-choice voting live up to that promise?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich: </strong>There is some evidence that ranked-choice voting helps third-party candidates, which could be an indication that it makes voters more comfortable voting for their true first choices instead of feeling like they have to choose between Democrats and Republicans for their vote to matter. MIT political scientist Jesse Clark has <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/the-effect-of-ranked-choice-voting-in-maine-44bbb7374847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studied Maine’s elections under ranked-choice voting</a> and found that non-major-party candidates gained 5-6 percentage points because of ranked-choice voting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Yeah, to Nathaniel’s point, <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/results18.html#Nov6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 2018 election</a> for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, about 8 percent of the vote initially went to third-party candidates, but after reallocation in the ranked-choice voting process, Democrat Jared Golden ultimately narrowly defeated Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, ranked-choice voting does seem to boost third-party vote share, as that 8 percent figure would be high for a more typical winner-take-all election.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> FairVote did find, however, that ranked-choice voting doesn’t necessarily increase the chances of <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/third_party_and_independent_representation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third- or independent-party candidate winning</a>. Rather, the benefits, they argue, is that it allows third-party and minor-candidate supporters to rank their preferred candidate first without feeling like their votes are wasted — as third-party votes might be in a more traditional election. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/politics-podcast-summer-mailbag-edition-fivethirtyeight-78499147</p>


<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, the most obvious point in ranked-choice voting’s favor is that it can produce a winner who is truly the preference of a majority of voters in situations when one side’s vote would otherwise be split by a strong third-party challenger.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Golden-Poliquin race is a great example of that. Even though Poliquin won a plurality of first-place votes, it was pretty clear that, once you factored in the preferences of third-party voters, a majority of voters in Maine’s 2nd District that year liked Golden better than Poliquin.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, this kind of results inversion doesn’t happen very often. FairVote has <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lU6viuXfay323Gl6zkH5itwmrUIUo9rAzalK_ntu-ZY/edit#gid=1126870020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracked</a> 398 single-winner ranked-choice voting races in the U.S. since 2004, and 97 percent of them (383) were won by the candidate who got a plurality of first-place votes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Nathaniel, I’ve seen some opponents of the system claim that ranked-choice voting doesn’t necessarily lead to <a href="https://qz.com/1676718/the-pros-and-cons-of-ranked-choice-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a candidate who represents the majority</a>. For example, some voters might end up with their ballots essentially eliminated and <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/e/1083/files/2014/12/ElectoralStudies-2fupfhd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no say in the final outcome</a> if they ranked three out of five candidates, for example, and all three were eliminated. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a 2016 essay, writer Simon Waxman <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/ranked-choice-voting-is-not-the-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argues some of the same points</a>. “[T]here are reasons for skepticism when it comes to [ranked-choice voting] — and not just RCV itself, but the larger notion that what is broken in American politics, and therefore what will fix it, is procedure.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Another concern is that ranked-choice voting <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2519723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks tiring voters out</a> — what’s known as “ballot fatigue” — if they have to rank, say, five candidates for a large number of offices, that could lead them to leave some spots blank or to not even finish voting for all offices or other ballot questions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, no voting system is perfect. Imagine, too, a scenario where there are three candidates: a liberal, a moderate and a conservative. The moderate might be the second choice of both liberal and conservative voters, but if the moderate doesn’t also get more first-place votes than one of the other two, the moderate will be the first one eliminated under ranked-choice voting! That said, ranked-choice voting does seem less imperfect than a straight-up plurality system like most of the U.S. uses — at least when it comes to determining the rightful winner. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are other ways in which ranked-choice voting may be worse, though. For instance, the MIT researcher Clark also found that ranked-choice voting in Maine “produced significantly lower levels of voter confidence, voter satisfaction, and ease of use. It also increased the perception that the voting process was slanted against the respondent’s party.” As we mentioned earlier, that kind of voter confusion could lead to depressed turnout. Plus, further undermining public confidence in our elections is the last thing we need right now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other hand, ranked-choice voting is a new innovation in most of the jurisdictions now using it, including Maine. So I’d guess that those problems could be mitigated once voters start getting used to the system. Better voter education and ballot design could also help.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, I think it’s too early in ranked-choice voting’s lifespan to reach a definitive conclusion about it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Right, as Nathaniel said, ranking candidates is definitely more complicated than selecting just one. But I don’t think there’s sufficient evidence to say it’s a barrier to voting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Maine, turnout for both the <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2018/06/12/new-voting-system-credited-for-good-primary-turnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a> and <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/11/25/politics/maines-2020-election-turnout-was-among-highest-in-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 elections</a> — the first elections to use ranked-choice voting — was incredibly strong. And in New York, too, <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/6/27/22552850/voter-turnout-2021-nyc-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary turnout was incredibly high</a>; plus, as I mentioned earlier, New Yorkers have said they found <a href="https://queenseagle.com/all/queens-voters-say-ranked-choice-is-as-easy-as-one-two-threefour-five" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked-choice voting to be pretty easy</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/22/nyc-voters-like-easy-ranked-choice-voting-on-primary-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">straightforward</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Personally, I think the evidence suggests that other factors are more important to turnout than the use or non-use of ranked-choice voting. Turnout was super high all across the country in 2018 and 2020, not just in Maine. (It remains to be seen whether that will carry into the 2021-22 cycle.)</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> It does seem as if ranked-choice voting could especially help in primary elections such as New York’s, where there are multiple candidates on the ballot and voters might not know that much about all the candidates. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Imagine if the Democratic primary for president in 2020 had been a ranked-choice election … or the Republican primary for president in 2016. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Well, a few states did use ranked-choice voting in the 2020 Democratic primary. Voters in Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas and Wyoming <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cast ranked-choice ballots</a> in their party-run primaries (their states didn’t have state-run primaries available to use), but all of those states finished voting after the nomination race was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-is-joe-biden-remaking-the-2016-primary-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essentially over in late March</a>, which makes it hard to say just how those rules might have shaped the contest.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, I’m not sure if there’s been any primary-specific research, Sarah, but it stands to reason that ranked-choice voting will be more powerful in races with more than two strong candidates, or multiple candidates who come from the same side of the political spectrum. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For instance, a far-left candidate, a center-left candidate, and a right candidate. Or a Republican primary with four serious contenders.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it may also not make a huge difference there either. The Virginia GOP just used ranked-choice voting to <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20210508/governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pick its governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general candidates</a> for this fall, and the first-round leader wound up being the final winner in all three races. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah: </strong>Yeah, it’s interesting considering there are some downsides to ranked-choice voting — or at least mixed evidence on its effectiveness in solving some of our underlying election problems — that so many municipalities and states are trying ranked-choice voting out. Why?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Voters seem interested in trying it out! (Maybe because they perceive that the current system isn’t producing great results, given how polarized and dysfunctional our politics is.) Maine, New York City, and Alaska, three of the largest American jurisdictions to adopt ranked-choice voting so far, have all done so via ballot measure in the last few years. (Although Massachusetts also <em>rejected</em> a ballot measure to adopt ranked-choice voting <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/11/04/question-two-ranked-choice-voting-massachusetts-no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just last year</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> And in Australia, for example, which uses ranked-choice voting prolifically, <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2018/08/28/opinion/a-century-of-ranked-choice-voting-in-australia-offers-lessons-for-maine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people seem to really like it</a>. The 2018 election marked the 100th anniversary of ranked-choice voting in its national elections. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Motivations for why cities or states have adopted ranked-choice voting may differ, but fundamentally it does seem like an issue if a city or state often elects someone with less than 50 percent of the vote. Such a result makes it harder to say a candidate has the true backing of the electorate. In Maine, for instance, the state had often elected governors <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?year=2018&amp;fips=23&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0&amp;type=state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with less than 50 percent</a>, which was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/12/17448450/maine-ranked-choice-voting-paul-lepage-instant-runoff-2018-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one reason</a> for the drive to implement ranked-choice voting there. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> (Ironically, though, the ranked-choice voting system there doesn’t apply to gubernatorial general elections — just primaries and federal general elections — <a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/lawlibrary/ranked-choice-voting-in-maine/9509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to a ruling</a> by the Maine Supreme Court.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Logically that makes sense to me, Geoffrey, but it’s interesting how that runs counter to the research Nathaniel cited from Clark finding that ranked-choice voting in Maine “produced significantly lower levels of voter confidence, voter satisfaction, and ease of use.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It raises the question of whether any voting reform can really solve some of the underlying ills in America’s electoral system.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>geoffrey.skelley:</strong> Well, the challenge is voters wouldn’t necessarily know they felt that way about ranked-choice voting without first trying it out. And again, as Nathaniel has pointed out, this is a very new thing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Let’s see where people are in a decade. Not all voters <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-11/us-election-voting-changed-by-secret-australian-ballot-history/12726686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessarily liked</a> the secret ballot in the late 19th century (<a href="http://umich.edu/~lawrace/disenfranchise1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes with very good reason</a>), but we all got pretty used to it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Deep cut.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Sharing Waxman’s piece again where <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/ranked-choice-voting-is-not-the-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he essentially argues</a> that ranked-choice voting is not the answer to fixing electoral woes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> I’m not sure anyone is claiming that ranked-choice voting can fix democracy all on its own. Issues of polarization and divisiveness run deeper than that, right into the hearts of voters themselves. The real question is whether it’s better than a first-past-the-post system.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Is it, Nathaniel?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> It does seem like ranked-choice voting has momentum. As I mentioned, several new jurisdictions have adopted it in recent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New York City is an important test case, though, because so many political and media elites live there. So a bad experience with ranked-choice voting there could halt that momentum. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>sarah:</strong> Is there anything we’ve learned so far in the New York City experiment that helps our understanding of ranked-choice voting moving forward? Do we think more states or cities will move to adopt it?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Eh, I’m less inclined to say yes after the Board of Elections snafu.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>nrakich:</strong> Yeah, Alex, but it’s important to note that the Board screw-up and the delay in getting results weren’t due to ranked-choice voting per se. And as you’ve mentioned, New Yorkers seem to be satisfied with the actual voting experience.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Maybe it will come down to whether the media covers this post-election turbulence as a side effect of ranked-choice voting or not. Hopefully they won’t, because that’s not fair.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>alex:</strong> Right, Nathaniel, but I think the error might have repercussions beyond New York — even though the error was Board-specific. Generally speaking, the state of public confidence in elections nationwide right now is at a record low, per <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/321665/confidence-accuracy-election-matches-record-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a>. So when a highly publicized event, like the New York City mayor’s race, takes place and there are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/politics/board-of-elections-nyc-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious errors in counting ballots</a>, that can add more anxiety in the public mind about whether elections (or ranked-choice voting) can be trusted or not. </p>

			<title>New Laws Let Americans With Disabilities Vote Online. They’ve Also Resurrected The Debate About Voting Access vs. Election Security.</title>

<p data-paragraph="main">Since the dawn of the internet, someone has inevitably raised this question every election cycle: Why can’t we vote online? (The question was particularly apt in 2020, when states had to grapple with how to run an election during a pandemic.) And every time, election security experts dutifully answer that there is currently <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-voting-app-wont-solve-our-problems-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no technological way to guarantee a secure online ballot</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite that, some Americans <em>are</em> able to vote online — namely, military and overseas voters — and they have been for more than a decade. Now a handful of states have started expanding this access to include voters with disabilities. Colorado <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a law</a> in May allowing voters with certain disabilities to return ballots online, <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/81st2021/Bill/7442/Overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada</a> passed a similar law in June and other states like <a href="https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2020/09/military-overseas-disabled-voters-have-electronic-absentee-voting-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia</a> are piloting the option. Last month in North Carolina, a federal judge <a href="https://www.acb.org/NC-accessible-voting-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered the state to permanently expand access</a> to online ballot return to voters with vision disabilities — access that was temporarily granted for the November 2020 election, after a coalition of groups including the North Carolina Council of the Blind filed a lawsuit against the state board of elections.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These new laws have reinvigorated a longstanding debate over whether there should be exceptions to the no-online-voting stance. That debate gets at one of the core tensions in election infrastructure: Voting access and voting security are both essential for democracy, but prioritizing one often comes at the expense of the other. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“There is a conflict typically between accessibility and security,” said the University of Florida’s Juan Gilbert, who chairs the computer, information science and engineering department there and studies accessible voting systems. “If you think about it, the most secure thing in the world, whatever it is, is going to be the most inaccessible thing, just by definition.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since 1986, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act has required U.S. states and territories to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/uniformed-and-overseas-citizens-absentee-voting-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow military and overseas voters to cast absentee ballots</a>. In the 2000s, UOCAVA was updated to include a provision so voters could receive their ballots electronically (to be returned by mail). Though there was never any federal mandate to do so, over the years some<strong> </strong>states began expanding their rules to also allow this group of voters to return their ballots online, by email or through web portals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But just because the infrastructure is there doesn’t mean it’s ready for mass use. Voting security experts have consistently argued the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-voting-app-wont-solve-our-problems-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology is not yet advanced enough</a> to allow for a private, secure online voting system. The question is whether even a small allowance for voters serving in the military, residing overseas or living with a disability makes our elections too vulnerable. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The benefits are clear. Michelle Bishop, the voter access and engagement manager for the National Disability Rights Network, said having the option to return ballots electronically could break down some of the myriad barriers that voters with disabilities face. “There are existing challenges in every step of the process,” she said, “from the time you get registered to the time you cast your ballot.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Christopher Bell, the president of the North Carolina Council of the Blind who helped lead last year’s lawsuit against the state’s board of elections, the pandemic highlighted the need for this access. He typically votes in person but like millions of other Americans was less keen on that option during the pandemic. Yet the only alternative — absentee voting by mail — didn’t work for Bell, a blind voter.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A paper ballot means you have to get a sighted person to sit down and help you record your vote. A sighted person can vote absentee privately and independently, but a blind person could not,” Bell said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After the online return was made available to voters with sight disabilities, Bell was able to vote from home. He received his ballot through an online portal, completed it on his own computer using text-to-voice software and returned the ballot electronically through the same portal. Then, an election worker at the local precinct office printed a paper version of the ballot to be counted. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not just voters with sight disabilities who may need to cast their ballots online. Voters with physical disabilities that prevent them from holding or manipulating a paper ballot can’t vote absentee privately either if the only option is by mail. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Advocates of electronic ballot return also say that not all voters with a disability will choose to use this method — many are able to or prefer to vote in person or by mail — but having that option is key for voters who would otherwise be disenfranchised. Because so few voters will use this method, making it a less tempting target, advocates argue the risk of an outside attack is lower (though some security experts disagree). Likewise, the risk of overturning a result is lower too. Bishop called it a “limited, calculated risk.” Critics, however, are concerned not only about the inherent risks of voting online but also about the specific risks of the technology typically used. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democracy Live, a Seattle-based voting-technology company, developed a cloud-based portal that many states currently use to receive absentee ballots from overseas and military voters, and that is now being extended to voters with disabilities. But cybersecurity experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Michigan said its platform, OmniBallot, <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OmniBallot.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has critical flaws</a> that make it vulnerable to attacks and risk voters’ privacy. Bryan Finney, the founder and president of Democracy Live, told FiveThirtyEight that no voting system is 100 percent secure but that the company is constantly working to improve OmniBallot. He noted that OmniBallot uses the Amazon cloud platform, which is also used by the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/496624-dhs-moving-biometrics-database-to-amazon-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Homeland Security</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIA</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some experts believe, however, that there are options that don’t require compromising security <em>or</em> access. Gilbert, from the University of Florida, has spent his career investigating ways to bridge the gap between these two necessities and has developed technological solutions he says could provide alternatives to online voting. One principle of his technology is universality: having all voters, regardless of ability, cast ballots using the same technology, which would allow security and accessibility to work in tandem. Take, for example, his concept called televoting. All absentee voters would send their ballots electronically and watch via livestream as they are printed at a local voting precinct. A machine would both show and read aloud what’s marked on the ballot for the voter’s verification before it is submitted, according to Gilbert. If the machine was hacked to say you voted for candidate A when the ballot says you voted for candidate B, for instance, all the sighted voters would notice it.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The machine wouldn’t know if I’m blind or sighted, it would just read it back. If it reads something different and I’m sighted, we know there’s a problem,” Gilbert said. “That’s why universal design works. If people with varying abilities all use the same thing, it’s hard to target them.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But, so far, Gilbert’s ideas haven’t gained much traction, whereas the much simpler — but also riskier — option of online voting is spreading. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Ultimately, trying to balance security, privacy and access is a tricky puzzle to solve, and technology hasn’t quite nailed it yet. Make our voting systems super-secure and we risk disenfranchising voters. Make them ultra-accessible and we risk undermining our elections. Bell, from the North Carolina Council of the Blind, is keenly aware of the security risks at play but said preventing voters with disabilities from having these tools doesn’t solve the problem alone. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We need to fix the issue,” he said. “But don’t try to fix it on the backs of people with disabilities.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>CORRECTION (July 7, 2021, 10:38 a.m.):</strong> A previous version of this article stated that the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act mandated the electronic return of ballots from overseas and military voters. While some states allow electronic return, the federal act requires only the option to electronically transmit blank ballots to voters.</p>]]></description>
